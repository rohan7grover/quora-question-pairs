0,"I am going to ignore your question and share 5 proven steps to get started investing.Starting your first investment is a lot like climbing a mountain.You‚Äôre starting from ground zero with a lot of enthusiasm, but when you realize you have to climb for days to get anywhere, that enthusiasm often turns into the feeling of being overwhelmed.But when it comes to your investing career, the weather conditions, metaphorically speaking, are terrible as well.Hold on! You have made a smart move to invest in Equity, popularly called as shares. Indian GDP is growing at 6%-7% per annum and as thumb-rule equities deliver return which is equal to GDP growth + Inflation. Equities are best investment vehicle used as a hedge against inflation.Hey! getting started with your first investments is not terribly difficult - Here's what I would do to start my first investment and build up to $1000, $2000, $10,000‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶permonth in ""passive"" income.SEBI regulated a tight charge over documents submission. So this makes it a most crucial step. Your names, dates, and signature should be identical on all of your submitted docs.Below are the exact 4 basic documents that one need to get registered as a stock trader with SEBI.PAN cardIdentity proof (Aadhar card, driving license etc)Bank statement (last 6 month)Cancelled chequeThese are the basic documents. However, in some rare case, additional documents are needed. Consult the broker for the same.In addition, you would also have to fill up the registration form to which the above documents would be attached (highlighted in next step).But where do you submit the damn documents?This is what I‚Äôm going to show you in step 2.Not only brokers help you to get your documents verified with SEBI, they also facilitate live trading in stock market. You can buy and sell stocks with just one call or one click (on trading app, platforms)What you‚Äôve to do is contact a broker and deliver them registration form with above-attached documents.But still one should choose a broker with great attention. Some brokers charge so high that most of your profit is swallowed by their charges. An uncle of mine generated a brokerage of 1.5 lakh in 2 months on F&O trading. I was baffled after seeing his charge-sheet.When was the last time you read an investing book or an economic magazine article? Do your daily reading habits center around hot tips tweets, Facebook updates, or the directions on moneycontrol website? If you‚Äôre one of the countless people who doesn't make a habit of reading books and articles regularly, you might be missing out: reading has a significant number of benefits on your investments and your market behavior.Step away from your computer stock screen for a little while, crack open a book, and replenish your soul for a little while.Below are 3 books which are highly recommended to beginners.Stocks to Riches: Insights on Investor Behavior (by Parag Parikh)My personal opinion: At my earlier days, I started reading highly suggested books but didn‚Äôt benefit more than this book. In my opinion, this book is a key to understanding other books. Just an extremely insightful book of great practical value that every investor, both beginners and the experienced, should read. No more words.Rich Dad Poor Dad (by Robert T. Kiyosaki)My personal opinion: This is my all time favorite. This book has also qualified for the Amazon Best Reads List ‚Äì June‚Äô16. This book what made me understand the crux of value investing and spread a great message of how money makes money.The Little Book That Still Beats the Market (by Joel Greenblatt)Side Note: Still I‚Äôm finding this book to read. Also tried to buy this book on Amazon but not in stock. Contact me personally if you can endorse this book to me. I read summary and reviews of others on this book and find it interesting. He made the value investing simple by just following ROCE and ROE matrix.Edit: ..."

2,"Using DNS functionality, you can use your computer's ""hosts"" file to redirect slow and/or unnecessary servers to localhost (your own computer).¬† For example, if there's a website you go to with¬† large ads or a slow metrics server, you can create entries for the server names in your hosts file so your PC won't be able to send or receive data from them.¬† (For example, Spybot S&D does this to block known malware and tracking servers, which will speed up browsing by reducing traffic to and from your computer and those specific servers.)You can also cache DNS lookups locally, however many browsers already do this.¬† If yours doesn't, or you want to use this speedup across all the computers on your network, try using your router's built-in DNS if it has one. Some, for example those running DD-WRT firmware, can be made to cache DNS lookups improving speed.¬† (Your PCs use your router for DNS, the router uses your ISP for DNS.)"

4,"Ah, the old ‚Äúdrown ‚Äôem or desiccate ‚Äòem‚Äù question. This turns out to be a real thinker. Let‚Äôs begin, shall we..The basics: There are 1.386 billion cubic kilometers of water on Planet Earth. Eliminating all of it would surely kill us (since we‚Äôre made largely of water), but we‚Äôd probably die before then due to atmospheric disturbances. See, the oceans provide much of our oxygen and house huge stores of carbon dioxide. By eliminating the water, carbon dioxide would flood into the air and poison us.However, we could survive this. We could remain in buildings that had the ability to filter out carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. Most humans would die, but a few would survive.Once all the water was gone, though, we‚Äôd have to manufacture our own‚Ä¶but it would just disappear every second. So, I‚Äôm going to say that 1.386 billion seconds after water starts disappearing, we all die. That‚Äôs around 44 years.Quick.Now, what about the flood? Can it kill us before then?This one requires a bit more math, and some interesting mental discussions. For example, could a suitably large breeding population of people live at the bottom of the ocean indefinitely? I think the answer to that question is ‚Äúyes‚Äù, though doing so would involve a massive undertaking of nuclear / geothermal power research as well as improvements to the technology of food production under those rather harsh environments. But do we have the time to do that research and prepare the habitats before the world is inundated?For this, we‚Äôll need a spherical shell of water high enough to cover Mt. Everest. The volume of that shell is given byùëâ=43ùúã(ùëÖ3‚àíùëü3)V=43œÄ(R3‚àír3)V = \frac{4}{3}\pi(R^3 - r^3)Now, this isn‚Äôt exactly a spherical shell (the Earth is oblate) and there‚Äôs all that land in the way.How much land?Well, thanks to Quora, this great website where one can find answers of this kind, I read this:John Flavin's answer to What is the volume of Earth's above-sea-level landmass, and would all this land fit inside the planet's oceans?Which says that there are 125 million cubic kilometers of land above sea level. So whatever volume we get from the spherical shell, we‚Äôll subtract the 1.25E8.So, the radius of the Earth, at sea level, is 6,371 km. Mt. Everest is just 8.848 km tall, so our outer radius is 6379.8 km.Plugging all of that in gives us 4.495 billion cubic kilometers. Subtracting away the land volume above sea level reduces this to about 4.37 billion cubic kilometers of water.At 1 sec per cubic kilometer, we have 138.47 years before there is no dry land (side note: Noah‚Äôs flood seems even more ridiculous, in light of the fact that it would take 138.47 years to cover all of the land at the astonishing rate of a cubic kilometer of water created per second).You might think ‚ÄúAha! Desiccation for the win!‚ÄùBut allow me to point out that it‚Äôs 138.47 years for Mt. Everest to be covered. We‚Äôd have a lot less time before ordinary ‚Äúland‚Äù would be covered. In fact, if we just stop at land that is less than just 3 km high (which is pretty high - above that altitude, there are no trees and the soil is practically non-existent) we have only 1.5 billion seconds, or 47.5 years.Long before then, 99.9% of the people on the planet are displaced from their homes by salt water. Water that is going to make farming impossible and quickly starve us.But would we all die? No. I can envision a few people clinging to existence, eating only fish and slowly climbing mountainsides to avoid the rising seas.So I‚Äôm giving this one to desiccation, but only barely. We definitely would struggle to maintain our existence on a flooded world with barely a decade before complete disruption of 99% of the population of our planet. But could we hang on for 44 years? Yes, I think we could.One last thought: There is an enormous amount of water in the crust and mantle. If we consider that, too, then perhaps humans don‚Äôt immediately turn to dry powder 44 years out. In that case, we might just survive longer with the drying than with the flood, though the removal of water from the crust and mantle would result in massive geological instabilities, volcanic eruptions, earthquakes, and an actual collapse of our planet‚Äôs crust. So yeah, probably not.Either way, Everyone Dies‚Ñ¢"
5,"You are a monster of ambition, even if you do not show it outwardly. Your desire to better yourself and achieve something tangible, lasting in life is almost certainly very strong indeed. You definitely ‚Äúplay the long game‚Äù, taking one step at a time, until your goals are reached; you don‚Äôt mind if it doesn‚Äôt happen overnight‚Ä¶ it will take decades, and you are cool with that. The goals you have are slow, but steady; you are more the tortoise than the hare. You almost surely agree with the statement: ‚ÄúI‚Äôm a firm believer in luck; and the harder I work, the more luck I find that I have.‚Äù You have a realistic idea of how the world works, and you will trust what people DO long before you will trust what people SAY. You probably are sparing with words, but long on action. You probably are quite modest and seemingly unassuming‚Ä¶ even when you are a success, you do not over-aggrandize yourself. You probably have a superb, dry sense of humor. You like art, music and architecture which has withstood the passage of time, taking a dim view of new fads which are merely ‚Äúflashes in the pan‚Äù. You love what lasts, what endures. You probably dress conservatively, and often do not need to be the center of attention; you know that visibility‚Äî and sterling reputation‚Äî can be two very different things. You probably love the outdoors, and may be a superb fisherman, camper, explorer, naturalist, gardener, landscaper or carpenter, and your home is almost surely filled with interesting things you‚Äôve made by hand, and souvenirs of fascinating places you‚Äôve visited. You love animals very much and almost certainly own a dog. You do not mind rolling your sleeves up, perspiring and getting dirty. You are a great ‚ÄúMcGyver‚Äù, and know how to improvise and make do with limited resources. You love to help people when they need it the most. You may have a taste for some choice, expensive things‚Äî such as car or clothing or jewelry‚Äî- yet for the most part you are not especially consumed with a need for flashy luxury. You may have a traditional religion, because you like things that have very old reputations and philosophies. When you visit a new city, it will be the very old, historical sites that attract you the most.Basically, in this life, your soul had the purpose of richly living in the real, concrete world and respecting things that are sturdy, reliable and natural. And people who are, too. You prefer to let others pontificate and philosophize and write about life; you‚Äôre too busy living it."
6,"First of All, ask yourself this Question ‚ÄúDo you really want to keep away your children far from the Mobile and TV?‚Äù.If Yes, then it will take A lot of Your Time and Availability for your Children and you will have to replace your TV and Mobile with yourself.Now, let‚Äôs find out why did our children are showing more interest towards the Mobile Phone and TV?Because, we do not have time these days and busy doing other things (i.e. busy with our career and balancing social life etc). Everyday (except weekends) starts with a full throttle run and ends thinking about the next day.Childrens/Kids do not understand this race and they have their own needs. At first, we try our level best to fulfill those needs because that is not negotiable and as soon as the time flies, we try to negotiate their needs with what we have.Nowadays, Mobile Phone are the fourth necessity of the human life after Bread, Cloths and Shelter (Roti, Kapda & Makan) and almost everybody have a mobile phone, so at first we try to negotiate with the Mobile phone.Kids are Curious to learn and they are also very much adoptable. They learn things very fast and as soon as you handover a mobile phone to a kid they start exploring it (just after they come out of their fear). They find it quite useful because they can do whatever they want to.The same goes with the TV.Now, if you can take yourself back around 10‚Äì15 years, you will realize our parents have a lot of time for us. As our family used to be a Joint and Giant one, we used to get the same participation from our Uncles, Aunts and other relative. We used to have very few toys but that were somehow manageable with all the cousins and friends.Back then, the life was not so rushing and our parents had time for us. That‚Äôs why we did not have any interest towards these things.So, if you want to keep your children away from TV and Mobile, then do not negotiate with your role as a parent with a mobile and TV.‚ÄúWhen they need you, make yourself available. Do not walk away making any negotiation.‚ÄùPeace :)"
7,"This is one of the nicest questions I‚Äôve seen!Well, here‚Äôs some pointers to what makes a difference in what is one of the most extraordinary and fundamental professions‚Ä¶..Humility. The Earth is greater than all of us. Up until now it has provided the basis of our everything. And equally it can take it all away in a flash.The ability to imagine. What you see now in our world is not necessarily what has come before and the Earth System has a track record that goes back 4.6 billion years‚Ä¶..but has only preserved a portion of its tale. The rest we have to infer.Ability to handle uncertainty. Unless you can pick up something in your hand and sample it, then you‚Äôll always be relying on stand-off (second-hand) analysis of what it is. Often, you will be sampling no more than a trillionth of the bigger picture.Synthesis. You will pull from a myriad of sources of information from the nanometric to the galactic. And you may voyage through this universe in a single day.Grace. You will tap into all the other grand sciences which peer down at you, but you will have a wry smile to yourself that without you no-one would understand Home.Passion. How can you not be excited by the Earth? This is a subject you never need to switch off from and keeps giving for as long as you ask questions.A Story-Teller. You are suspicious of dogma for you know that too much is unknown, but there is still much meaning to be gleaned from careful and fair observation.Patience. You will never likely have all the facts. But you are adding to a Great Story.A capacity to never stop learning. Your ‚Äúoffice‚Äù will be the grandest thing you‚Äôre ever likely to encounter and you will only ever discover a proportion of what there is to know about it.I therefore tend to believe that a Good Geologist has many of the qualities of a Good Human Being."

12,"You need to see the application of physics around yourself to create interest in physics.Eg) Say you are driving and there is a sharp corner where negotiating speed limit is stated. Your study of physics will help you understand how this speed limit is arrived at. You see a bridge with a maximum weight limit stated.Physics will help you to understand how this maximum number was arrived at. So to develop interest, try to find how things happening in your surrounding are related to physics principles. Physics is not a hard subject to master or understand. It mostly involves application of rules, such as Ohm‚Äôs law for electricity for electrical circuits or to measure current when you know component resistance and voltage applied, or newtons laws for motions to find distance traveled or speed after certain time, etc. One way you can improve your knowledge and interest is to read Physics books written by different authors. This will make it easier to understand the concepts. I used to be in your situation and improved when I did what I have stated herein.Hope I helped :)"
13,"Definitely a memorable experience :-) I had to take permission of the guy before writing this, and he told me that I can only write it when we both are together. So here is how it went-He was my first boyfriend, a guy from school who managed to woo me during Junior College (Class 11th). We were teenagers when we started dating, and it was quite normal to be curious. So our late night phone conversations tended to get quite naughty. But we had to wait until after Junior College for it to happen for the first time.His parents had gone away for a week, and so we had finally made our plans. He somehow got the condoms procured. I had a good session at the beauty parlour the day before.I arrived at his place in the afternoon, wearing a spaghetti purple crop top, denim jeans and jacket and he was kind of already excited when I rang his doorbell (Could make out from what I saw in his shorts).We went to his bedroom making sure we had locked both, the main door and his bedroom door. He made me sit beside him on the bed and locked his lips onto mine. After a good, long, passionate kiss, he took my jacket off and began kissing and licking my sensitive neck and ears from behind. That was the point where I knew I wasn't going to be able to resist that day.He then helped me out of my jacket and after making me lie down, began to kiss my hands and teased the bare skin of my belly with a finger for sometime before getting me out of my spaghetti top. I remembered the look on his face when he first saw my breasts- like the way a kid looks on for a candy. After some passionate lovemaking to my breasts, he slid my jeans and panties down and proceeded to tease my clit with his tongue, making sure I had a couple of orgasms already before he decided to penetrate me. When he first went in, I felt a sharp stab of pain, which slowly subsided even as he could no longer resist thrusting hard till he finally collapsed.After laying beside each other for sometime, he carried me in his arms to the shower and helped me wash. And we had some light dinner, and then cuddled into each other in bed as we went into a dreamy sleep.So yeah, quite a good first sex experience. We dated for a couple of years after that, but had to split, though we still remain good friends. He's with me right now, as he helped me write this answer and we're alone. Good night readers. :D"
14,"Unfortunately, there is no legal way to change your student visa to a green card in the US. One of the easiest and fastest ways to get a US green card is to marry a US citizen. We put together a short video addressing that.We are not sure how the immigration status can be obtained in Japan."
15,"I don‚Äôt talk about personal politics on public forums; instead, I will stick to facts as much as possible. In short, everything below I believe to be true, but not everything I believe is true is written below. (-:It‚Äôs far too early to know for sure exactly what the impact will be. As of this writing (mid-Nov 2016) we don‚Äôt even know who is going to be in key policy positions. Then, we don‚Äôt know how the Senate and House will react to their policy views. We don‚Äôt know how much party-line‚Äîcrossing there will be; likely very little for the most part, but that is harder to predict if a policy is clearly prejudicial or damaging to the economy at large.Now, in terms of impact, there are personal impacts and job impacts.In terms of job impacts, it seems highly unlikely that anyone who is well-educated will do poorly in the short term. The US has tremendous economic opportunities for people who are skilled in high-value fields. Those companies are not going to fill their jobs out of nowhere. If the government starts to put in place policies that make it difficult to hire talented employees, companies will take those positions to where the employees are ‚Äî abroad ‚Äî creating exactly the opposite situation of what Trump promised when he ran. Of course, politics rarely follows along strictly rational lines of calculation, but ultimately it‚Äôs therefore important to separate bluster for the press versus what actually happens quietly in the background.Keep in mind, also, that if the job market does change by the time you graduate, unless the Revolution comes, you‚Äôre hardly the one who will be impacted. Anyone who is willing to pick up sticks, move half-way around the world, deal with differences in language and food and climate and a dozen other things, is likely going to have a place somewhere in the world. Getting a quality education can only help that.In terms of personal impacts, it might depend quite a bit on what you look like ‚Äî in some locations. However, the vast majority especially of US research universities are not located in the places that are also appear to be the most prejudiced. Indeed, this election further widened the gap between urban and rural areas, and urban areas resoundingly voted for a more global perspective. A student at Brown doesn‚Äôt live in the USA as much as they live in Providence, a vibrant, multi-cultural town with numerous nationalities and races represented broadly. Inasmuch as you think the vote for Trump says anything, only about five states gave Clinton a higher percentage of vote (and not by much) than Rhode Island. So to someone who lived here, on a day-to-day basis, there would hardly be any perceptible difference in treatment. If anything, at this moment many people are especially sensitive and careful about how they treat others.It is also easy to forget how much progress has been made in the US. People reading about the election from a distance, getting news dominated by Trump, might be surprised to hear that in this election season, the US has voted in [list courtesy Brighten Godfrey]:Stephanie Murphy (FL) ‚Äî first Vietnamese-American woman elected to CongressCatherine Cortez Masto (NM) ‚Äî first Latina elected to U.S. SenatePramila Jayapal (WA) ‚Äî first person of South Asian descent elected to House of RepresentativesKamala Harris (CA) ‚Äî first person of South Asian descent elected to U.S. SenateIlhan Omar (MN) ‚Äî first Somali-American legislator (she was elected to the state house of representatives)Kate Brown (OR) ‚Äî first openly LGBTQ governorTammy Duckworth (IL) ‚Äî first female senator that has seen combat, and second Asian-American female senatorSamuel Park (GA) ‚Äî first openly gay man in the Georgia legislatureand so on. I bet those stories were not covered in the international press. Note that Ilhan Omar is openly Muslim, and even wears a hijab. There are many Muslim countries where she could not even stand for election.Finally, just remember that eight years ago the USA voted in its first black president. Things go in cycles. History is long, and bears reading.Personally, I‚Äôm pretty confident I could mail out my resume to a bunch of different countries and get pretty positive responses. (When something happens in the US, I get notification from foreign friends of job postings at their university‚Ä¶.) Let‚Äôs just say I haven‚Äôt dusted off my vita at all. In time, I think most things heal themselves. In the meanwhile, I‚Äôm committed to doing what I can to improve the education of students and state of knowledge‚Äîthe very same things I was committed to the day before the election."
16,"Like a lot of English words, it has two levels of meaning: literal and figurative.

18,"Quora might hope that you use Quora for all knowledge searches.I would suggest you use Google when you are seeking information and Quora when you are seeking explanation.Whether it is bad depends on perspective.¬† Quora wants to own a database with all of the world's knowledge so they can convert that into a boatload of money.¬† So, of course they welcome people asking those simple questions.¬† I think it can be bad from the perspective of the users.¬† It clutters the feed with crap.¬† I expect my feed to be filled with content that will be interesting to read, not simplistic factoids that can be found anywhere.¬† Encouraging easy questions on Quora makes Quora a less enjoyable place for me.I don't understand why people do it.¬† It just doesn't make any kind of sense to me.¬† Why would someone come to Quora, click on add question, type their question, click through all of the prompts about topics and being sure the question hasn't already been asked and then wait a few hours for the question to make it into the feed of someone willing to answer it, when they could just type the question in their browser search bar and get an immediate answer from Google?There are some questions that Google can handle much better than Quora can.¬† It can provide a better, more concise, vetted answer and in an instant.¬† Quora should stick to specializing on what it does better than Google - provide direct contact with people that understand something, so a conversation can happen to bring that understanding to others.A year ago, there was an annoying series of questions each asking for the name of the actor that played a specific character in the 1970s-1980s television sitcom M*A*S*H.¬† One after another, the questions worked their way through the whole cast.¬† ""Who played Nurse Houlihan on MASH?"", ""Who played BJ Honeycutt on MASH?"", on through to¬† ""Who played Hawkeye Pierce on MASH?""Typing that into Google provides:What could a Quora member possibly provide that would improve on that answer?¬† No amount of expertise or experience will provide a more accurate or precise answer than Alan Alda.¬† No amount of literary flourish will make that answer more effective.¬† I used this example on one of the Quora Facebook groups and another member vigorously disagreed.¬† They said that you never know when one of the Quora members that comes across that simplistic question might actually have something to share, such as they grew up on the same street as Alan Alda and have a story to share.¬† And that, they said, was the justification to allow such basic questions on Quora.My view is - no.¬† If people want a story about Alan Alda, they should ask for it.¬† Maybe something like ""What are anecdotes about Alan Alda that Quora members can share?""It just makes no sense.¬† If someone is seeking stories about Alan Alda, they aren't going to type ""Who played Hawkeye Pierce on MASH?"" in the Quora search field.I want to see thoughtful questions in my feed so that I can read thoughtful answers and I can write thoughtful answers.¬† Question askers have as much responsibility to maintain quality on Quora as answerers do.¬† So, yes, I think it is bad to ask questions on Quora that could be easily answered on Google. It's your responsibility to ask better questions on Quora."
19,"I think Victorious Digital is the best digital marketing training institute & courses in Pune. As we all know that digital marketing is buzzing around us and every business and services are turning themselves to online from traditional marketing . Hence, Digital marketing jobs are increasing day by day, month after month and comparatively digital marketing experts availability is very less, Thats the reason people are getting involved into digital marketing and learning it by themselves.When I was looking best digital marketing training institute in Pune for myself only, I went through various digital marketing institutes in and around Pune, But i was not satisfied with course structure and expensive fees. So, I decided to learn digital marketing some other resources like you tube or other online medium.

21,"How can I stop being clingy and jealous?By being Confident and working on your insecurities.When I say confident, I mean being confident in who you are, what you do and who you are with. Let me share you my personal experience. In my early days of dating I once dated a beauty pageant. It was actually intimidating for me. Why?! Before that I was a book worm throughout my life and had zero girlfriends in my early life. I started doing research work in science and engineering from an early age as well, which gained me some popularity for a time being, which in case gave me some opportunity with women. But because I had limited knowledge of being with opposite sex, so I wasn't sure of myself, on how to be with one. So when I started dating this beauty pageant, I always used to feel overwhelmed.‚ÄúAm I worthy of being with ‚Äòher‚Äô?! Com‚Äôon. Look at her. She's a beauty and every one longs to be with her. Why did she choose to date meeeeee????!!‚Äù This is what used to go through my mind all the time. You see, I had insecurities (I still have some now) and I wasn't confident of who I was and the fact that I did deserve better.Recently I read a book, ‚ÄúThe Truth‚Äù by Neil Strauss (author, journalist), which talks about the truth behind most of the relationships, and I agree with most of it. All of us have a wounded child in us. Some of us try to protect that child and some don't or can't. I also had a wounded past, a wounded child within me, which made be clingy and jealous.‚ÄúWhat if she leaves me?‚Äù‚ÄúWhat if she meets someone better?‚Äù‚ÄúWhat if she is not interested in me any more?‚ÄùThese are few of the many questions which used to go through my mind. All because of my own lack of self confidence and insecuties.It was only through time and experience that made me realise that you can not keep someone by being clingy and jealous. You can not chain a person up and force them to stay with you. If they want to stay, they will stay or else they will leave, sooner or later. All you can do is to be who you are, to be confident on who you are, be confident in what you want and what you do, and do what makes you happy. He or she will be there with you if they want to anyway.Continuing with my story, my clinginess and jealousy paid off, and resulted into a broken relationship. We stopped dating and went separate ways. All because I thought I wasn't worthy enough. But in the process I learnt a valuable lesson in life.Fast forward to present. That lesson helped me to improve as a person and now I am with an amazing person, who loves me for who I am, and I can't be more grateful."
22,"Dear Chris,you are spamming Quora with hundreds (11 hundreds at the moment of me writing this answer) of low-quality questions and the empty link to the site Yahoo!Answers. You may argue that questions such asWhere is the belly button located on the human body?Are NASCAR drivers allowed to have a flat top hairstyle?Can kids and teenagers have light golden brown hair?Is it ok for a police officer to be 6 feet tall?Is it fine for a male high school student to have the hair color medium brown?are actually high-quality and very educating, but I assure you, Quora is a very good instrument that could be put to much better use.You are asking what question you should ask. Ask something that will really contribute to your pool of knowledge and can potentially improve your life. Maybe not about Brian Urlacher and Brett Favre again. Maybe not about white briefs again. Maybe do not include the link to Yahoo Answers anymore; not only does it not lead anywhere but to the site itself, but it adds meaningless noise to your questions as a source link and seems to be in poor taste. If you like Yahoo so much, why not ask on Yahoo instead?Quora can be a source of fantastic answers about dinosaurs, medieval literature, the color wheel, black holes, poaching, deadly viruses, social changes of the 20th century, Japanese cinema, meditation practices, etc. If you honestly want to know (and not simply to ask questions just for the sake of adding the Yahoo link), broaden your horizons just a little bit.Be sure that I am not condemning you, but hey, you did ask - and this is my heartfelt advice to you."

24,"To overlap, at least one of the two hands must rotate fully. This answer uses the brainless infinite catchup approach, the first three iterations of which are noted:In the time it takes for the minute hand to have made its first full rotation from 12:00, the hour hand reaches 1:00. This means the overlap period is at least 1 hour, i.e. 60 minutes.Now, for the minute hand to catch up to the hour hand, the minute hand must move from 12:00 to at least 1:00. This adds 1/12th of an hour, i.e. 5 minutes, to the overlap period. The total overlap period is now at least 60 + 5 = 65 minutes.In these last 5 minutes, the hour hand has of course moved a bit further still, certainly less than a minute. Using the pattern mentioned earlier, the hour hand has moved exactly 5m*60s/12, i.e. 25 seconds. We‚Äôre now at at a total overlap period of at least 65m:25s.To recap, the first three terms were 1 hour, 5 minutes, and 25 seconds. Equivalently, these are 1 hour, (1/12) of an hour, and (1/12) of (1/12) of an hour. These can be rewritten as 1/(12^0), 1/(12^1), and 1/(12^2).If we continue this catchup pattern and do the total, we arrive at the sum of 1/(12^x) for x from 0 to infinity. This adds up to 1.0909‚Ä¶ hours or 65.4545‚Ä¶ minutes (see the links). The Python code for approximating the same in minutes is sum(60/(12**i) for i in range(15)).Since we now know the overlap period in hours, to determine the number of times it happens in a day, divide 24 by it, i.e. 24/1.0909‚Ä¶ , giving us exactly 22. Thus, the hour and the minute hands overlap 22 times a day."

26,"1. Spring MVCOld but gold, Spring MVC is still ahead of the curve after more than a decade since its first release. After its expansion to embrace complete MVC framework, Spring kept on evolving adopting changes and turned into a full-scale Java framework for Internet-facing applications, offering software engineers a powerful toolkit for web application development and application configuration as well as for security projects. Being one of the most favoured among programmers, Spring has a well-developed ecosystem, offering a variety of add-ons to choose from: REST APIs or SOAP web services, security (authentication and authorisation, encryption), etc. Another benefit of this choice is that a big company of fellow developers who chose to use this particular Java framework, too. Thus, they are ready to give you a helping hand with any query you might have.Pros and ConsSpring is not nesting in the top of the charts without reason. It is one of the best and most well-known Java frameworks because of:Simplified injection of test data through the use of POJOs.Enhanced modularity, resulting in better code readability.Loose coupling between different modules.Dependency Injection (DI) flexible use.Although not a direct framework downside, regardless of the piles of reference documentation, Spring MVC might be more than newbie Java devs can chew, making the learning curve too steep. Thus, dealing with some parts of this Java framework can be tough for if you bump into a poorly documented chunk of references. The info you find might be different across versions.By the way, due to our engineers' great experience, Spring MVC is one of our most fancied frameworks.2. Struts 2To elaborate even more on existing Java frameworks that are widely used by modern software engineers, we decided to refer to the successor of Apache‚Äôs Struts 1, Struts 2. This Java framework is quite a find for engineers who work with building contemporary Java EE web apps. The Apache Software Foundation has equipped developers with an extensive tool for creating enterprise-ready, web-facing applications, optimizing the development process from the beginning to the final point and post-go-live maintenance. This concept is the right choice if you sweat over high-load systems such as broadcasting portals.Testing the written code takes less effort because of Struts 2's implemented Action class ‚Äì plain POJO objects. Coupling becomes easier with the framework‚Äôs API, helping to tune Interceptors.Pros and ConsWhen you ask yourself why you should consider Struts 2, consider the luxury of not having to override or implement the Action class ‚Äì it is already in place! Repetitive setup code that IT engineers need to create for several actions is no longer a concern because Interceptors take care of it.However, you might get turned off by the weight of this Java framework: some programmers find it‚Äôs not agile enough to go for.3. HibernateAlthough not on RebelLabs‚Äô list either, it is worth mentioning Hibernate when debating the best Java framework. This mapping Java framework cracks object-relational impedance mismatch issues by substituting persisting DB accesses high-level object handling functions. With every enterprise application being one of a kind, Hibernate is equipped with a great feature suite that helps backend developers fine-tune data access layer. This is an advanced ORM framework that lets you perform the database operation on Java objects (entities). It is a persistence concept that utilizes Hibernate cache to persist the data from the Java environment to the database.Pros and ConsHibernate allows you to communicate with any database using tiny alterations in the code you write, bridging the gap between objects and relational words. On top of that:Oracle, Db2, or MySQL, Hibernate is DB independent.Caching mechanism to bug database with similar queries.N+1 or Lazy l..."

29,"Here you go!First Year of ArticleshipMy CA final attempt was due in Nov 2017 and my preparations did not begin any earlier than other CA Final candidates. I had joined a mid-sized firm in Chennai in April 2015. My batch mates had already started their preparation and had joined various classes while my mind kept repeating that maybe it was too early! After considering facts and combating confusion for days I decided not to study in my first year. I decided to devote that year to cricket and was playing the 5th division of the Tamil Nadu Cricket Association League. Matches were usually held early in the morning, so this decision dint really create any impact my articleship. Apart from cricket, I was also interested in the stock market and started investing and reading about the same. One line summary ‚Äìno CA Final preparation in the 1st year.Here is my performance in the league (not very great though)BattingBowlingCA Final Preparation in Second Year of ArticleshipHaving missed the bus on purpose in the 1st year, I had to make up for it in the 2nd year. While others were doing one class at a time, I was left with no option but to join two classes simultaneously. I joined FR and AMA in June 2016. I preferred classes over self-study for practical subjects because I always felt that the expert teaching the subject simplifies it and if I were to study the same on my own, I would end up spending twice the time to understand the concepts. I was very attentive in the class (when you sacrifice the early morning sleep, you better pay attention) and ensured that 60% of the preparation was done in my class itself, which is the whole point of joining a coaching class. Once the classes were done in September 2016, there was a 2-month break. I ensured that 80% of the preparation was done in these 2 months for FR and AMA. The focus was more on understanding the concepts rather than solving sums from the material ICAI had provided.The next set of classes began in December 2016 when I joined SFM and DT. Since I missed study in Year 1, I had to catch up on other subjects too. With 2 classes already ongoing, I decided to join Law in February 2017 too. At this stage, I had classes every day morning and evening, and articleship in between. The only reason I used to go home was to sleep. The moment I got into bed, I was almost dead! I literally felt so low at this stage that I decided to quit the Law class. That was when reality hit me hard and I realized that I had become a machine ‚Äì running in cycles! My day was about getting up, going to class, then office, then again class, home, dinner, study, and sleep‚Ä¶‚Ä¶..! Was there a life? No there wasn‚Äôt. My heart longed for the field. I was REALLY missing the early morning matches. I was desperate for a break but then that was a far fetched dream! And then one day it hit me that I hadn‚Äôt touched my cricket bat for almost a year! How could I stay away from the one thing I loved? The CA Final course had made me ignorant of everything beautiful I was surrounded by! Just when SFM and DT were about to get over, the registration for IDT classes had begun and batches were starting from the very next day. Break had become a Utopian concept then!IDT started in April 2017 and I just didn‚Äôt like the class. I quit it midway and started to prepare for the subject on my own. But then AMA and ISCA were also to be focused on! So well! I guess my summer of 2017 was planned!CA Final Preparation Plan in Study LeaveNot sure if this was the break I was looking for! My study leave started from June 2017 and I had solid 5 months for preparation time. Wait a minute, I hadn‚Äôt seen my love for more than a year. And a cricket tournament was lined up in June and July. I made up my mind to play the tournament and my Sundays were spent for my love. Played the tournament, got the man of the series award and parted with my beloved once ag..."
30,"I always think I'll study later in the night.Fact is I can never pull an all-nighter. In fact I work at 1/10 of my regular speed after 11 pm. And if I'm beyond 3pm, I'm gonna sleep the whole next day.But I still do it.All due to my habit of procrastination."
31,"Sounds like allergies, probably dust-mites. Dust-mites are microbes that eat dead skin-cells that nest in bedding-material, and they produce a waste-product which is a powerful allergen to many people.First, see an an allergist, and determine if you‚Äôre allergic to this or other possible causes. Be sure to tell the allergist about this problem, and ask what you can do about it, medications etc.2. Then, buy casing for your matress, box-springs and pillows, like these:Amazon.com: SLEEP SAFE BED BUG, DUST MITE, and ALLERGEN PROOF ""QUEEN 12"""" Mattress ZipCover, Size: Queen 60"" x 80"" x 12""deep ENCASEMENT L Zipper - compare price: Home & KitchenAmazon.com: Assure Sleep ‚ÄúBed Bug Proof‚Äù Box Spring Encasement, 54 Inch X 75 Inch, Full Size: Home & KitchenAmazon.com: SLEEP SAFE BED BUG, DUST MITE, and ALLERGEN PROOF - STANDARD Pillow ZipCover, Size: Standard 21"" x 27"" Pillow ENCASEMENT: Home & Kitchen3. Likewise, buy a HEPA air-filter like this one to keep it by the bed:Amazon.com: GermGuardian AC4825, 3-in-1 Air Cleaning System with True HEPA, UV-C and Odor Reduction, 22-Inch: Health & Personal Care4. Next, be sure to keep the area vacuumed at least weekly.5. Finally, be sure to wash all sheets, blankets and pillowcases etc at least weekly in hot water.These protocols should help reduce any allergies from dust-mites, and other sources.Another good idea is a de-humidier, since dust-mites as well as molds grow in humidity, along with dust-mites,and these are the 2 primary sources of allergies.This is good not only against allergies, but also damage to your house, mold on the walls, etc, so a large-size dehumidifier is best."
32,"I agree with other answers over here. The probability of Nights King dishing out mercy is much more likely than expecting mercy from the Boltons, Cersei or any other dubious characters on the show.The mercy meter can be measured only by the number of people spared by a character. And quite surprisingly, the Nights Kings has the highest mercy rate among the characters the OP mentioned.He let Jon go at the Battle of Hardhome. He let Bran go after marking him.His plans or motives for letting these characters go might be dark but still I am going to count them as mercy, especially in the case of Jon.The Nights King isn't human and expectation of mercy from a non-human is a laughable concept but GRRM/ showrunners in their own ways have tried to convey the message that sometimes humans are way worse than our worst nightmares."
33,"Imagine you are holding a party balloon. A balloon maintains its shape because inside that balloon are more than a sextillion independent gas molecules flying around at high speed, bouncing off of every part of the interior surface, pushing it outwards. If I walk up and pop the balloon with a pin, what do you expect to happen?Each of those gas molecules instead of hitting the inside surface of the balloon will continue traveling in a straight line, away from where the balloon once was. They will continue on those trajectories until they hit something (e.g. another gas molecule or dust in the air) or their velocity is decreased to zero, by gravity.The ISS is analogous to a giant balloon ‚Äì not so much in that its shape is held by the trapped gas ‚Äì it isn‚Äôt, aluminum holds the shape ‚Äì but that inside the ISS there are many, many septillions of gas molecules zipping around inside it. Those gas molecules fly into walls and bounce off towards another wall. They bounce off of each other. That‚Äôs the natural state of trapped gas.But if we were to make a hole in the ISS, any gas molecules that, in their journeys, crossed the surface of that hole into space, would continue traveling out into space. There is nothing out there for them to bounce off of and return back in through the hole. These gas molecules are traveling at about half a kilometer per second. There is no ‚Äúsucking‚Äù happening, there is simply an open door and eventually everything inside would go outside and have no reason to come back inside.The Earth doesn‚Äôt have a balloon surface around it to hold the atmosphere in. The atmosphere remains where it is, even though the gas molecules in the atmosphere are also traveling at around half a kilometer per second, because of gravity. The Earth is a massive object, so it has a significant gravitational field. A gas molecule that hits the ground at 500 m/s and bounces off, heading straight upwards will not escape because first, it will hit many other gas molecules that change its trajectory, many, many times per second, but because of gravity, any upward velocity will gradually decrease.For a moment, let‚Äôs ignore the molecules above our bouncing molecule that cause a trajectory change with each collision, and let‚Äôs just look at what gravity will do to a single upward traveling molecule. What will happen? What does Sir Isaac say?Sir Isaac's First Law of Motion tells us that......every object will remain at rest or in uniform motion in a straight line unless compelled to change its state by the action of an external force.There is only one force acting upon our lone rising molecule - gravity.With every second, gravity is decelerating our lone molecule by 9.8 m/s^2 (32.2 ft/s^2). So, we can calculate the height the molecule will reach:our initial velocity is 511 m/s (1676 ft/s) and our acceleration is -9.8 m/s^2 (-32.2 ft/s^2). That gives a height reached of 13,322.5 m (43,709 ft). Once our molecule reaches that height, its vertical velocity will be zero, and it will begin to fall.So, how fast would our molecule have to be traveling to escape? There is a concept called escape velocity that determines how fast an unpropelled object will travel with gravity as its decelerant. The idea being that the object will continually slow but gravity will continually weaken as the object gets farther away. At escape velocity, the speed will hit zero at distance infinity.G is the gravitational constant (6.67E-11), M is the mass of Earth (5.97E24), and r is the radius of Earth (6378100)That gives us an escape velocity of 11,179.365 m/s (36,677.7 ft/s).Now, remember that our molecule‚Äôs speed of around 511 m/s (1676 ft/s) was the average speed of a nitrogen molecule. Some nitrogen molecules are moving slower, which means some are moving faster. A small percentage may actually be moving at or above 11,179.365 m/s (36,677.7 ft/s) and could possible escape (although as we discussed earlier, they are likely to hit other molecules and transfer some of their kinetic energy to those molecules, and slow down).We've been talking about nitrogen, but it isn't the only gas in our atmosphere. There is an expression of kinetic temperature that can be derived from the ideal gas law:The kinetic energy is proportional to the temperature of the gas. So, if our volume of gas is at a certain temperature, molecules with less mass must have greater (average) velocity to compensate. That tells us that molecules less massive than nitrogen have an average speed greater than the average speed of nitrogen. Hydrogen, for example, has an average speed of 1930 m/s (6,332 ft/s). Still not fast enough for the average molecule to escape, but a small amount will be moving fast enough to escape. And in fact we see that. About 95,000 tons of hydrogen manage to escape our atmosphere each year. But don't get too worried, that's only 0.00000000000017% of the Earth's supply of hydrogen.This deceleration is caused by gas molecules moving away from the center of the Earth having to climb up through Earth‚Äôs gravity well. Gas molecules moving away from the ISS isn‚Äôt really comparable. The ISS doesn‚Äôt have a massive gravitational impact. There is nothing to decelerate the movement of a gas molecule away from the center of the ISS, except the walls of the ISS. Take those walls away and the molecules quickly disperse into low Earth orbit. Whether or not they leave low Earth orbit is dictated by the problem we just worked."
34,"So this is a listing of all the websites that I have found useful during planning my trips.http://Wikitravel.com - This is my travel bible. I literally 100's of pages of printouts from this website. Whenever I plan, the first website that I always visit is this. And it hardly every disappoints. Most of the travel locations in the world are listed here. And since it is crowd-sourced, people write the most meaningful information here, and it often sounds like a personal blog. You will find relevant information about how to get to a location, accommodation, eating options, things to do, things to see - everything on the same page. Under accommodation listings you will mostly find the 3 kinds of options - budget, mid-range, or splurge. Truly my bible for travel planning.http://Tripadvisor.com - The quintessential website for planning any trip. Probably the most exhaustive listing of places to visit, hotels, local attractions. Nobody ever plans a trip without going to this website at least once. http://Youtube.com - Porn is about the only thing you cannot find here. Travel logs, video logs, local culture - everything you need to know about where you are going can be found here. And its quite fascinating too to see so many videos about one place - so many different perspectives. I watched the whole documentary series by BBC on the Himalayas before leaving for Himachal. And it was quite an experience to see first-hand some of the stuff I had seen on video.Lonely Planet - This is my last resort website. They seem too high handed. And generally I have had a bad experience going to all those places that have been recommended by Lonely Planet.There are millions out there who run travel blogs and share their experiences. Its best to just google search and read through those blogs once before you leave. You might get to know some really cool volunteering opportunities, or a really hot and happening bar/pub generally not known to tourists. Have a safe journey. And please do carry your ID and a torchlight, always."

Not a lot, but enough for me to understand my thruput.Throughput = (time invested in researching for product ideas/niches + time running the dropshipping store) / the profit (revenue minus item costs)So for example, I‚Äôd spend time researching for a niche product to sell on ebay, let‚Äôs say, snow gloves, and then I‚Äôd create an ad on ebay to dropship the snow gloves that I found from Alibaba.Let‚Äôs assume the gloves go for $15 on Alibaba and I would charge 1.4x of the original cost, so 15 * 1.4 = 21 dollars.21 dollars minus ebay and paypal fees = 19 dollars.My net profit would be $4. I‚Äôd earn 4 dollars for every 21 dollars. That means my profit margin would be roughly 19%.Well, 19% is still not a bad profit margin. Just to give you a reference point, Apple‚Äôs products are around 38%.Gift Card ResellingI gave up on the business idea after 2 weeks. I found that this market was dominated by 3 big players with millions of funding.Airbnb Rental ArbitrageI‚Äôve been doing this for over a year now. My profit margin varies from month to month, but it averages from 42% to 58%.This all depends on occupancy rate and the time of the year. Most businesses struggle with above 20% margins.What is Airbnb Arbitrage?In this case, you are renting a property out at a lower price and subleasing it out via Airbnb at a higher price. For example, you lease a 1-bedroom apartment at $1,000 dollars a month and rent out the same 1-bedroom for $2,000 dollars a month on Airbnb. Your net profit is $1k a month.The more units you open up, the more cash flow you‚Äôll be able to generate.Best part about this business model is that you lease homes and not own them. Once the business is up and running, I spend only a few hours each week managing the business.Hope this helps!P.S. I teach other entrepreneurs how to build an Airbnb business on PassiveAirbnb.com"
37,"In dating I've always lived by this philosophy, ""There's a reason why rocket ships don't have rear view mirrors.""Relationships are hard (for many reasons) but they're made worse by some of the unnecessary stuff which people do, like saying ""I'm confused about my feelings"" What does that even mean? <--said totally rhetorically :)As hard as relationships are, I'm always one to say try to fix things BUT don't even try to fix a relationship with someone who leaves you for a pointless reason. You're a rocket ship - you're trying to reach the stars in romance, career and other things. Don't waste fuel slowing down and looping back to things which don't make sense. If your boss at work said, ""We're not really sure how we feel about you sitting at this desk? Why don't you stop coming to work from now on?"" Would you go home and wonder whether you should call your boss and ask if she's rethought her feelings about you at that desk? Probably not...But because you care about this girl you hope that you can make the same mistake and get a positive response. Sadly you won't - tell your rocket pilot to accelerate away - what you thought was a star, was just space debris. Best of luck. "
38,"Detailed Account of the UPSC Preparation from scratchI feel privileged today to share my two cents on civil services preparation. Before I begin let me clearly state that there is no magic wand to clear civil services. Also there is no correlation of intelligence and high aptitude with chances of selection in civil services. Most of the people who crack it are no indifferent (at one point of time even they were a part of the herd and felt the same uncertainty of clearing up this exam).But yes something worked for them, that made them successful.I would like to list down some of the most important components which you will find common in preparation of all successful candidates. We can call them as Basic Pillars of UPSC PreparationA timetable and strategy: Nothing is possible without proper planning, a daily timetable and short/long term goals setting. So plan and timetable is the first pillar.A strong foundation and conceptual clarity: it is important to ensure whatever we read, we understand it thoroughly. UPSC questions are very much applied, they need analysis and that can come only when we are crystal clear with our concepts of subject matter.Consolidation and revision: The syllabus is like a vast ocean, it is important to keep consolidating and revising it time and again. So make notes and continuously revise every now and then.Evaluation of Preparation: At every point of time you should know where your preparation stand, that is possible through self-evaluation and evaluation through tests.Consistency: Nothing happens without it. People who show consistency are sure shot to be rewarded, provided they work smartlyDiscussions and Answer writing: Discussions are very important, they will help in clearing your doubts & better understanding of subject matter. Similarly Answer writing has a very important role, knowledge without ability to express and articulate is futile. It is important to develop the ability to deliver in 8 minutes.Being Optimistic: This is the last but the most important one. UPSC is a time taking process, full of obstacles and failures. How to cope up with them, keeping yourself motivated is the biggest key to success.I will discuss each of the above point in detail sometime later. Also I shall take up discussion on soft aspects like right time to start preparation, should job be left, need of a backup, how do I decide why civil services etc. Clarity on all this is must before giving a full-fledged effort for preparation.Now let us discuss how to prepare for civil services.Pre ‚ÄìPreparation ModeThe initial two-three months are very confusing. People are generally not able to understand what to read, how to make notes, which newspaper to refer and other plethora of questions coming to their minds. What most people end up doing is they join a coaching thinking it to be a solution to all problems , others blindly start following some senior who himself is misdirected. This is a very crucial stage and I feel most of the people lose their momentum here because of a faulty start and they find very difficult to realign later.So starting has to be steady and sober. I think it is important to give at least two months to yourself to get yourself in UPSC mode. Start reading newspapers and noting them down, basic NCERT‚Äôs of economics, Polity & other basic ones, some good blogs/book etc. This will not only help in giving you a foundation but also help in taking informed decisions related to preparation (estimation of time you will need, need of coaching, should job be continued, optional choice etc.). This will act as a trial and error time where you can learn how to make notes, how to read books, learn from others etc. So this will make things smooth in your preparation be it self or through coaching.I shall discuss in detail how to go about in pre-preparation modePreparation ModeWhen you start your preparation, have..."
39,"There are a lot of good answers on this thread.¬† It's true that we learned a lot about variable-geometry wings, their weight and drag penalties, and their weird behavior in certain airspeed regimes as we evolved the F-111, the F-14 and the B-1.¬† However, some of the cited articles (and a lot more not cited) call out what's probably the strongest reason for abandoning this kind of design: software can adjust aerodynamic and flight control performance better than hardware can.¬† These days, we just don't need mechanical contrivances to make aircraft fly the way we want them to.As an aside, in the safety community, the impressive complexity of wing sweep systems always was accompanied by some hand-wringing about the possibility of an ""asymmetric wing sweep,"" where the wings don't mirror each other's position: See The story of F-14A, Aircraft No. 3, BuNo. 157982.¬† However, if memory serves, at best there might have been exactly one instance of this happening to an aircraft in service -- I think it was an F-14, and I'm confident that it got down safely.¬† (If anybody has back issues of the Naval Safety Center's Approach magazine, I think that's where I read about it many moons ago.)To my knowledge, neither an F-111 or a B-1 ever has encountered this kind of malfunction.¬† (That's probably a good thing.)"

42,"I day trade on the futures every day. My AIM is 1K per day which I usually do achieve at times I lose but most months I am over my AIM of 20K.

43,"No - kids are naturally curious and active, both physically and mentally. They are sponges, eager to learn all kinds of things about their world and life. Research suggests it is good for kids to have summer camps, cooking classes, chess classes, and all sorts of extracurricular activities. BUT, there is a limit. If you over schedule a kid with extracurricular activities, you could prevent them from learning what truly interests them. Not only that, they could feel as though you only love them for their accomplishments. A parent‚Äôs role is to prepare their child to take their place in society and make a meaningful contribution to their world. Therefore, I would submit that it‚Äôs not so much boredom as leisure time that is important. Leisure time is what allows kids and adults to daydream and get creative."
44,"If you are doing an engineering course, in NAAC-A or B Grade University, per se, it doesn't matter in the long-term perspective. However, on the short-term it does. The precise clarity is as follows:NAAC grade doesn't get endorsed in your certificate so it doesn't impact your further career. No one in the industry shall ever ask you whether you belonged to an Alma mater with A or B NAAC grade.Where it matters is that if you are studying in NAAC A, A+ or A++ Grade university, it is almost given that the institute does hold superior credentials and delivers high on academics as well as preparing students for the future. Industries do also recognize these top graded universities better than B grade universities and hence students placements become much easier. It also gives an instant confidence in students that the level of peers in the classroom, teachers, project support and infrastructure would be decidedly better than the NAAC B grade universities. In nutshell, it surely augurs well to be studying in the university that is awarded NAAC accreditation in ""A"" series."
45,"So, now we know what we are looking for in our Instagram followers, let‚Äôs have a chat about how to get them.DO NOT BUY Followers!!First of all, at some point your real fans will begin to notice and your credibility will be shot for good. Second of all, fake accounts don‚Äôt engage with your content, they just sit there, taking up space. This means that the algorithms used by social media to determine what is popular and what isn‚Äôt will see your account with its thousands of followers and little to interaction and will determine that your content is not engaging. This will lead to your content being put to the bottom of the pile with little chance of reaching featured status.So, How Then?Big no-no for building your Instagram following, but we are here to talk about the right way to do things. Here are some legitimate and non-spammy ways to build your profile‚Äôs popularity.1. The first thing you need to do is choose a focus for your account and avoid anything irrelevant to that focus.2. If your account is to promote your business then try to avoid pictures of your lunch or you hanging out with friends. 3. Then you want to make your account look good, with your focus in mind.4. An interesting description and profile picture will help, but what you really want to focus on is your photo feed.5. Around twenty photos that match your focus is a good place to start.6. If you are using Instagram for business then don‚Äôt make every picture a promotion or advertisement or you will put people off right away. 7. Take and post some beautiful pictures that are relevant to your field. For example, if you run an outdoors activity shop, take some photos of the scenery next time you are out for a walk and put those up.8. Delete old photos if necessary and adopt a quality over quantity mantra.9. On the subject of quantity, take care with how many photos you upload at once. People can get annoyed if the accounts that they follow are too prolific. 10. You want to post regularly, but never batch-upload. A good rule of thumb is no more than a single photo within a six hour period. More than this and your followers will feel like you are spamming them and may unfollow you.11. If people comment positively on your photos then be sure to thank them. Just a single word response will make them feel like their comment is appreciated and that you are more than just a passive poster. 12. Similarly, you should interact with the people that you follow. If you see a photo that you like, don‚Äôt just say ‚Äúnice pic‚Äù or something generic like that. Instead try to say something meaningful about why you like the picture. The followers of the person you are commenting on will be more likely to check you out if you do.13. Use your other networks and channels to promote your Instagram. Due to it being owned by the same company, the network interacts very well with Facebook and you should use this to your advantage. Consider adding a feed of your photos to your blog as well. Do you use Instagram? If so, what are your top tips for gaining and keeping engaged followers? Please let me know in the comments."
46,"Thank you, Nathan Arbeh, for asking me.All of the other answers on this subject are correct and well-taken. I add mine with more freighted language because I disagree with the path Quora is taking, and I will candidly frame it in those terms. Quora wants to force questions and answers into specific templates whether questioners or answerers like it or not. The sorts of Q&A that will be affected least by this are hard science questions. Anything that involves more humanistic concepts becomes, inherently, devalued. People will continue to applaud exemplary first person narratives, but only for their crowd-pleasing drama or humor, not for the subtextual conclusions that could be drawn from a broader understanding of how people relate. Hard science fits nicely into pre-sized boxes. Questions can be succinct, answers too. But there is less tolerance for people really trying to understand their existences and their personal worlds. I've seen many on Quora express frustration over the recurrence of such personal questions, but I see them as valid expressions, each as different as a snowflake, of the human condition. As such, I think Quora is moving the same direction as most mass media, towards sound bites, and quick satisfaction. In my view, the arts (and empathy) will suffer. I take no joy in penning my bummer answer. Sorry!"

49,"Having been through very deep depression for over a decade in my life l understand how you feel. I didn't think I would ever have friends in my life for years but I learned some things I'd like to share with you as my life is completely different now and people look to me to teach them communication and how to build rapport.There are lots of great answers to your question so I'll try to give you new suggestions.Here's a basic fact...People want to be happy and are attracted to people and activities that make them happier.Notice how true that is in your own life.Being attractive to people (not physically but emotionally) is the key.Here are my suggestions...Become great at asking questions to get people to talk. We all love to talk about ourselves but that's the problem in life, we want to talk not listen. Therefore becoming great at listening by becoming great at asking questions is a valuable skill. A long time ago I learned an acronym that had been super successful at helping me build rapport with strangers to start to meet people to make friends easily. FORM. I use FORM as a structure to ask questions. F stands for family, so sample questions are, are you married, how long for? Do you have kids? O stands for occupation so questions are like, what do you do for a living? How long have you worked there? R stands for recreation, so questions are like, what do you like to do when you're not working, do you have any hobbies? And M stands for money. Questions relating to money can be, are you happy with how much you're making, do you invest in shares or property, which one do you think is best? I can have a conversation with a stranger for an hour with these questions because people love to talk if someone genuinely cares enough to listen. Try this out and you'll be amazed at how easy it is to talk to people.Focus on improving your own level of happiness. Happiness is our natural state of mind that comes about if we don't get caught up in our emotions, feelings and negative thoughts. We're like a cork under water that always wants to float to the surface. It's our dwelling on the past that pulls us down or 'anchors' to negative events in our past that prevent our natural happiness from rising to the surface. Letting go of the negative thoughts as soon as they come into the mind is the key. Becoming conscious of thoughts that turn into feelings that make us feel bad is the beginning of avoiding them. Letting go is an awesome and powerful concept and asking yourself does it really matter with things that bother you helps you to clear the energy of these thoughts and events as they come up.Stop resisting feeling happy and loving. Often we train ourselves to resist feeling happy and loving because we feel we have no right to. It's the complete opposite in fact. We should be happy and loving no matter what because the state of mind we get into determines if we are going to suffer or transcend the situation or not. When we're in a happy or loving state of mind our brains think more positively about solutions. When we're unhappy it perpetuates and we can't solve the problems we are experiencing. Happiness is a state of mind we have to choose dozens or hundreds of times. It's not easy but slowly over time you'll get better by letting go and choosing happiness.Practice making positive comments. Set a goal to pay someone a compliment every day. After achieving the goal practice giving five in a day. Something magical will happen from this. You'll become happier!Learn about yourself. This is the key to happiness. I recommend having your DISC Profile assessment as the principle of the four profiles was identified over two thousand years ago so it's not new and very established. I believe this is the most beneficial subject there is to learn in life! Your ability to be happy has everything to do with how well you understand and get along with people and DISC Profiles provide enormous insight into how to get along with the 75% of people who aren't your DISC Profile.Learn about introverts, extroverts and ambiverts. It helps you to relate and communicate with people who aren't like you.Forgive people. Forgiving people makes you happier because it takes away your feeling you need to judge, punish or condemn people and let the world take care of them with rewards or punishment, which is called karma. Letting people have their own karma frees up the negative energy associated with guilt you think others should feel. And lastly forgive yourself. Often people suffer and struggle in life because of some ""program"" running inside them if guilt or shame so they punish themselves for it and wallow in misery. Letting go of all that crap is the key to happiness.Here's a video intro to DISC Profiles you may enjoy that I made..."

52,"A LOT of mathematics is involved.A Propeller Acts Like a WingA propeller is not a screw, but acts like an airfoil or wing generating lift with a forward component giving thrust, but also a transversal angular component from lift and drag requiring torsion of the propeller axis.If you understand how an airfoil or wing works, which is also how a sail works in sailing against the wind, you can understand how a propeller works.The blade of a propeller acts like a wing, which is inclined with a pitch angle to a plane of rotation and with a certain angle of attack aoa to the apparent direction of the incoming flow (relative wind), which depends on the rotational velocity of the propeller and the forward speed. Increasing the rotational velocity with the same pitch, increases the aoa and increasing the forward speed decreases the aoa. A propeller blade acting like a wing gives lift L counted perpendicular to the incoming flow and drag D in the direction of the incoming flow as indicated in the figure below. The component of L in the forward direction (minus a component from drag D) gives thrust. The transversal components of L and D create torsion on the propeller axis which needs to be balanced. The lift/drag ratio L/D is crucial for the performance of the propeller, since L is crucial for thrust and D for turbulent losses. For a symmetric wing L/D = 10-20 for normal aoa = 3-15, with however only L/D = 3 at maximal lift for aoa = 20, as discussed below.Lift and Drag of a WingMechanismBelow we give a shortcut to the action of wing, with the flow seen as perturbation of zero lift/drag potential flow arising from a mechanism of instability at rear separation, which modifies the pressure distribution so as to give both lift and drag. Notice that large lift comes from suction on the leeward surface resulting from the fact the flow does not separate on the crest. This is because the fluid (air or water) has very small viscosity which means that the boundary layer is turbulent with small skin friction closely approximated by the slip boundary condition of potential flow. Viscous flow with laminar boundary layer separates on the crest and gives poor lift.Why a Propeller Gives ThrustA relatively simple method of predicting the performance of a propeller (as well as fans or windmills) is the use of Blade Element Theory. In this method the propeller is divided into a number of independent sections along the length. At each section a force balance is applied involving 2D section lift and drag with the thrust and torque produced the section. At the same time a balance of axial and angular momentum is applied. This produces a set of non-linear equations that can be solved by iteration for each blade section. The resulting values of section thrust and torque can be summed to predict the overall performance of the propeller.Aerodynamics for StudentsJust a couple of years ago they were about to close the doors on the facility that makes the ATR line of turboprop regional airliners. Total orders for the ATR 42 and 72 made by the European consortium had dropped to six, and no new customers were on the horizon. The regional jets (RJs) had won, and the era of the turboprop was over, again.But a funny thing happened on the way to the funeral for the propeller. Oil prices skyrocketed, the financial performance of the world's airlines crashed, and suddenly airlines needed a more efficient and cost-effective way to move passengers over distances of several hundred miles.Now, ATR has nearly 300 orders from airlines all over the world for its highwing turboprop twins and it is doing its best to ramp up production. The same is true in Canada where Bombardier builds its ""Dash"" series of turboprop airliners derived from the de Havilland line. The turboprop is back.For at least 30 years aviation - both airline and business flying - has been announcing the end of..."
53,"The best food I have eaten is a very specific type of Idly called Mallige Idly. By this sentence most Indians will know that I am a south Indian. Anyway, almost a month back, there was a war going on twitter. Gordon Ramsay v/s South Indians. Just because he said our every day food which is Idly and vada looked like prison food for him.. Frankly speaking, it hurt me.. Because I am no prisoner and the food I eat is in fact so healthy that many hospitals serve them on a daily basis to its patients and many doctors recommend this to be consumed on a daily basis as it causes zero affect on health. But, I am least bothered as I know what Idly is made of and how tasty it is and he is the one who is at loss as he will never be able to taste what we taste.Moving on let me describe how this became my favorite food.. As long as i remember, my mom used to make terrible Idlies.. They were full of rava and i hated it (sorry mom). So I could hardly eat idly. But, it was twice a week mandatory breakfast at our place.. we had to eat it as breakfast and then take it to school for lunch.. But, at school i would eat other‚Äôs lunch to satisfy my taste buds..I am from Mysore, so the famous festival Dasara gives us a lot of opportunity to have variety of food.. There will be fair and exhibits of lot of stuff which can be bought and also lot of tasty food.. Its called ‚ÄúMysuru Dasara exhibition‚Äù.We used to go there every year as there will be lot of games to play for children (which I wanted to to back then). When I was 9 or 10 years old we were walking in the exhibition, looking around for something exciting to eat with my mom and my brother.. My mom saw that there is a stall of ‚ÄúMysore Mallige Idly‚Äù. So she took us there. She ordered 2 plates of Mallige Idly. One for her and me and one more for my elder brother.. As I used to waste a lot of food back then, she wanted me to taste it first..Maillige idly usually will be served with 2 or 3 types of chutney as shown in the below photo.But, the size and shape of the mallige idly was not like the one in the photo. Just to give you a rough idea.. Have a look at the below picture which shows the thickness of a idly.But, a mallige idly will be 1.5 times thicker that the one in the picture. A lot softer, in fact it will be so soft few people call it sponge idly.. literally it will be like a sponge if to try squeezing it.. but it will not be chewey at all.. it will just melt in the mouth..So, continuing the story. My mom smeared some red chutney and some green chutney and a broken piece of Mallige idly and gave it to me for tasting.. Just for me to decide, if I wanted it or not.. I just put it in my mouth and the flavours of red chilly, ginger, garlic, coconut, coriander, curry leaves, Roasted gram (Hurigadale), with occasional encounter of muster seeds, along with all these the the soft soft mallige idly started bursting in my mouth.. It just melted like butter in my mouth.. I felt like i just visited heaven..I had never tasted anything like that before.. So, i ended up eating 3 or 4 plates of mallige idly that day.. My mom had to call it a day and drag me out of that place..Since then, my mom kept trying and trying to make those idlies. But, till date she hasn‚Äôt been successful.. But, the idly of hers has improved a lot.. now i like my mom‚Äôs idlies..But, after that, over the period of several years, I have tried Mallige idlies at several places none of them were like the one that i ate that day.. I used to hunt for Mallige idlies in and around mysore but, dint find anything even close to that.. One of my uncle said there is one place near pandavapura (Mandya district) where, in a small house one old man prepares mini idlies which tastes similar to mallige idly.. Immediately I told my dad (he is my partner for all kinds of food exploration, we always keep each other updated on ‚ÄúNew good places to eat in Mysore‚Äù he is a big time foodie) that we should go there.. so the next day morning we left mysore by 6 am rode on a two wheeler for almost 40 kms (approx) for few plates of Idly.. But, trust me it was worth it.. we enjoyed the journey and the food was amazing (Not a mallige idly. But, fantastic idlies) I would have eaten 3 -4 plates there too..So there it is the best food ever eaten..P.S: I am still searching on the Dasara Exhibitions every year to find that perfect mallige idly. So far I have not been successful.. Anyone knows any place in Bangalore or Mysore which serves awesome mallige idly.. Please let me know.. A hungry soul is waiting to be satisfied."

Not entirely sure what the process looks like for foreign or DOD students, but I‚Äôm pretty sure that my roommate at RSI was at least a year older than me (he was from Poland).You should check each program individually; they likely vary on a case-by-case basis, but in general, I would think that for the really top tier prestigious summer camps (RSI, HSHSP, etc.) you apply your junior year and go there junior summer."
56,"I was the other woman in a relationship like the one you are describing. I was in a bad place in my own life, a sad place. A guy came along who I found attractive because he was extremely nice to me and had a way of looking at me and speaking to me like I was the most important person in the world. When we first started talking, I didn't know he had a girlfriend. After he and I had started doing some pretty heavy talking, which was about 3 months after we first met, I asked him if he had a girlfriend. He said that yes, he did...a girl who he lived with, who had a grade-school-aged son from a previous relationship. He had been with his girlfriend for over 5 years. I asked him why he didn't tell me about his girlfriend in the beginning, and his answer to me was, ""Because you never asked."" I should have walked away then and there, but by then I was too addicted to the attention he was giving me. ¬†We eventually ended up sleeping together, and we continued to do so for 8 months. He complained about his girlfriend, how she did this wrong and that wrong, how she didn't satisfy him sexually, how her son was a brat, etc. When they moved out of the place they were renting to move into a bigger place (also a rental, and a beautiful, recently built home), he insisted that he was laying the groundwork to get rid of his girlfriend and begin a life with me. Looking back now, I cannot believe how stupid I was. It seemed like every time he opened his mouth, more lies came out, but he was able to convince me that he loved me and that even though things LOOKED one way, they were completely different in actuality...meaning that even though it LOOKED like he and his girlfriend were having a good time, going to fancy parties with their wealthy friends and moving into a gorgeous new home, he was actually miserable and couldn't wait for the day that we could be together. Even though it SEEMED like I was only getting scraps of his time, I was actually the one getting the QUALITY time because he was just so miserable with his girlfriend, the sex was terrible, etc. Oh, did I forget to mention that? He was still having sex with her when he was having sex with me, but told me not to worry about it, because he didn't enjoy the sex with her AT ALL. I know...it was as though I didn't have a brain in my head. I let myself get sucked in, and once he had me, he manipulated me, and I wanted so badly to believe that he loved me that I rationalized everything he did and said. His girlfriend never knew about me. Here was a person who loved him, whose life was being played with. Completely unfair to her, and to say I am ashamed of the role I played in all of it is the understatement of the year.¬†I ended up getting my wish about 8 months after I started sleeping with him. He got rid of his girlfriend and began a relationship with me. Everything seemed to go okay at first, but then a couple of his friends, whose opinions meant everything to him, told him that they liked the other girl much better than they liked me. They also told him that they didn't find me attractive, and after that, he began treating me like crap. I don't think it helped that his friends knew he had been seeing me behind his girlfriend's back. He eventually went back to the other girl, and then they broke up again, and he ended up marrying someone else on a whim about 6 months after that. To be honest, even before his friends told him they didn't care for me, there seemed to be a dark cloud of shame over everything we did after we were able to be a ""real"" couple, meaning after he had broken it off with his girlfriend and we didn't have to sneak around anymore. ¬†I made the mistake of thinking that we were having a real relationship while he was still with his girlfriend and I was the girl on the side. We really weren't having a real relationship when we were sneaking around behind his girlfriend's back. You can't ever have a real relationship with someone who is unavailable. ¬†I was completely crushed by the entire experience. I deserved everything I got, and more...and believe me when I tell you that it took a very, very long time...years...for my life to get back to normal. I will say again that I deserved everything that happened to me as a result of my involvement with him. I am sure it was a combination of low self esteem and my vulnerable state due to all of the unpleasant things that were happening in my own life, that caused me to get sucked in by a person like him.This man also had a history of staying with a woman for 5 years, then cheating on her and finding someone else, and then staying with the new woman for 5 years. I was so blind and so hooked on the way he made me feel that I believed him when he said he was sure that this time (meaning with me) would be different. Well, it was actually different, but that was because my involvement with him lasted for only a year, as opposed to his usual 5 years with other women. Why I thought I was any different or more special than any of the other women is beyond me...but I will make a guess and say that it probably had something to do with the many, many lies he was telling me to keep me around, to serve his purpose of having his cake and eating it too. So many red flags, and I just couldn't, or perhaps wouldn't, see them. Oh, and I should add that I never used to think much about track records...I was just so optimistic, I guess, that I figured that just because something didn't work five times, the sixth time it just might work out. Very foolish thinking. I now pay close attention to track records.I almost forgot to add that during our not real relationship, after he had moved into the new, beautiful house with his girlfriend, I must have somewhat regained part of my sanity, because I told him that maybe we should stop contacting each other for a while so that he could explore his relationship with his girlfriend, and see if maybe he still loved her down deep. His response was an immediate, ""No. I don't want to stop talking with you."" So, like the willfully blind idiot that I had become, I continued seeing him. I have already written a lot here, and there are many twists and turns to the story, so in the interest of keeping it a little shorter, I won't go into more detail...but I want you to believe me when I say that my involvement with this man nearly ruined my life. ¬†Please walk away from this man you are involved with. He does not sound like an honorable man at all. I am telling you from experience that when you begin a relationship based on dishonesty, you will have more problems than you can count, and karma has a way of catching up with you."

62,"Oh gosh, NO.Aside, from the fact that the ‚Äúbook‚Äù itself was more of a play manuscript than an actual novel, which made reading harder to digest, there were so many uses bad of storytelling, character inconsistencies and themes which honestly made the book a headache to read.Now, before I tear this book to shreds, there were some good things that I‚Äôd like to say about Harry Potter and The Cursed Child.SPOILERs but hey this book‚Äôs not worth reading yet anyway.Good Things:Up until they introduced the time-travelling plot device, I thought the storyline was actually going smoothly. I liked how they introduced Harry Potter‚Äôs kid, Albus Severus, as this student who‚Äôs constantly living under his father‚Äôs shadow and that unlike Harry, he‚Äôs never had any fun or memorable adventures before the inciting incident, thus he‚Äôs always looked down upon by everyone else for not living up to his father‚Äôs guise.The fact that he was placed in Slytherin instead of Gryffindor would have really made for some really good conflict. I actually liked the fact that he was placed in Slytherin instead of Gryffindor. It would have been interesting to see the majority of the kids in Gryffindor as the antagonists of the story, something fresh and new and a complete role reversal from the previous books. We‚Äôd be able to see that not all the kids in Slytherin are mean, evil bullies but can actually be decent people. But sadly, this theme was not fully explored.Bad thingsMaking Harry Potter into this asshole character. I understand characters develop over time but I thought this version of Harry deviated too much from the one in the previous books. In the previous books, Harry was this brave, selfless yet impulsive guy who‚Äôs willing to risk his life to save his friends. In this book, he asks Albus to sever his friendship to Scorpius, one of the few friends he has in Hogwarts, and he even yelled at him saying that he wish he didn‚Äôt have a son like him. I thought Harry was a little too unlikeable and someone who‚Äôs far different than what he was in the books.Hermione‚Äôs dark future. There was this alternate timeline in which Hermione became this bitter, angry Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher after she lost Ron and that‚Äôs not what Hermione is like! She‚Äôs logical, smart, calm and not the kind of character who would have let her future and actions be defined by a guy. Its basically saying Hermione is dependent on Ron for her happiness and Hermione is too strong and independent of a character who would let a guy dictate her choices.Bellatrix and Voldemort. In the previous books, Voldemort has been established as this cold, calculating villain who doesn‚Äôt care about anyone but himself. The fact that he did it with Bellatrix is about as plausible as discovering a sugar cube on Mars, it doesn‚Äôt fit with his character at all. It just made for a bunch of character inconsistencies and derailed his personality. It‚Äôs like the author was playing a game of darts and decided to randomly assign a ‚Äúshocking‚Äù event just to make another useless plot twist.The Whole time-travelling plot. Time-travelling is one of the trickier plot devices to put in any medium, wether it be a book or a movie. In my opinion, a story should not revolve around time-travelling, as it‚Äôs a device best used for a one-off story element. Time travelling worked in Prisoner of Azkaban as it‚Äôs not focused throughout the whole book, since the story relied on elements of mystery to make the story flow. Questions like: Who is Sirius Black? How did Voldemort find Harry‚Äôs parents? Who is Peter Pettigrew? These questions keep the reader interested and push the story through. I don‚Äôt think Cursed Child has any of those elements and it‚Äôs just a bad Harry Potter fan fic of these kids moving to fan fic A, then going to fan fic B and then going to fan fic C.Wasted Potential. There was so much wasted potential in this boo..."
63,"Humans react to darkness in much the same way. Some to even a greater extent like you, it could be what darkness represents that triggers your depression. Dark is the opposite of bright or positive. Depressed people often dress in dark gloomy colors indicative of their mood. Though you are opposed to uv light therapy the more light you leave on in the house the better. There is a seasonal affective component to depression that is not just light related, it's dark related. Plus the weather prevents a lot of activity which may help with depression. Depression in the evening should react to the same treatment for depression in general. Look into cognitive therapies by Albert Ellis for treatments,"

67,"Benjamin Franklin hypothesized that lightning is an electrical phenomenon, and that the electrical effect of lightning might be transferable to another object and cause an effect that could be recognized as electricity. He did a famous Kite experiment to prove this hypothesis.In 1752 in Philadelphia Ben Franklin decided did this experiment. With the help of his son, William, he attached his kite to a silk string, tying an iron key at the other end. Next, they tied a thin metal wire from the key and inserted the wire into a leyden Jar , a container for storing an electrical charge. Leyden Jar is shown belowFinally, as the sky darkened and a thunderstorm approached, they attached a silk ribbon to the key. Holding onto the kite by the silk ribbon, Ben flew the kite and once it was aloft, he retreated into a barn so that he would not get wet. The thunder storm cloud passed over Franklin's kite, whereupon the negative charges in the cloud passed onto his kite, down the wet silk string, to the key, and into the jar. Ben however, was unaffected by the negative charges because he was holding the dry silk ribbon, insulating him from the charges on the key. When he moved his free hand near the iron key, he received a shock. Why? Because the negative charges in the key were so strongly attracted to the positive charges in his body, a spark jumped from the key to his hand. Franklin's experiment successfully showed that lightning was static electricity. One can experience this same reaction while rubbing feet on a carpet and then touching the metal doorknob.Ben was lucky to survived this dangerous experiment as many who performed this same kite experiment were electrocuted.This was one of experiment that was done to display the electrical energy stored in lightening. I am hopeful that the day will come when lightening will be harnessed for generating electrical energy to meet our energy needsSource of content and pictures : internet and Google images"
68,"‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖA2AI am assuming that you are new to performance testing (PT) and need to know how it is to work as a performance tester. I may stray into Performance Engineering (PE) while answering which is the superset of PT involving root-cause analysis and fixing the issues. I am not an authority and whatever I am answering is based upon a little experience I happen to have. Here are the different viewpoints:Career Prospects: Let me be very Frank ‚Äì there are not a lot of companies who would want their product to go through performance evaluation, there are several reasons for it.Number one reason is the lack of vision. Many managers or even the product owners do not have the vision of how a performance evaluation may help them in future. They are just eager to push the damn thing to production where it can start serving rather than having a product with good all-around quality.The application has too few users.Deciding against PT due to the high cost it carries mainly because of expensive tools and workforce.Having said that and going by the rules of the nature, as the demand is less the supply is also low. You would see very few people opting it as this is a specialized service.Even the companies like TCS, Infosys etc. which have a workforce running into hundred thousands have just a few hundred performance testers.‚ÄòGood‚Äô performance testers are even fewer.¬†What makes you a good performance tester?The qualities are, but not limited to the following:To be able to ‚Äòsize‚Äô the load. It‚Äôs a huge topic whose details can be found via any search engineTo be able to ‚Äòscript‚Äô using a wide range of tools including commercial tools as well as open source.Expert on various operating systems like Windows, Red Hat etc.Knows shell scriptingTo be able to analyze the results and identify the problemTo be able to find the root cause of the problem which is called the bottle neckGood in SQL, knows the architecture and how DBMS works at grass root level.Excellent is networking conceptsQuick learnerHas an eye for detailExcellent communicator Learning CurveAs evident from the list of skills you need ‚Äì the learning curve is a little steep. It‚Äôs not something you learn quickly. Some of the things need training while majority of things can only be learnt by experience. I cannot stress enough on the number of tools you are expected to have ‚Äòexpertise‚Äô on. New things are introduced all the time and you have to keep yourself updated all the time. This holds true for almost all IT related skills.¬†Work-Life BalanceYour usual day will be as it is for others in the software industry, especially in India, which means having little to no social life in the weekdays. The only silver lining is that your work will never get monotonous.Most clients would not want you to choke their resources in usual business hours so be prepared for off-hours execution.Usually senior testers are required to travel a lot.¬†What Next?You could start from learning a tool of your choice as people consider that as an entry criteria to get into PT. Later on ‚Äì you could look to acquire more skills and eventually graduate to a more advance level of PE. There are ample opportunities around the world. A lot of people also get into freelance or consulting roles.¬†Things to RememberOnly get into PT if it is something you really want to do. No because you ‚Äòcan‚Äô do or ‚Äòshould‚Äô do.Once you decide to get into it, give it everything. It needs a lot of hard work to perfect ‚Äì like every other skill but even the skills required to ‚Äòjust get the work done‚Äô are not easy to acquire.Few people would underestimate your work saying ‚Äúrecord aur play hi karna hai ji‚Äù (you just need to record and play) whereas recording and playing takes just 10 to 15% of the effort. Forgive and ForgetMost people will not understand what you do including your project managerProjects are short term and usually get over in 2-3 months.Let me know if you want me to add more."

70,"Not a silly question at all, especially if we bypass the ""eat"" part and ask why just, say, injecting a fish cell into our arm wouldn't turn us into a fish, or why giving our kid a transfusion of mongoose blood wouldn't turn him into a speedy superpowered whizzer.There are two parts to the answer.¬† First, DNA needs to have an elaborate support system before it can do anything.¬† It needs to be in a nucleus, wrapped in histones and other proteins, with access to polymerases and other enzymes, and so on and so on.¬† Just shoving DNA into your bloodstream doesn't give it access to those things, so it can't take over your cells to make fish or mongoose type proteins.(But if you add to the DNA a system for entering a new cell and taking over the built-in systems, then you have a virus, which essentially does exactly that -- turns your cells into a system for making more viruses.)But why not a whole cell? Why can't a fish cell settle down comfortably into our body and just pump out fish proteins all day long?The answer is the immune system, which is aimed at identifying things that are not ""self"" -- that is, that don't match the template of our own cells -- and to attack and reject them.¬† The immune system is very good at that, and can even reject very similar cells, like those of a different human, so identifying a fish or a mongoose cell is very easy to do, and those cells would be very quickly attacked and destroyed.(Today, the immune system is tuned for identifying and destroying bacteria and viruses and so on.¬† But it's possible that hundreds of millions of years ago, much of the immune system was tuned for exactly what we're talking about here -- preventing foreign cells from moving into the friendly environment and taking over.)"
71,"They are few but they exist..and its sheer bad luck if you meet someone with NPD for friendship, work or relationship...Initially he will be extremely charming, you fall for his witty attitude, intelligence, appearance, sexiness, grand clothing, powerful English talks..he will call you often, keep texting you..and there you fall in the trap..Then he tries to become your friend..you start hanging out, watch movies, eat lunch together..but always you need to pay, he is very stingy even though he would earn much more than you..but you never mind as you are deeply in love with this person, feel connected like soul mates so you keep ignoring all warning signsAppearance -he is preoccupied with his looks, hair, clothes and constantly seeks attention and needs compliments and you keep giving them as you are in love..He is usually a meterosexual man who does his eyebrows, waxes his hands and legs (how gayish) wears trendy loud clothes with a sense of extreme pride..goes to expensive spas and salons more often than ladies..wears only branded apparel and mocks people who live simple life..

72,"Your question consists of two parts:one is how to speak confidently and another is how to speak fluently.Let me make it short for you.First of all confident comes when you feel that you are perfect in speaking English and that feeling will not come overnight.simple answer is that you need to work hard.This working hard nature develops only if you are in very high need of English.I mean it is not as easy as asking question in quora.Here I suggest you that don‚Äôt simply say I want to learn English,instead do something for accomplishing it.The following are the things that you should do to speak confidently:Initially,start speaking in English with your inner conscience.You will never succeed if you don‚Äôt take any bold step.Believe me completely.You are going to win over this challenge if you start immediately.I saw many people who take many suggestions but never implement when time arrives.I request you to follow strictly.Now the second thing is use the IELTS application which enables you to speak with strangers.NOTE:Speak only with a motto to develop English in that very app.Don‚Äôt waste time in speaking unnecessary things with those who speak dirty words.Just hang up if you come across them.SUGGESTION:Don‚Äôt expect results immediately.Go on following things for a period of time. On one particular day you will find the results.For some it may take 5 months;for some it may be 1 year. It all depends on how often you practice it.Finally,your confidence levels depends on how much you practices daily either speaking with inner conscience or in IELTS.You know,indirectly speaking English confidently and fluently depends even on how much you suffer daily,because of lack of speaking English skills.This is because every time you suffer, your wish for speaking English increase gradually.Try to create strong necessity for learning English.Coming to next part of question how to speak fluently?Many people fail to speak fluently because of lack of words.Yes,it is because of lack of words.Let me break the phrase.Lack of words means people don‚Äôt have exact words to be used at that instance.People fail to express their views because of the same reason.Let me put forward few more tips to be followed:You need to have lots of words in your mind in order to express your views freely.All you need to do is to watch a lot of English movies with subtitles initially,read English News Papers daily and the most importantly inculcate the habit of thinking in English.Do every possible thing to improve your vocabulary as it helps you to use exact words in times of need with out saying aaaaa for longer period while speaking..Last and final thing is that imitate the accent of the speakers who speaks fluently.This will helps you in the course of time to speak fluently.I think this would help you.Please follow the suggestions without any delay.Thank you.Best of Luck!"

74,"I would agree with David Friedman that if the objective is to become a wealthy gambler the best strategy is to start out wealthy. But if you don‚Äôt have that luxury, the coolest story I know is that of Chris Ferguson. Described in an old New Yorker article as ‚Äútall and lanky, with very long brown hair and a brown goatee; his admirers call him Jesus.‚Äù Abridged version follows (and if the abridged version is too long; bold text tells the story):Ferguson was born in Los Angeles in 1963. His mother, Beatriz, was a mathematician and his father, Tom, taught game theory at U.C.L.A. Tom Ferguson brought home specialized board games and card games and taught them to Chris and his older brother, Marc, who is now a computer programmer. ‚ÄúWhenever there was a rainy day, we would get to stay inside and play Risk,‚Äù Tom Ferguson told me. His younger son ‚Äúlearned to think about playing and strategies and what other people know about what you know. It‚Äôs not important in chess, but it‚Äôs important in poker. It‚Äôs a rather deep game, when you get involved.‚Äù‚Ä¶At seventeen, accompanied by some of them, he began making occasional trips to Las Vegas. He and his friends would pool gas money, sleep in cheap hotels, and eat at the buffets. He liked Vegas because the people in the casinos called him ‚Äúsir,‚Äù and ‚Äúyou could lean back in your chair and no one would yell at you, unlike school.‚Äù His friends went for fun, but Ferguson went to establish whether he played poker well. ‚ÄúI saw Vegas as a challenge,‚Äù he told me. ‚ÄúPlay ten hours a day, pay for my room and my food, and get home with more money than I started with. I think of that as my transition into manhood‚Äîwhen I was able to prove to myself that if I had no support from my family, and no job, as long as I could get to Vegas, and have a hundred dollars in my pocket, I could survive.‚Äù‚Ä¶As an undergraduate, at U.C.L.A., Ferguson thought that joining the swing-dance club would be a good way to meet people, and now he is an expert dancer. He met his girlfriend, a Brazilian woman named Fabiola Gomes, at a night club. Gomes, a personal trainer, is petite and animated, with thick ringlets of dark hair. They live in her house in Las Vegas. Until two years ago, Ferguson, who is forty-five, lived mostly with his parents.‚Ä¶His thesis adviser was Leonard Kleinrock, whose lab sent what was considered the first message over the Internet, in 1969. Kleinrock told me that Ferguson was ‚Äúone of the more brilliant and creative young men that I‚Äôve known in my career at U.C.L.A.‚Äù During the late eighties, Ferguson was working as a programmer for a more advanced doctoral candidate when the student got a result he couldn‚Äôt interpret. ‚ÄúChris, this lowly programmer, writing code, explained what was causing the result,‚Äù Kleinrock said. ‚ÄúIt was a very deep theoretical idea, and his manner was very low-key, no bravado, just pure intelligence, and, when I saw that, I thought, I want to follow through with this guy.‚Äù‚Ä¶Ferguson moved out of his parents‚Äô house in California when he became really rich. (Nevada has no income tax.) He has won more than seven million dollars playing poker, and that‚Äôs still less, apparently, than what he has earned as ‚Äúsomething like chairman of the board‚Äù of Tiltware, which developed and licensed the software for Supergame, where people play poker, sometimes against Ferguson and other professionals, for money. In 2002, dissatisfied with the customer service of the online poker sites he visited, he saw the opportunity for a site ‚Äúfor the player, by the player, and of the player,‚Äù and began writing software for it. Supergame began operations two years later. Ferguson and a dozen other pro players involved with the site are known as Team Full Tilt.Initially, Full Tilt represented a novelty‚Äîother sites had pro players affiliated with them, but usually only one or two, and they weren‚Äôt necessarily available to play hands with customers. ‚ÄúIt grew about three per cent a week for the first year, and two per cent a week for the two years after, and suddenly you realize you‚Äôre there,‚Äù Ferguson said. According to H2 Gambling Capital, a gaming consultancy, the online poker business made $3.8 billion last year. The largest site is Play Poker Games at PokerStars, which is based on the Isle of Man. Supergame is the second largest, and one of the fastest growing. It has a sister site, Play online poker at Full Tilt, where only play money is used. Being rich, Ferguson said, makes his attention less acute, but his judgment more reliable. ‚ÄúYour judgment can be skewed if you‚Äôre desperate,‚Äù he said.As for the second part of your question, it appears to require brilliance and luck in massive doses. But I only have one story to go off of‚Ä¶Full article: What Would Jesus Bet? - The New Yorker (A lot of great detail not posted above.)Photograph by Martin Schoeller (taken from article)."
75,"I guess this answer may be incorrect. I had always thought it was correct, but it seems that many guns do not Fire bullets at the speed of sound. It also appears that the sound may be more from the propellant igniting. Most guns fire bullets faster than the speed of sound. This is the reason for the sound of a gunshot. The sound of a gunshot is mostly from the sonic boom created by the bullet. Many things in daily life create a sonic boom. A whip or even a towel snapping creates a sonic boom. If you have a dish of black powder and you ignite it, there is no sonic boom. So the explosion that fires the gun does not make the sound of a gunshot. It is the bullet reaching the speed of sound that does this. Pellet guns or BB guns do not Fire pellets or BBs faster than the speed of sound. Almost all other guns do though."
76,"Breast cancer is a preventable cancer. Research and studies highlight that there are many modifiable and non-modifiable causes of Breast Cancer. This cancer is the most common type affecting urban women and is fast approaching the rural population. If you lead a stressful life or have any family history of breast cancer, it is important that you embrace and implement preventive points for breast cancer:Opt for diet that fights Cancer ‚ÄìDiet and Exercise have been highlighted as two of the most important aspects that can prevent cancer. Healthy diet habits reduce risk of cancer breast in women. Inclusion of food of plant origin includes broccoli, berries and garlic containing phytochemicals seems to protect cell from harmful effects. Antioxidants- vitamin C, found in citrus fruits, orange juice, leafy greens, beans and fortified breakfast cereals boosts the body immunity and prevent breast cancer.Exercise to keep the cancer cells at bay ‚ÄìRegular exercise, 30-minute brisk walks helps to keep your weight in check. It can also lower estrogen levels and boost the immune system, helping to prevent any abnormal cells from growing and spreading. Studies have highlighted that women doing brisk walking and minimal exercise alters estrogen metabolism and reduces risk of cancer by 18% compared to women leading a sedentary life style.Always opt for Self Breast Examination ‚ÄìMost important is to know about your own breasts. Women with dense breasts have an increased risk of developing breast cancer by 6 times. Self breast examination is the main tool to pickup early changes. It is also the best way to detect any abnormality in the breast like any discharge from nipples and crusting or redness of nipples.Design your food plate with consideration ‚ÄìEating less of animal products and choosing organic food items decreases the breast cancer risk. Even one alcoholic drink per day could raise your breast cancer risk.Keep a check on your drinking and smoking ‚ÄìDrinking regularly and having two or three glasses of wine or cocktails at once can increase your risk of breast cancer immediately to 20%.Habits of Alcohol and smoking are associated with cancer breast.Chose your cosmetics wisely-Women are using cosmetics containing Parabens is carcinogen, widely used as preservative in deodorant, lipsticks, toothpaste and shampoo. Glycol is one of the most widely used in ingredients in cosmetics and also found in paints, and dyes are proven in risk of cancer of breast. Women should avoid such products.Don‚Äôt shy away from the sun ‚ÄìMost of women avoid sunlight. It is the richest source of Vitamin D- promotes bone growth and bone healing. It is also an alternative to estrogen-lowering drugs to reduce breast cancer risk.Hormone Replacement increases your breast cancer risk-Women on Hormone replacement therapy have an increased risk of developing breast cancer by 30%. Hence limited use of HRT is recommended. Minimizing radiation exposure from screening in women treated for Hodgkin‚Äôs lymphoma, tuberculosis repeated X-Rays should be avoided.Stress is your biggest enemy ‚ÄìWomen managing home and offices suffering from both stress and lack of sleep are most common culprit causeing many diseases and health issues. In fact stress causes lack of sleep, obesity, blood sugar and increases estrogen production. It is also the leading factor causing breast cancer."

79,"Well, I am 19, but I still feel I have figured out the answer to this question which I am going to share with you.First of all, speaking in a very discrete fashion, life makes no sense. We all will die one day (god forbid it, maybe this very moment) and would be just like before - nothing. It won‚Äôt matter if you lived the life of Elon Musk or some random dude (admitted, Elon has lots of problems of his own, but his life is idolised by the masses unlike yours and mine). So why make an effort for anything?Everyone among us does a variety of jobs/emotions everyday which you can classify as ‚ÄòI enjoy it‚Äô (eating, sleeping, partying, watching movies, etc.) and ‚ÄòI hate doing it‚Äô (studying for many, working, waking up to go to office, deadlines, accidental pains, loneliness, breakups, etc.).The quality of your life is determined by the sum total of above. Is the total number of things which you love doing more than those you hate? For most people this is not the case. They are too busy making both ends meet and making a secure future for themselves and their progeny. This is what makes them question their life. It is these people who feel life has no purpose mostly.So, were you better off if you weren‚Äôt created in the first place? Or you are better spending 80 years in the form of life where you would have to go through all these good and bad feelings and circumstances? This makes me wonder if life has no purpose at all. I mean, you are born, go through an education system for 20+ years (to fit in), and then do a job (and face lots of difficulties and failures in life), do the same with your kids, and eventually die. This makes me wonder if all this was a waste. But then, we get to experience so many good stuff in this journey (success, joy, travelling, knowledge, food, music, nature, etc.)So does life have a purpose?Depends on you. If you want to enjoy this beautiful gift and experience as many things as possible, do it now. Don‚Äôt wait for anything. You never know when you will die. You don‚Äôt want to regret not asking out that girl/ going for a trek/ learning the guitar/ completing your PhD in your afterlife (if it exists).If you are someone who is facing a lot of drudgery and all sorts of tragedies (true for most people at least in India and similar developing and underdeveloped nations. Believe it or not, poverty leads to lots of problems which leads to questioning the purpose of life.), then better try to find happiness in whatever you have, because a life without good things is worthless and a pain in the @$$. The quality of your life is more about your perception of it than what the society makes you believe. Even a person with no education, money or love can live happily. So why make it so bad? Enjoy it while you have it.The purpose of life - To live it in such a way that you don‚Äôt ask yourself this question when you die."

81,"Sorry for my delayed response. Depending on the relationship that you have with the birthday recipient, it really doesn‚Äôt matter in my opinion. My only exception to what I said is if it‚Äôs your significant other. In which case I then I always make sure to be the very first person to wish them a Happy Birthday!! If it‚Äôs any other family member, relative, friend etc then I just do my best to make sure I send them wishes on their actual birthday. I‚Äôm actually a bit weird though, in that I do like to be the first person to wish the recipient a Happy Birthday when I can. If I can‚Äôt be, and they‚Äôre someone that is pretty close to me then I will purposefully try to be the very last person to wish them a Happy Birthday - lol!! Now, like I said ‚Äòsomeone that is pretty close to me‚Äô so they know me well and totally get my bizarre sense of humour in doing such a thing :-P.Significant others, immediate family aside, there is times when life kind of gets in the way and I don‚Äôt get the opportunity to wish someone a Happy Birthday on their actual Birthday. In those cases I do send the wishes along as quickly as I can. As I have gotten older it is more important to me to insure that I send the wishes then not, so the particular day though isn‚Äôt the most important thing to me any longer. I try, but don‚Äôt always succeed on the actual day. My friends that I have missed the actual day though are very understanding, laid back, relaxed, and just appreciate the wishes when they do come‚Ä¶be it the day of, or shortly there after.Everyone is different in how they feel about these things though. When I was younger, then absolutely I did kind of expect the wishes on the actual day. Now that I‚Äôm older and more relaxed (not sure I‚Äôd say wiser - lol) I still do expect wishes from certain people on the day, but friends get a pass ;-)."
82,"A2AExpenditure totally depends on how hardy you are, how smartly you can utilize your network, and how finicky you are about comfort and hygiene.I travelled all across India for 1.2 years on a shoestring budget and the total expenses turned out to be a little less than 1 lac rupees. I have covered the entire India and have spent zilch on lodging, as I have been using my social network to host me at their places. This saves my money majorly and gives me an idea of local people and their cultures. One, if one's 'nih-sankochi' about it, can easily use one's social network and the social network of one's direct contacts to reach people across India. On an average a person has 330 direct contacts on social network and if s/he extends it to the first contact of those persons, it can easily lead you to around a lac people across India. Considering only 1 percent of it to be supposedly hospitable gives you 1000 people around India who could host you just for nights - give you a space to sleep - else you have railway stations, newspapers and platform tickets. The only expense that I encounter is food and travel, both of which I make sure is on a shoestring budget - because I prefer street food, as it allows me to interact with the cook and get to know his story and cheap travel, mostly in general class, allows me to interact with the gentry - the real India - India of the villages.P.S. The itinerary map posted by Anonymous user below is outdated. My journey encompassed over 100 cities and around 40 villages, which will come to picture when my fifth book is released.."
83,"It's not universal. There are a few salespeople I've liked alright. (For that matter, my dad was one, and it's something I did for a bit.)But overall, I find I don't like them. And there are some reasons for my annoyance. (This applies to the ones I've actually worked with. If you don't know why people find telemarketers or TV talking heads pitching crap or pushy people behind the counter annoying, I don't know what to tell you.)Lying, or at the very least giving misinformation, and then expecting someone else to fix it for them. If you told a customer the software (or other product) can do something, which in fact it cannot, that is not something that gets treated as an emergency to implement for you. Give the right fucking information next time, don't just say whatever it takes to get the check. And if you're not sure, check before you open your mouth. But you should know what the product you're selling does and doesn't do, or at least know how to find out.Thinking they're in charge. When I was doing startup work, I had more than one in sales think they could come over and try to tell me what I would be working on as a top priority. And then seemed affronted when I told them that they would have to get a PM to move it up, as that was not currently my top item. They seemed to think they could push people around and not follow the process. Granted, I'll be the first one to knock process for the sake of process, but some are there for a reason and really do need to be followed.Pushy. ""No"" means ""no"", not ""rephrase the question slightly and ask it again.""General dishonest temperament and sliminess, especially that constant fake smile, and playing games and politics. If you've got a problem with me or you disagree with me, you discuss it with me. You don't go around behind my back later. Engineers and developers tend to be very honest (sometimes brutally so), but once the matter is settled it's settled, so smile with the knife behind your back and play at politics is not something that goes over well.Not listening, sometimes seemingly deliberately. When I gave you a rough guess as to when something was going to be done, it was a rough guess and I made that clear. It was not a ""commitment"" or anything of the sort. If you went and made it that, you fucked up, not me. Sorry, but especially with breaking new ground, often the answer to ""When will it be done?"" is inexact at best. Developing a new software feature is not like manufacturing a batch of widgets, it's like designing the widgets to start with.Don't do these things, and you'll probably get along with technical types just fine. These aren't true of all salespeople. But in my experience, they're true of way too many."

Though after 25 the growth slows down.There are people who have still grown even after crossing 25 years of age.But the results vary from person to person.If you are thinking of gaining 5 to 6 inches then its not possible.However growth can still take place.When you have crossed a certain age limit then only doing exercises doesn‚Äôt help.Growth after 25 is determined by SUPPLEMENT+POSTURE+DIET+EXERCISES.I have written supplement first as it plays a very important role if growth is to be seen after 25.People worry about taking supplements but there is nothing wrong if you are taking a safe supplement and with a research proof that it helps in increasing height when taken for few months even if you have closed plates.My own brother took supplement and HGH when he was 16 years and 10 months of age and struggling to increase his height. He was 5.5 at that time. He is now 5.10.Before(LEFT SIDE-MY BROTHER;RIGHT SIDE-ME)AFTER (16 WEEKS)Talking about Posture-Many people don‚Äôt just pay attention to their posture. Their incorrect posture makes them look small in height.By doing various exercises in order to correct posture you can look 1 inch to 1.5 taller.Diet-If you are eating nutritious diet but your body is not able to absorb it then it will effect your growth.Eating junk food and soft drinks also hampers growth.Exercises:-Many of my readers are looking for quick solutions in order to increase height.First of all there is not short cut in terms of growing.One has to have patience and follow a set pattern of exercises.Follow these exercises and diet :-Stretches And Exercises To Increase Height and Grow Taller1. JumpOur grandparents have always encouraged us to jump, they claim that it helps you to increase height. Apparently, it‚Äôs not a myth. Jumping really helps you grow taller. This is because your spine and calve muscle stretches when you forcefully lift your feet from the ground to jump. For a twist, you may use a skipping rope. Keep jumping, and you‚Äôll attain your desired height in no time.2. Touch Your ToesThis is the most basic stretch to increase the flexibility of the bones and muscles, thus increase the height. Sit on the floor, keeping your back straight. Then extend your legs to the front, keeping your feet close to each other. From the waist, bend and stretch your hands out to touch the toes of your feet. Do not hunch3. Pelvic StretchTo do this stretch, you first need to lie back down and bend your knees. Place your hands by the side and your palms should touch the ground for some support. Then lift your buttocks as high as you can, your back should form an upward curve.Hold it for about 20 seconds. Then do it again, for about three to four times. This stretch will stretch the spine and strengthen your torso.4.Cobra StretchCobra stretch is pretty well known for its potential in increasing one‚Äôs height. Lie on your abdomen, then with your palms pressing on the ground parallel to your shoulders, lift your hips off the floor. Again, do not hunch, keep your back straight. Hold this position about 20 seconds then come back down. For beginners, this stretch can cause a burning sensation in your lower neck due to the pressure.5.Monkey Bar HangingAnother common exercise proven to increase your height naturally‚Äì and it works. Hanging will give you an amazing result if done regularly, preferably thrice in a week, 10 minutes for each session. Hang on to a monkey bar, you may bend your knees if the bar is too low. You may hang for about 20-30 seconds, and repeat it for 5-7 times.3 Yoga Poses To Grow Taller1.Triangle PoseThe triangle pose when practised regularly can bring many benefits, increase in height is one of them2. Sun SalutationIt does an amazing job in stretching your body muscles overall, particularly the torso and spine. This yoga pose too can help you attain your desired height ..."
86,"Did you mean Myanmar or Nepal by any chance?Generally, Cambodia is in a low threat region and has no earthquakes. Unless you consider the human ‚Äòearthquake‚Äô of the Khmer Rouge era. That was certainly very destructive on the genocide scale‚Ä¶This article here is interesting because it reports that apparently there was a 5.2 earthquake in 1978. Interestingly enough this was during the most intense atrocities inflicted by the Khmer Rouge, and so there were no journalists in the country and no foreign embassies or expats to know about it.Andrew pike‚Äôs answer is correct though. Were it to have an earthquake of any significant impact, there are many buildings that would not sustain strong tremors. That said, so is the case in most of the other lesser-developed countries in Asia‚Ä¶And of course, Cambodia does have its share of floods though. In fact, its culture and economy have largely evolved around a practice of managed flood plains."

Based on all these configurations i would recommend these laptopsDell Vostro 5568 - It‚Äôs quite unpopular as inspiron series is more popular but i would recommend it because it comes with 2 Gb NVIDIA 940mx GDDR5 graphic card and it also packs a fingerprint sensor in it and it‚Äôs price is around 60K.Dell Insprion 15 5577 Gaming - It‚Äôs dell latest laptop , it‚Äôs bit costlier 73k , no problems if it‚Äôs in your budget , it has NVIDIA GTX 1050 4Gb GDDR5 graphic( 1050 is better than 940 mx ) and does not carries a fingerprint sensor.Asus R558UQ-DM701D - It‚Äôs the value for money laptop , it has i7 7th gen , 2 Gb NVIDIA 940mx DDR3 graphic card , if u don‚Äôt concern about gaming too much then buy this without any second thoughts , all others laptops in this price tag have i5 but it has i7 which is a great advantage. It can run all games GTA 5 , Watch Dogs 2 , Assassins Creed Unity etc. but in low settings as compared to other two laptops as it has DDR3 based graphic card. U can get it around 53K.P.S. - 1.

91,"Disclaimer: Following are my personal thoughts. However, I don't intend to propagate it. If you like it, you take or else pass it.1. DO NOT JOIN A PARTY! Though NITs had their individual state reserved system in place, This has been leveraged. However, the things remain the same inside the system. I still feel there remains an animosity among the people based on the Party and Election. Also, DO NOT choose your friends based on the Party. Instead form a good group of friends and interact with Intelligent seniors. Pass the rest!2. WORK SMARTLY!Today's world is competitive. The competition is fierce everywhere. In such situations, you should be skilled. So, Learn some things that gives you an edge over others. Example, Learn UNIX scripting (Perl, Python). For Electrical students, there is still hell lot of other things apart from MATLAB. Have an open mind to learn stuff and keep on going.3. DO NOT JUST SIT IN THE ROOM¬† AND PLAY DOTA, WATCH SITCOMs or SLEEP etc.Gaming and Sitcoms are good entertainment among your friends. Agreed. But, have a limit to everything. There are so many other things that you can do. Attend your classes. I had a professor in my Dept. who used to say that some of you here may not even get a chance to sit in the classroom again even if you want to. Therefore, I made it a point to attend his classes even if it is 7:55 AM to 8:50 am. Do not be lazy! Exercise. Go to gym or sports complex or swimming and make use of these facilities. You wont get these facilities all at one place anywhere! 4. HAVE A GOAL SET IN YOUR LIFE! Setting goal is a continuous process. As the times go by, your aspirations change. But whatever you do, you should be convinced with yourself that 'OK, This is what I wanted to do. Hence, this is what I will do because it interests me'. IMO, an ideal time for this thought will be around the end of 3rd year. If you still don't know about yourself by then, probably you are going to screw your final year by having lack of focus and trying to get what others want not what you want! FOCUS!5. STUDY HARD!I totally agree with Sai. There will be seniors who will tell you maintain just 7 pointer. Well, In case if you come across any senior, Kindly give a Tight Slap from my side! He is simply unaware of the situations currently. In case if you app for higher studies, GPA counts. If you want to apply for PSU, you will be asked why your CG is less in the interview even though your GATE score may be high. In case a PSU, comes to your college, the low pointers will not be called for the interview (General Category). As far as the admissions for B schools are concerned, there also some weightage is given to your undergraduate GPA. Maintain 8+ with no choice!6. FRIENDS!This is what I have been missing after I left from the college. Value your friendship and moments together. Go for a trek with everyone, spend time together discussing about random topics, Dinner together. Times like this you will never ever get.7. PREPARE A BUCKETLIST OF EVENTS THAT YOU WANT TO DO IN COLLEGE!Do some crazy stuff without getting caught so that you will cherish throughout your life and tell this to your grandchildren when you will be old. :D"

93,"The common knowledge holds true, that nightmares are often a reflection of your waking mentalStressing about a looming unpleasantness, as well as anxiety from events passed can cause nightmares. Really traumatic events like car accidents or wars can lead to nightmares with recurring themes, or reliving the event over and over. Healing from the trauma should cause the nightmares to become less frequent and intense over time.If you‚Äôre among the 5% of people who have nightmares often enough to affect your waking hours, consider seeing a therapist.Nightmares can also be caused by medications or drugs, especially ones that affect neurotransmitters like antidepressants or narcotics.People who have what psychologists define as ‚Äúthin boundaries of the mind‚Äù are more prone to nightmares too. These people tend to be more creative and imaginative, and sometimes have trouble separating fantasy from reality. There are also idiopathic nightmares, meaning we don‚Äôt know why they happen, they just do.So if you have a nightmare every now and again, it‚Äôs nothing to worry about. 85% of adults report having nightmares on occasion. They‚Äôre more common for children, particularly young girls, and are likely caused when the child is struggling to cope with normal childhood fears.To understand nightmares, and to a larger extent dreams, it helps to know what‚Äôs happening in your thinking meat while you‚Äôre unconscious. Dreams and nightmares happen during REM (Rapid eye movement ), the last step in the sleep cycle before it starts over. During REM your brain becomes much more active than when you‚Äôre in deep sleep.Your amygdala in your temporal cortex starts humming along during REM, and that little guy is responsible for processing memory, decisions, and emotional reactions. And nightmares are a normal part of sleepIf you wake up due to nightmares more often that you‚Äôd like, or if you‚Äôre struggling to shake them off, there are a few things you can try to banish them from your bedroomStamp out your stress: try some belly breathing or meditation before bed.Don‚Äôt eat before bed: food can speed up your metabolism, which makes your brain more active during sleep.Stay away from scary stories, horror movies and these days‚Ä¶ the night time news!Keep a consistent bedtime routineGo to sleep and wake up at the same time each dayEnsure your bedroom is cool, dark and quiet"
94,"Abstract expressionist were influenced by the vanguards but especially by expressionism itself (the movement that started on 1905) and even more, by surrealism. This movement was influenced by expressionism, I believe, because of the use of colors and because it talks more about emotions than other things, but the actual movement that really was a strong influence was surrealism, because the artists of surrealism search for a way to ""channel the unconscious as a means to unlock the power of imagination"" (taken from www.theartstory.org/movement-surrealism.htm ). The unconscious was a huge part in the abstract expressionist movement as Pollock said when he talked about the Indians Americans and shamanism. He said that if you wanted to get to unconsciousness you go to primitive. In fact, the way he worked was like he was in a ritual and he needed time to connect to do his works.Other influences were people (some european expatriates) who lived though the depression and had lived the second war and the cold war. It's important to notice that, even thought is consider the first Avant-garde of the United States, his first representatives were in fact germans, that were called German Expressionist. It was only later (1946), that the term abstract expressionist was coined by critic Robert Coates.But abstract expressionism is just a way to refer to a really wide movement that was not only abstract. For example, the works of De Kooning are not completely abstract, he pictures women. So the actual description should be ""action painting"", term coined in 1952 by critic Harold Rosenberg."
95,"You must have seen a Cake decorating pen used to decorate or write names/wishes on a cake. See the following image for your reference:We decide that Happy Birthday should be thicker - 1 inch. Using this pen, we keep on writing Happy Birthday over and over again, the Happy Birthday will keep on increasing in height. We'll stop when it's 1 inch high. There we have a 3D Happy Birthday wish written, which we can touch and eat!Now, say, we want to write it using wax. We know wax melts on heating and solidifies very quickly if we remove the heat. We design a decorating pen, in which we feed wax as raw material. The pen heats and melts the wax, deposits this melted wax in subsequent layers to write Happy Birthday. Instead of using hand to write, we automate the process. We make a mechanical system which moves the pen on X,Y and Z axes. We have a computer program which controls the movement of this mechanical system. We feed any text or design to the program, the program feeds it to the mechanical system and the pen moves accordingly to deposit wax and write the text/design.This process of deposition and making designs is 3D printing and the automated decorating pen is a 3D printer!!!You can stop reading here, below is a bit detailed explanation of basic 3D printing. I've tried to keep it very simple.In 3D printing, we have a 3D design of a product on computer. Each 3D printer has an interface (program) we feed this design into. The interface has a program, called Slicer, which slices this design in multiple horizontal layers and then sends the coordinates of each layer to the 3D printer. 3D printer has an extruder, similar to decorating pen in the above example, which melts and places the material at respective coordinates (x-axis and y-axis) for each layer. (The first layer is put on a surface called the build-bed/build-plate and subsequent layers are, typically, on the the layers below them) After each horizontal layer, the build-plate moves down or the extruder moves up (z-axis). The process ends with the deposition of topmost layer. This whole process is called 3D printing.The materials used in 3D printing are thermopolymers - the materials which melt above a certain temperature and solidify quickly on cooling.This is Fused Deposition Modelling 3D printing - the prevalent technology for most desktop 3D printers. This is a very basic explanation. There are other technologies and materials with different properties used in 3D printing.CoCreate 3D - you can see this blog for a simple video explanation and applications of 3D printing."

97,"A Horcrux is an object, living or dead, that stores a part of the desired wizards‚Äôs soul.Simply put, if you want to cut your souls up into pieces then you have to store it in a living body or some ornament, that becomes a Horcrux. This process however dilutes the soul within the main body, and it has huge psychological and slight physical effects.The process of ripping your souls is done by murdering someone. Those deaths must hold a significant value for the wizard, so that their soul with rip under their action. Creating one Horcrux can cause several problems. Voldemort made six.A Horcrux also can‚Äôt be destroyed by a regular weapon or spell, and takes something stronger than it (and very rare, like the basilisk venom) to destroy it. The sword of Gryffindor is an ideal weapon for destroying Horcruxes because it absorbs the power of something stronger than it, and once it absorbed basilisk venom in the fight with young Tom Riddle in Chamber of Secrets.So having Horcruxes makes you nearly immortal, since if you die in one body there is still parts of it left in another body. However this is extremely inconvenient since it relies on someone else recovering the soul and transferring it to a body.Creating Horcruxes out of living beings is inadvisable because the thing can think for itself. So it may act in ways not desired by the owner of the soul. The soul can also possess another living object if someone or something becomes too emotionally attached to a Horcrux, whether it be living or dead.Finally, if someone with Horcruxes is to be killed, then all their Horcruxes must be destroyed before attacking the body that hosts the most whole soul.[ Side fact: If a wizard goes on creating too many Horcruxes, they will degrade mentally to the point they are no longer human (like Voldemort)]"

100,"Definitely, There will be a War between India & Pakistan in future. Nothing is justified as the war happening in Near Future as future has no accurate predictions either it‚Äôs near or distant . But the Scenario will be different & Impact would be huge‚Ä¶I am not talking about the 3rd World War. The current shift in Geopolitics in South Asia has developed a new scenario for India & Pakistan. The historical background of both countries is not quite strange when US sent her 7th Naval Fleet to support Pakistanis in 1971 war on a motive by launching a military offensive against India whereby Soviet Union jumped to rescue of India at Former PM Indira Gandhi‚Äôs request by dispatching a Nuclear Submarine Flotilla.But, the era in the 20th & 21st century is completely different. After India‚Äôs Capitalist economic policy in 1991 & successful Nuclear test in 1998, US tilted towards India at a faster rate. Looking at the Trillions dollar Market & Huge economic potential, US gave several gifts to India to keep her away from Russia. The recent developments in the last 5 years have indicated the evolution of a new war strategy between India & Pakistan ..After coming Pro-USA & right-wing BJP gov on power, India has moved closer to North America providing a gap with Russia. The major steps are taken by the USA has proved American strategy to make India their Girlfriend & believes in empowering Indians so that they can counter Chinese narrative in ASIA. Those major steps taken by USA areRecognising India as a Major Defence Partner.Then, India and United States signed the Logistics Exchange Memorandum of Agreement (LEMOA) in 2016.US supported India to get permanent entry into MTCR, Australian Group & Wassennar arrangement in 2016‚Äì18 & quite optimistic about India‚Äôs NSG entry.US also grants india under Strategic Trade Authorisation-1 list which provides India greater supply chain efficiency, both for defence and for other high-tech products, that will increase activity with US systems, the interoperability of the systems, and it will reduce time and resources needed to get licensing approved.Under these Schemes, US is planning to supply high end weapons like Predator-B Armed Drones, THAAD to india while for better secured communication systems, US is batting to sign COMCASA with India. Both countries are also holding 2+2 talks to deepen their military & economic partnership.While on the Other hand, Pakistan & Russia are getting closer, their recent activities also show the efforts to counter American narrative with India.Russia supplied Mi-17v5 helicopters to Pakistan despite Indian protest.Russia also allowed Pakistani military training on their homeland after US permanently cancelled Training programme with Pakistan.Russian behaviour with Pakistanis are testifying Indians that don‚Äôt get into American camp. If Pakistani are thinking, Russia will support them against India in a war, then it would be believed that either Pakistanis are dreaming or enjoying Mujras. Infact, Russians cannot afford losing a trusted friend like India. They have already over $10 Billion dollars military deal in pipeline, under which India will procure 5 systems of S-400 BMD costing $5 billion, 4 Advanced Frigates ($4 Billion), 1 SSN ($2 Billion) & K-226T LUH ($1 billion) from them.We know Pakistani relationship with chinese protrated as Higher than mountains & deeper than seas. Chinese are empowering Pakistani military by providing them JF-17,Ballistic Missiles , HQ-7 SAM & others. Major chunk of Pakistani military weapons comes from China. Pakistanis now-a-days realising that CPEC is no longer solution to give impetus to their Fragile economy & International organisations like IMF, WB are being hesitant to provide fund to Pakis. Everybody knows if you don't pay off loans at given time, then what happens with your property on that next day. So, there is a possibility of Pakistan becoming a colony of Chinese & You will see inbetween next 3‚Äì4 years Pakistan having Yuan as domestic currency & Mandarin as their official language.So analysing all these activities, we can conclude about Future India & Pakistan war with some major points‚Ä¶If war happens, India will have support from maximum countries including all major powers.India will have both USA & Russia backing during war with Pakistan.India‚Äôs probability on fighting two front war is more when it comes to war with Pakistan in future as China wants to occupy Pakistan due to its Geographical advantage..once China occupied Pakistan, then would be able to control entire Energy route of Asia.Majority of arab countries will support India beacuse of its economic significance.Israelis‚Äô blood aren't yet cold as they haven't avenged the death of their citizens died in 26/11 terror attcak. Therefore, Mossad can launch Cyber Warfare against Pakis by giving an unprecedented edge to India in the battle.This war will be the Do or Die scenario for both nations. Beacuse‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶If Pakistan wins , India will face Gazwa-e-Hind & Huge human disaster will happen.If India wins , there will no Pakistan in the World map..Thank you For Reading‚Ä¶"
101,"Probably not. His Alzheimer‚Äôs had taken quite a toll. By February of 2001 he was isolated because he could only recognize his wife Nancy and a couple other people, and although he had lucid moments they were less and less common - and the family didn‚Äôt want people to remember him like that.So by September it is very likely he didn‚Äôt see them, was kept away from the news, or maybe wouldn‚Äôt have understood what he was seeing. Also, for a man who was memory-disabled, he was quite busy with physical therapy due to a broken hip that January.If he ever said anything, only his immediate family would know.He died in 2004, but a lot of people said the person he was, was gone before then."
102,"Michael Settle and Ian Marshall posted what I think were excellent answers.After the Battle of Chancellorsville, Robert E. Lee was intent upon taking the war to enemy territory. His home state of Virginia had been ravaged by war and it was time to give it a break. It's true that his most trusted lieutenant, Thomas Jackson was dead and there's speculation that Lee may have been stricken by an illness, perhaps a heart attack. But the Army of Northern Virginia and its commander were supremely confident. The Confederate forces moved into Pennsylvania, its mission: forage, capture Harrisburg and gain a victory great enough to warrant European recognition of the CSA. It was forage that led a small group of Rebels into Gettysburg. They were looking for shoes. There they met the advance elements of the Army of the Potomac. From there the conflict grew larger as both armies funneled troops into Gettysburg. Lee recalled his vanguard, well on its way to a poorly defended Harrisburg. Meade concentrated his Union Army on ridges and rocky outcropings affecting a defensive posture. Lee assaulted the Federal right at Culp's Hill, 1st day. He was thrown back. Then he attacked the Federal left, Little Round Top, 2nd day. After the repulse of the Rebel forces at Little Round Top, one of Lee's Corps commanders, Pete Longstreet, after studying the tactical situation, suggested leaving a small force facing the Union Army, withdraw the main Confederate forces, move around the Union left, almost unopposed and poise itself between the Army of the Potomac and its Capitol, Washington D.C. Then the Rebels could fight on the ground of their choosing. Remember Lee was an exceptional engineer. He designed the killing fields of Fredericksburg and Cold Harbor. Longstreet was rejected and his corps wrecked on Gettysburg's 3rd day, ‚ÄòLongstreet's Assault', or as it is popularly known as 'Pickett's Charge.‚ÄôWhy did Lee reject Longstreet? Perhaps it was the absence of his cavalry commander J.E.B. Stuart and the vital information he desperately needed for his army's survival in enemy territory. Maybe it was hubris, his confidence in the men of his command and their cause. Or maybe he didn't fully recover from his supposed ailment after Chancellorsville and the death of Stonewall Jackson.Pete Longstreet would go on later in 1863 to help win a brilliant victory at Chickamauga."
103,"The Sun Also Rises by Ernest Hemingway - often regarded as the first modern novel, features Hemingway‚Äôs pared down descriptive style and honest language. It is also a very fine story of a love that can never be.Slaughterhouse 5 by Kurt Vonnegut - fictionalized account of a man‚Äôs journey through PTSD told in Vonnegut‚Äôs unique brand of satire.To Kill a Mockingbird by Harper Lee - the story of an every day hero told through the eyes of his young daughter. In extraordinarily readable prose, Lee delivers a sermon on equality and pre-judgement.The Call of the Wild by Jack London - beautiful story telling that says something important about the thin line between wildness and civility.1984 by George Orwell - a warning about a society lulled into enslavement by gradually trading convenience and security for their freedom. (giving this book a run for its money would be Brave New World or A Clockwork Orange)The question is a little generic - my answer would vary if the slant was the 5 best enjoyable reads or the 5 best for a military officer or manager, etc - these five are the five that I think are most important balancing literary significance and quality of story/writing across a range of human experience."

107,"Pity is the compassionate sorrow we feel towards the suffering of others.Love can be defined many ways, but for simplicity I will define it as a deep feeling that binds one person to another. It can mean many kinds of love - the love of friends, the love of one‚Äôs pet, but it is romantic love we are most interested in and that‚Äôs the definition I will address.You can feel pity towards someone you love, if they are suffering, but if you take the pity away, what do you have left to feel for them?It is easy to mistake the two. Sometimes, we meet someone for whom we feel deep pity. Compassion moves us, makes us want to hold them, care for them, help them, heal them. So many relationships begin this way. One cares for the other, and it is this ebb and flow of pity and suffering that defines and supports the relationship. It isn‚Äôt to say that love cannot grow out of a relationship that begins with pity, but if pity is mistaken for love, again, what remains when the suffering is gone? What is left when the wounds have healed?Often people fall back from relationships they thought were love, confused and torn because they feel the loss of the relationship and only later realize that it was not love they felt, but pity. They may feel that the love was a lie, but it was that they were confused by their feelings, that what they thought was love might have only been sorrow for the suffering of the other, and after they give each other solace - nothing of substance remains. We often cling long to failing relationships moved by our pity, confusing it for love.There is in romantic love always the question of endurance to be reckoned with. We ask ourselves if the relationship we are in will endure, whether it should last. We worry whether the love is real, or whether it is some other feeling that feels like love. We wonder what the other feels for us. Great shows of compassion can feel like loving attention, and it can make the giver feel like they are acting out of love - because compassion is a kind of love. It just isn‚Äôt that ideal romantic love which we so often compare all love to, and so often find all our loves falling short.At the end of these confused relationships, we often hear one hurt partner say, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want your pity.‚Äù What they often mean is: ‚ÄúI wanted your love, but all you offer is your pity, and that‚Äôs not enough and I can‚Äôt stay with you if that‚Äôs all you can give me.‚Äù The imbalance inherent in the relationship causes it to tip over and break apart, but we don‚Äôt always see it until the illusion is shattered. We have mistaken pity for love."

111,"A lot of people only ranked countries based on military power, but they fail to realize the importance of soft power. So, I will list both. It is 10/2/2018 right now, for any future reader that will read this.Soft Power(in no particular order):United StatesThe U.S. is undoubtedly a very powerful soft power. Hollywood has the most successful movie industry to date by far, and spreads American culture worldwide. The U.S. is also considered the symbol of democracy, freedom, and capitalism(although ironically, neither the most democratic, free, and capitalist country). Although the recent America-first policies ventured by Donald Trump has somewhat decreased the soft power of the U.S., it still remains very influential in world politics today. It is a permanent member of the U.N. security council too.United KingdomBritain exerts its influence to a great many number of countries, especially to mainland Europe and the members of the Commonwealth. Due to its days as the most powerful and widespread empire on Earth, parts of Africa and North America is undoubtedly impacted by the days of its occupation. For example, English is the second most spoken first language as well as the most spoken second language, and British sports like football(the one that actually uses the foot mostly), cricket, tennis, and golf are among the most played today.South KoreaSouth Korea has only begun to have relevant soft power very recently, from the effects of the Korean Wave, or Hallyu. The spread of K-pop, Korean food, and Korean culture has truly been almost miraculously fast.JapanDo I really need to explain this one? Anime, J-pop, East Asian politics, Henta-I mean, adult animation.FranceFrance has the most annual tourists in the world, and, much like the U.K., exerts great influence over many of its former colonies and the rest of Europe. It is also part of more multi-lateral organization than any other country in the world, and, according to Soft Power 30 , has the best leader in the world in terms of engagement.Other countries that I do not have the willpower or time to mention, but still deserve a place:IndiaChinaGermanyRussiaItalySpainVatican CityMilitary Power(in order of strength)U.S.AForget about China‚Äôs South Sea ambitions. Forget about Russia. Forget about North Korea‚Äôs nukes.Without doubt, any speculation, or any thought, I can confidently say that the United States of America is the absolute, unchallenged military superpower in the world as of today.Not India. Not China. Not Russia. The U.S., and only the U.S. I dare anyone to challenge me on this claim.It has hundreds of the most powerful jet fighter(and the only ‚Äúreal‚Äù 5th gen. fighters) in the world, about half of the world‚Äôs AEGIS or similar-to-AEGIS ships in the world, and 2/3 of all the aircraft carriers in the world. It also has the most 3rd and 3rd+ gen. tanks in the world, the best power projection in the world, by far the highest military budget, the biggest military industry, and the only actual stealth bombers.You know something‚Äôs going on if the world‚Äôs second strongest air force is part of your navy.A fraction of America‚Äôs full might, but enough to destroy the navies and air forces of a country with a military on the ranks of 25+2. RussiaAlthough far from a superpower after the collapse of the Soviet Union, Russia still maintains the second most powerful conventional military in the world. It still leads the non-western world in terms of military technology in almost all areas, and actively continues to develop them. They have the second strongest army, the third strongest air force(if you count the U.S. Navy), and 3-4th strongest navy(this is very disputable, but it‚Äôs my own estimate.).3.

112,"Image via MedSyndicateThere‚Äôs some conflicting advice out there on whether you should use heat or cold for lower back pain. A study back in 2006 found that heat decreased acute low-back pain immediately after application. As for cold, there was not enough evidence to pull any information on whether it actually helped or not. With that said, the 2006 studies had a very small pool of participants, so can it might ultimately not be an accurate representation on the effects of hot and cold.With that said, the most popular suggestion for decreasing back pain is as follows:In the first 24 to 72 hours, use ice to help reduce inflammation, pain and swelling. You can use a cold pack, iced towel, frozen vegetables or ice cup. In the first 72 hours ice the area for 10 minutes every hour if you can. Then you can go to icing 3 times a day.After 72 hours, start applying heat to encourage healing. Heat helps stimulate blood flow, inhibits pain and decreases stiffness. Moist heat (hot packs, baths or showers) work better than electric heating pads. Still, if you need some pain relief during the day, consider using an all-day heat wrap.You can also try alternating between hot and cold, using heat for 15 minutes first then cold an hour later for another 10 to 15 minutes.Chronic back painImage via Sunrinity HealthThe above advice works well if you‚Äôre experiencing pain after an injury. But what if you have chronic pain? Most office workers likely have some form of chronic lower back pain due to poor posture when sitting and just sitting down for 8+ hours a day. If this sounds like you, then you might want to look into some other options to help manage your pain:Lower back braces can help support the lower back, which alleviates some of the lower back pain. There are a variety to choose from for men and women.Get a chair support to improve your posture when sitting at your work desk.Exercise can help improve back pain as it strengthens your core and back muscles.Improve your sitting and standing posture as bad posture can strain your muscles.Get a massage to help relieve muscle tension, spasms, inflammation and stiffness. Not to mention it can help improve circulation and flexibility. Go to a certified professional for best results.If your consistent lower back pain is hindering your usual activities, the best thing you can do is go to your doctor to get it checked out. It might be a bigger health issue than you realize. Luckily, most lower back pain can be treated without surgery so long as it‚Äôs treated immediately.Disclaimer - This advice should not be taken in lieu of medical advice. If you have lower back pain from an injury or chronic back pain, speak to your doctor or medical professional."

114,"So from where I left off, My sister got angry, viewing from a ‚Äúdaughters‚Äù perspective, because my mom cared more about the car, then her own daughter‚Äôs life. My mom even cried over seeing the car destroyed. So, in this situation, I can kind of understand my mom caring more about the car, because at that time, we only had one car, my mom‚Äôs car, and she used that to get to work, take any of us to school, and etc. So what I thought was that my mom cares more about the car because she uses that to get to work, and working earns money, and money helps support the family. Although, I might be wrong, and there might be a different reason why. So, fast forwarding to the present time, my mom and my sister are the only ones that work in the family, but my sister doesnt provide for the family. So, a few weeks after the car crash, my moms ‚Äúboyfriend‚Äù lives with us, and he has a car, and then my sister argued to my mom that she has to go to work and she needs a car, so my mom actually didnt get to buy another car for herself to replace her car my sister accidentally crashed, but bought my sister her own car with insurance. So then a few months later, my mom buys my brother his own car, so she switches using her boyfriend‚Äôs car and my brother‚Äôs car to go to work varying day to day. So, here's where the question weighs in that I‚Äôm curious about. Okay, so my sister is an extrovert, she likes to party, hang out with her friends, and etc., she does pay for her own phone bill and her car, but she‚Äôs also the type of person who once she gets paid, she spends it right away on food, clothes, gas, unnecessary stuff like alcohol or parties or like going out, and bills sometimes, which is fine, but that's also the problem too. She parties every single night, goes out to hang out with her friends nearly everyday, and does practically whatever she wants, even disappearing for a few days without telling my mom (I'm also confused, if you live under your parent‚Äôs roof, don‚Äôt you still have to listen to their rules? My sister thinks that since she's an adult, she can do whatever she wants), and not listening to my mom to the point of ignoring everything my mom says or not showing respecting to her, like walking out of the house to party while my mom is speaking to her. I‚Äôve also seen this countless times over the past year, where she asks my mom to pay for her bills like for her phone or car, because she didn't have any money left over from spending it on parties, or food, plus my sister got 2 speed tickets over the past few months so my mom had to pay for that too, because my sister didn‚Äôt have any money either, but the thing is, she tells me all the time that she pays for her own stuff, and she doesn't need my moms help, but she lies. Its true, but not entirely. The thing is, my family isn't rich, my mom doesn't have a lot of money, she practically pays for everything. I don‚Äôt know if anyone else does this, maybe this isn't taking advantage of. I‚Äôm not exactly sure what to call this, maybe I'm being biased, maybe what my sister is doing is just what you call youthfulness or living in the moment (shes a young adult by the way), but I‚Äôm just curious, which is worse though, caring more for material items over someone's life (my mom), or taking advantage of someone (my sister)? I really need some outside thoughts to clear up this question, because I‚Äôm not an extrovert like my sister, and I'm not a mom either, so I can't exactly relate to them.

She knows how to arrange meetings so that she and her chosen lover can have their trysts. She hates the Party and is in that respect similar to Winston, but she really just evades it. Its rule actually ending is beyond her mental horizon. It is said in the novel that she couldn't conceive of something like an independent political movement. Younger than Winston, she has grown up in the world of the Party and can't imagine anything else.Whenever Winston tries to talk ""politics"" with Julia, she gets bored and impatient. It happens over and over again. She is not a deep thinker; she is in it for the sex and for the thrill. She even falls asleep when he reads aloud Goldstein's forbidden book, which explains the true mechanics and ideology of the society created by the Party. Then again, Julia perhaps could have survived longer than Winston. We eventually learn that the Thought Police had had its eyes on Winston for at least seven years, O'Brien awaiting the perfect moment to bring him to the Ministry of Love and ""cure"" him. It is possible (though unconfirmed) that Julia, with all her cunning, had never been detected -- before she decided to romantically approach a man who was already under the surveillance of the Thought Police.

121,"Kentucky.It is well known that Kentucky has the finest horses in America. We will simply sweep down from the foothills of the Appalachians and cut a terrifying swath across Ohio and Indiana before we put Chicago to the torch and the sword. From there we shall commandeer their lake fleet, do a surprise crossing to Michigan (evading the forces amassed in a ring outside Chicago, thinking us trapped), and circle back through the Upper Peninsula to take Madison and Minneapolis. This gives us the headwaters of the Mississippi. We will simply repatriate the conquered Upper Peninsula to Canada and then, reinforced by lusty volunteers from the steppes of Sasketchewan, we will construct giant wooden barges and sail down the Mississippi, establishing garrisons near Cairo and the headwaters of the Missouri. Captive Missourians and Kansans will be forced to work in a massive earthworks project while our Canadian Hessians hold the borders, and we will change the course of the Mississippi.No one will see this coming.Now that Vicksburg and New Orleans have been reduced to strategic irrelevancy and the nation has been cleft in twain, our rampaging horde strikes across the plains of Kansas and Oklahoma, leaving a trail of smoke and ruin two leagues wide at its thinnest point, until we reach Wichita Falls. By this point the redirected Mississippi should be causing subsidence earthquakes all up and down the center third of America (indeed, ringing church bells as far away as Boston), and the superstitious Texans will be easily cowed.We shall teach the I-35 Corridor the meaning of fear, and the mileposts will be replaced with human heads. Walls of flame will spring up wherever the earth trembles at our step, from Dallas to Waco, as those with the courage join us and the rest die. Panicked villagers will flee to the east, where they will drown in the new Mississippi, and the west, where they are picked off by the resurgent and rearmed Comanche. Our conquering horde will pause in Austin to make a sacred pilgrimage to Enchanted Rock, the holy place where Conan the Barbarian was born, and then, inspired, we shall carve a bloody scar across the face of Texas from San Antonio to El Paso. Once we control Eagle Pass and the Rio Grande, we have essentially split America in half and joined Canada to Mexico. Tightening our grip, we shall institute our policy of retributive terror against our captive cities, particularly Dallas.We shall make an example of Dallas.There will be a pile of fresh skulls stacked before every McDonalds playscape in the DFW area.We will also switch over to the Amero and ban prayer in public schools.Now that we have tightened our iron grip across the soft midsection of these (formerly) United States, our most pressing needs are bows and arrows. The rampage across the Grain States garnered us more than enough geese and ducks for proper fletching, but the hard wood that we require for shafts and bows is difficult to find anywhere in the areas we control (except for the Upper Peninsula, which we shortsightedly gave to the Canadians). Our only choice will be to lunge across Roswell and Carlsbad, filling those famous caverns with blood, and then feint around Albequerque. They will assume we are going for Los Alamos, but our real targets are the forests of northwestern New Mexico. Once we have installed ourselves in our ancient seats of power in the Anasazi homelands we will be unstoppable. Death shall be our servant, fire our only friend.At this point the weaker-willed states such as Utah and Alabama will flock to our banner, and of course Tennessee and West Virginia were rooting for us all along. New Jersey will join us after a daring diplomatic mission in which I parachute into Parsippany and promise Governor Christie the repatriation of Ellis Island, Liberty Island, and Staten Island if they will join us in the fight. He will of course accept, because that guy knows a good thing when he sees it, and will provide us with a legion of Camden Irregulars and a group of volunteer kommisars from Northern New Jersey. Treachery will grant us West Point (my granddad used to work there, I know people) and a simple pincer movement will isolate Manhattan Island from Long Island, cutting Fort Tryon off from their supplies and forcing New York City to, finally, capitulate to New Jersey. New Jersey will find our victory sweet, and reward us with many big-haired beauties.Now the American government has been drawn and quartered by our rampaging horde. We hold absolute dominion over a third of the nation, and the remaining third is in complete chaos, unable to provide social services or even guarantee the safety of their citizens after night falls. In fear the Army will withdraw, protecting themselves instead of the civilian centers. Now is the moment. In the dread silence of the terror we have sown we shall mount a simultaneous offensive on Washington D.C. from our West Virginian lair and send our rested and replenished Kentuckian forces trampling up the edge of the Rockies into the stony citadels of Colorado Springs. The tall timbers of the Sangre de Cristo Mountains shall form our catapults and trebuchets, and the very same red rocks of which Denver is so proud shall rain down upon their heads. They cannot resist us, for God is on our side.At this point the American government will be reduced to the Central Valley of California, which, to be fair, is totally self sufficient and could hold out against us for decades. So we'll give them cholera."

125,"Masood Azhar is a terrorist. End of debate.His organisation, JeM, if I'm not wrong, has already been blacklisted by the UN.In international relations and geopolitics, nobody cares who's right. Everybody only cares who's strong.If you are strong, you can absolutely do anything a still get away with it.Every single war of US after WW2 has been a farce. Does anyone dare say anything? Nope. If some biggie (India, UK) says anything, there's gonna be major diplomatic fallout. If some weak nation says anything, (Syria, Iraq, Algeria) then they better get prepared for war cuz they're gonna be bombed day in and out after the statement. The pretext will of course be 'War on Terror'.China is an expanisonist nation. They consider Taiwan, Tibet, CoK, Arunachal etc. all part of China. They are total back-stabbers and are the least loyal country in the world. All they want is to become the big daddy of the world.US is already the big daddy of the world and so that puts both of them into direct conflict. China will do anything to achieve superpower status and treats everyone as use-and-throw.Pakistan is the ultimate use and throw country of the world. US exploited Pak very well to push back the Soviets. Soviets are extinct, so now Pak is quite useless to US.Now, what US wants is to prevent China from becoming powerful. The only way they can prevent it is by supporting India. So now India is US's use and throw country. They know India is like the innocent kid, hell bent on helping everyone.Now, this puts China and India directly into conflict. Already, we have lots of disputes with China about water sharing, boundaries, etc. India being US's pawn is a major irritant for China.So what should they do? Well they know Pak is dumb and can be exploited very easily and as it is it has fallen out of favor with US, so Pak would love to lick their feet. Off they go to convince Pak. Pak accepts the proposal in return for China acting against India's interests.So that is why, China is rejecting India's candidature for NSG, UNSC and Masood's blacklisting. China very much knows India has become too strong for a war, so they are using their soft power. They are bribing nations with their line of credits and in return are getting support for they do and silence when they do something wrong.It's a big game of Chess which is being played here in South Asia. India-China relations will be what defines 21st century. India needs to stand up on its own and stop being reliant on other countries. As soon as each country achieves its objectives, they are gonna dump India.Everyone will provide India with enough support to keep China bogged down. But no one will ever provide India so much of support that Pakistani problem gets solved and China is defeated. This is because if India becomes more powerful than China, it means again India will be in direct conflict with Russia and US for the status of superpower.Russia made India pay extra for their defence equipments and forced India to buy only their equipments in exchange for their support and veto powers. So don't think Russia is our 'all weather ally'. Just see Russia and Pakistan's bonhomie.Conclusion:China is using its soft power to act against India's interests as Pakistan requested them to, in exchange for influence and furtherance of their objectives all over Asia through CPEC and Gwadar, both of which pass through Pakistan.Thank you for reading my answer !If you like my answer or style, do hit the upvote button and follow for more of such answers.I hope we meet again........Yours sincerely,The Aerospace Maven"

127,"Women who do use Vitamin C in the early days as one of their natural miscarriage methods need to consume one pill, of 500 mg every hour, for a period of 4 to 10 days. At times, women are asked to get up a few times in the middle of the night just to take the required number of pills during the night. While it is not a given that Vitamin C will lead to a miscarriage, taking this vitamin may just make it easier for a woman to miscarry. This is because Vitamin C has the ability to weaken the bond between the wall of the uterus and the egg. However, in order to induce a miscarriage with Vitamin C a woman will need to consume certain types of Vitamin C pills, as the foods that are high in Vitamin C do not contain the required doses. The ascorbic acid that is present in Vitamin C could cause a woman to miscarry, but most of the brands of Vitamin C tablets contain bioflavoids and other substances, which counter the effect of the ascorbic acid on the body. Tablets that do not contain bioflavoids usually do not have the required amount of ascorbic acid to induce a miscarriage in a person. Moreover, the Vitamin C pills will need to be taken in the early stages of pregnancy, for them to have any effect. This is because once the woman is past the 4th week of gestation, the bond between the egg and the walls of the uterus are too strong to be broken by Vitamin C.It is believed that after 4 weeks of gestation, Vitamin C will not lead to a miscarriage, but will reduce the supply of blood, oxygen and nutrients to the baby, which will result in baby with low birth weight, a disabled child or a child that is mentally stunted. This is one of the main reasons that most health experts strongly urge women to avoid using any home remedies for an abortion. Moreover, such practices are extremely dangerous and could have a seriously adverse effect on the woman's body. The damage caused by Vitamin C pills taken for an abortion could also be permanent not just for the mother, but also the child. Based on the woman's health condition and medical history, in some rare cases, consuming Vitamin C pills could also be fatal. Women who have any problems that are related to their kidneys should not use even try to induce miscarriage with Vitamin C. This is because a high level of ascorbic acid has can have a bad effect on the kidneys and could lead to kidney stones and other kidney related problems. Women, who take high doses if Vitamin C, generally suffer from copper deficiency, as this Vitamin interferes with the body's intake of the mineral. Hence they may be required to take a copper supplement too. However, it is absolutely essential to consult a doctor before taking any medication or vitamin."

They'll make sure that you have a good time, they'll respect your choices and will not finish soon before you're done.Deeper understandingThere's no denying that a man with maturity in age and thoughts will be able to match your wavelength much better. The older man will let you do the things you want to and will encourage you to maintain your individuality.Their attractiveness is beyond comparisonJust like we said earlier, it's hard not to look twice and ogle at the brilliance of a matured man, especially if he has the whole silver fox thingy going on for himYour conversations will be of this world and beyondSince your man is older, he's seen the world and more people than you have. And he knows how to carry on a conversation - from gossiping to talking about politics, to the workings of the world and the plans he has for the two of you, this man can talk about everything and anything under the sun.Emotional stabilityIf you're dating an older man, then you're all in with your feelings already. Because man, this guy has some magnetic charm that makes you feel safe around them.

136,"There's two ways to conceptualize this question, and the answer to both versions includes a ""Yes"".The first is, ""Does it matter if human beings are just selfish, or if they're actually malicious?""The second is, ""Does it matter when human beings either are selfish or evil?""I'll take the second first because it's the less important one.Of course a person using a self-centered way of thinking will on average likely harm others, and a person who is acting out of malice will likely harm others.Sometimes, by accident, a person who is selfish might benefit people. Even a malicious person might do so. A person who killed a random individual for fun could unwittingly have killed a serial murderer and thus saved many lives. But it's precisely because outcomes are not consistently predictable that we look at the reasoning and behavior patterns of people. We look at their ethical decision-making process, because unless you are skillful, compassionate and clear-minded, on average you will do more harm than if you were skillful, compassionate and clear-minded.Let's consider for a moment the idea, ""Greed is good"". This idea is wrong and irrelevant.It's wrong because it assumes that one is only greedy in certain normative situations. It's arguable (if ultimately in my view incredibly false) that a system of decentralized actors seeking their best interest can lead to the best possible outcome. (This is not, incidentally, what Adam Smith actually believed). But that system has to have specific rules, and those people have to go home and be willing to otherwise comply with the law. It's relatively easy to con people, defraud people, etc. without being caught and this is not maximally efficient.It's wrong because in practice we're seeing the world start to cook because of the idea that ""Greed is good"".It's wrong because the outcomes of ""Greed is good"" are only even in theory efficient in certain ways and for certain stakeholders. Prosperity isn't the only thing that matters; in fact, it's a very poor metric for human happiness.It's irrelevant because, even if one were to act greedily, one could easily do so in an enlightened way, instead of a brutal one.And it's finally irrelevant because even if Greed were good then Greed would still obviously matter.So, yes, obviously people having selfish or malicious or cruel or short-sighted motives matters tremendously. The first question, though, has to be answered, ""Yes, but that's not the only possible outcome and it's not the only relevant variable"".People can be selfish or selfless. They can be artistic geniuses or be unable to do anything besides color within the lines. The generous pillar of the community can be a brutal miser when it comes to her work. The secret agent can torture and kill then come home and kiss the wife, kids and dog, not hurting a single person at home.If you want people to be more than selfish or evil, you can't just change the people. That obviously helps, but it's only half of the equation. You have to change the environment. You have to make an environment where being a good guy isn't to be a sucker, where a knight does better than a rogue, where coming to the table and negotiating is better than sabotage and violence.People are forcefields. They can be a lot of different things internally, but even if they didn't change in response to other forcefields around them, they still wouldn't matter much. Throw a little blue paint into a sea of red and it doesn't change much."
137,"There are three types of passive transport:Diffusion:Solutes travel along their concentration gradient from areas of higher concentration to lower concentration. Regarding diffusion, the solutes are able to tranverse the semipermeable cellular membrane. These are usually smaller, non-polar, and uncharged molecules, molecules that easily pass through the phospholipid bilayer.Ex. A high concentration of oxygen outside the cell relative to inside the cell will lead to the diffusion of oxygen from outside to inside the cell.OsmosisWater travels from areas with a lower solute concentration to areas with a higher solute concentration.Ex. If you were to drink a lot of salt water, water would flow out of your cells so that both solutions in and outside of your cells were isotonic since the salt water would have a lot of salt in comparison to the intracellular environment. This is also why it is dangerous to drink a lot if salt water.Facilitated DiffusionProtein channels or carrier proteins, still not requiring any energy as it‚Äôs still along a solute‚Äôs concentration gradient, assist/facilitate the diffusion of a solute from areas of higher concentration to lower concentration. This would occur with molecules that are larger, polar, and/or charged, molecules that do not easily pass through the phospholipid bilayer.Ex. Aquaporin protein facilitates the transport of water in and out of the cell.Key things about passive transport:-it‚Äôs always along the solute‚Äôs concentration gradient (regarding osmosis, this means water travels to the area of higher concentration to dilute it and reduce the concentration)-it‚Äôs always spontaneous/does not require energy"

I wanted my retirement back.My dad explained it to me:Well first you go to nursery school for two years, then kindergarten, then 12 years of school, then 4 years of college, then probably another 4 years of graduate school, then you work for 40 years, then when you are as old as grandpa, you‚Äôll be retired and you can do whatever you want.WHAT!!!!Oh god. And then I went to school and everyone hated me (that thing about shitting in your pants while lying on top of a group of kids just didn‚Äôt work very well in a social environment). And then in grade school it didn‚Äôt work (peeing in your pants doesn‚Äôt work either). And then college didn‚Äôt work (homework? tests? a girlfriend who was throwing food at me whenever she got angry, which was every day, and grad school didn‚Äôt work (I got thrown out)). Then jobs didn‚Äôt work. I was always trying to do something on the side (write a novel, start a business). I wasn‚Äôt very good at corporate politics. Later, when I had more flexible jobs I would disappear for months at a time (CEO to me: ‚ÄúJim Cramer wants to know why you are never here‚Äù) or I would just disappear completely (in the middle of a meeting, walking out of the building, never coming back).(maybe the house Claudia and I will move to when we retire)‚ÄúWork‚Äù is just a tiny subset of the life around you. You do it to live. You do it when you have to. All other times it should be avoided. You‚Äôre in the Matrix but you don‚Äôt realize it. Bit by bit you can plan your escape.‚ÄúBut what if I have no money?‚Äù you might say. Good question. EVERYONE has skills to develop multiple streams of income on their own. Make sure you are healthy. Make sure you are coming up with ideas nonstop and your idea muscle is healthy. Be around supportive people. Give yourself a five year time period to break free. And then start dipping your feet in the River of Change. Once you are immersed from toe to head, you will feel as if you are suffocating for air. But you will find an ocean of life swimming around you. You‚Äôll swim off the island, into the current, and sometimes those currents will be rough, will throw you around, will make you feel like you are going to die, crashing into the rocks. But you will never swim back to that little island. The entire world needs¬† to be explored.That is your ‚Äúretirement‚Äù. It can start right now and it will never be boring and it will never end.Note: I answer this and similar questions in http://www.jamesaltucher.com/cat..."

141,"An escort agency is a company that provides escorts for clients, usually for sexual services. The agency typically arranges a meeting between one of its escorts and the client at the customer's house or hotel room (outcall), or at the escort's residence (incall). Some agencies also provide escorts for longer durations, who may stay with the client or travel along on a holiday or business trip. While the escort agency is paid a fee for this booking and dispatch service, the customer must negotiate any additional fees or arrangements directly with the escort for any other services that are not provided by the agency involved, such as providing sexual services (regardless of the legality of these services). wikipediaMaking it easier for common men to get laid is better for everyone.

Eat a large green salad as your main dish at least once a day, with a healthy dressing. (My comment: Google ‚Äúnut-based dressings,‚Äù or do what I do: add sliced apple, raisins, walnuts, pecans or some combination of these.)2. Eat around two ounces of nuts and seeds a day. Include walnuts and ground flax seed.3. Eat some beans every day, in a soup, chili or burger. (My comment: Or take a corn tortilla and add refried beans, corn and salsa.)4. Eat a large serving of cooked green vegetables every day. (I find if I microwave any green veggie and add either seasonings or a splash of Trader Joe‚Äôs balsmaic-vinegar glaze and French‚Äôs mustard, it takes great. Or I add pasta sauce. And every day I cook chopped onions in a few tablespoons of water until soft and then add a chopped veggie, such as bok choy and chopped mushrooms, perhaps with a splash of soy sauce.)5. Eat fresh fruit with each meal. (Especially berries!)Here‚Äôs Joel Furhman, M.D.‚Äôs more specific advice for athetes:‚ÄúMore and more professional athletes from a wide range of sports have adopted a Nutritarian style of eating. They are not all vegan Nutritarians, but they have sworn off processed foods, minimized animal products and are eating lots of veggies, beans, nuts and seeds.NFL defensive lineman David Carter, also known as ‚Äúthe 300 pound vegan,‚Äù made news with his diet of whole plant foods. In a recent article in GQ, Carter described what he eats in a typical day: several smoothies made from greens, berries, beans and sunflower seeds; whole grains, beans, nuts, avocado and salad. He also noted that the joint pain he attributed to his football career disappeared after he changed his diet.1He reports he is quicker, has better stamina and actually got stronger.Powerlifter Nathaniel Jordan follows a vegan Nutritarian diet. High-nutrient plant foods fuel his strength. Weighing 165 pounds, with about 5 percent body fat, Nathaniel can bench press 275 pounds, squat 445 pounds and deadlift 600 pounds‚Äîand counting. Previously, overweight, his Nutritarian diet enabled him to not only become one of the strongest pound‚Äìfor‚Äìpound athletes in the world, but also to lose 90 pounds of body fat.These stories of Nutritarian professional athletes are beginning to break stereotypes and correct misconceptions about strength and athletic performance. For an athlete in a sport that demands a large body size, maximizing performance without compromising health and longevity is a challenge.Old myths about what to eat to maintain a strong, muscular body and support high levels of physical activity keep many athletes from improving the nutritional quality of their diet. As a result, they continue to rely on calorie-rich, nutrient-poor foods that promote bulk but do not promote health.Training triggers muscle building and dietary protein provides the raw materials that muscles need to grow stronger. Large athletes must meet large calorie and protein needs, but meat, milk, eggs and whey protein shakes are unnecessary.Nutrient dense plant rich foods for the athleteConsider the protein content of a meal of beans, a whole grain (here, quinoa) and green vegetables, topped with a cream sauce made from nuts and seeds:1.5 cups red kidney beans, cooked 22 grams of protein, 340 calories1 cup quinoa, cooked, 8 grams of protein, 220 calories1 ounce Mediterranean pine nuts, 10 grams of protein, 160 calories.2 ounces hemp seeds, 20 grams of protein, 320 calories.2 cups broccoli, cooked, 12 grams of protein, 105 calories.1 cup spinach, cooked, 5 grams of protein, 40 calories.Total: 77 grams of protein, 1,185 caloriesMediterranean pine nuts and hemp seeds are high-protein, calorie-dense foods great for muscle building without the drawbacks of animal products.

146,"Why does the Quora Partner Program pay you to ask questions, rather than answer?If Quora paid for answers, how would that work?Suppose Dudley Poindexter with fourteen followers answered a question with a well-researched and nuanced piece, complete with references and footnotes. His answer gets a hundred views and ten upvotes.Meanwhile, Suzy Rottencrotch with her cute profile pic and five thousand followers writes a vapid opinion piece, replete with spelling errors and questionable logic. Her answer goes on to amass five thousand views and five hundred upvotes.Who gets paid?Suzy‚Äôs answer generated more ad impressions, but isn't worth the time it took to read it. Meanwhile, Dudley‚Äôs answer is barely a blip on anyone's radar. Quora wants to generate ad revenue, especially from outside Quora itself, but it understandably doesn't want to direct outside traffic from search engines to Suzy‚Äôs work. The site would lose credibility very quickly and would be operating at cross purposes to its stated mission.And what happens if twenty other people weigh in with their answers, some of which restate Dudley‚Äôs answer, some of which contain fundamental errors, and some of which are just trolling attempts?How do you determine who should get what? And what prevents people from churning out bullshit, repetitive answers in the hopes of making a few cents?We're already seeing that with some of the questions.All of this is ignoring a much larger, more salient point: There is no shortage of people willing to answer. There is a need for more good questions. The answers on Quora do not drive the traffic. Not the internal or the external. The questions do. Without the questions, there can be no answers."

149,"Yes, you should.One should take the vaccine as early as possible. More the delay, lesser is the probability of timely sero-conversion (production of enough antibodies in your body before the start of the actual disease so that disease can be prevented). Following are important points for the people in your situation-If you can trace the dog and know it is well/ alive for 10 days, you need not to worry because most of the rabid dogs will die within 10 days of appearance of rabies virus in its saliva. IDEALLY ONE SHOULD GET VACCINE ASAP AND may stop further doses if dog is well after 10 days of bite. But at least three doses are recommended.If you can not trace the dog and don‚Äôt know about its vaccination status, ideally you should get vaccinated ASAP. If you could not take vaccine immediately then TAKE IT AS EARLY AS POSSIBLE AT LEAST WITHIN A PERIOD OF ONE MONTH. Taking vaccine withing first two weeks gives you some chance of sero-conversion as well as disease prevention so for first two weeks are crucial for taking vaccine. After this the probability starts declining but its good to take a chance. There is no guideline on this but personally I think, one should even take vaccine till three months period because that is maximum range of incubation period and vaccine could have some role till that period if you have not shown any symptoms so far."

151,"Hmm, this will be interesting...You and I sound very similar.¬† Contrary to popular belief, I grew up quite the terrified kid.¬† I was afraid to give class presentations, afraid to play in the piano recital, afraid to ask a girl out, afraid to go to the school dance because I didn't have any friends (except the ones I played World of Warcraft with online) and I thought everyone would make fun of me for going, etc.¬† To be honest, I was even afraid to go out to dinner with my family, or to go out anywhere, because I didn't know I had Celiac Disease until I was 18 years old and I constantly, every single day, had a stomach ache and felt like I needed to be close to a bathroom.And then somehow, miraculously, I overcame all of those fears.¬† Every single one.(Posting this photo because humans are visual people and it helps reinforce the story.)But let me tell you a different story, and one that will give you a more clear sense of how to overcome FEAR.One of my biggest fears growing up was expressing myself through my voice.¬† Now, the irony here is that my mom is actually a voice teacher.¬† Yes, she teaches students how to sing and use their voice to express themselves, and here I was dead terrified to open my mouth and say how I truly felt.When I went off to college, I started to get really interested in song writing.¬† I can't explain why, and to be honest I'm sure it was nothing more than a boyish hope that if I could write songs then girls would fall in love with me.¬† But instead of studying the John Mayers of the world, somehow I fell into the rhyme books of 2pac, The Notorious B.I.G., Method Mad, and Eminem.¬† I had always kept a journal growing up so by hobby I was a ""writer,"" but listening to the way they were able to take their words and give them life was, to me, the equivalent of hearing magic.¬† Rap took the silent art of writing and made it REAL.Except there was just one problem...I was beyond, BEYOND terrified to open my mouth and say what I had written on my loose leaf sheet of paper, out loud.¬† The first time I tried, I actually made my freshman year roommate (and now best friend) go to his car with me, and in the pitch black of night I turned on a 2pac song and rapped along with it as loud as I could.¬† In a nutshell, it was like watching a kid try to ride a skateboard for the first time, constantly hitting divots in the ground and rolling over gravel, the board falling out from under him and his face hitting the concrete.¬† I didn't know how to breathe, I was gasping in all the wrong places, I was cutting words short‚ÄîI was trying to imitate one of the greatest rappers of all time so by virtue I sounded like a complete idiot, and above everything else, I made him turn the music so loud that you could barely hear me in the first place‚Äîbecause I was terrified of anyone actually listening to me.¬† (I have these early, early recordings still saved on my computer.¬† I'll release them one day...)When the song was finished I remember pausing the instrumental, turning to him and asking with a wide, hopeful look on my face, ""So?¬† What did you think?""It took everything in him not to tell me that I sounded like I'd been born with turret's syndrome.¬† ""It wasn't too bad!"" he said, and I nodded, wondering if he was telling me the truth.¬† ""You just need to keep practicing,"" he said, and for me that was enough.So I kept practicing.Except I was still so afraid!¬† Jesus, it astounds me now: I practiced in my dorm room closet where (hopefully) nobody would be able to hear me.¬† I practiced by sitting under a blanket with my scalding hot laptop on my lap, trying to insulate my voice and get a clearer sound through my iPod headphones.¬† When I got home from college for the summer I practiced in the old empty storage area in our basement (again under a blanket with my laptop) where I prayed nobody in my family could hear ..."
152,"The thing to know about Red is that she‚Äôs extremely conscious of power plays. While Litchfield offers many opportunities to throw your weight around without them, Red is a student of Vee. All the social promotion given by Ganya and the Russians didn‚Äôt keep Red from entering prison as scared, meek Galina Reznikov. She‚Äôs ‚ÄúRed‚Äù because of Vee. And she doesn‚Äôt let hatred of Vee keep her from learning things from her. Red explicitly forbids drugs. She makes drug use the dividing line between her family and the hillbillies, because Vee was a bloodsucking drug dealer. Red‚Äôs solution to winning her family back is to cook a big special dinner. Why? Because providing wholesome meals for her dixie cups like Taystee and RJ was how Vee kept them from telling her to get fucked when they wised up. By keeping Aydin‚Äôs keys, Red is demonstrating once again why she is Apollo Creed‚Äôs Rocky. Vee‚Äôs number one student.Do you remember the first episode where Piper was about to make her bed and Anita was like DON‚ÄôT MAKE YOUR BED!!!! We‚Äôll do it for you! Piper kept telling her that it was okay, that you all don‚Äôt have to do it, and Anita kept insisting. Well when Anita first moved into the transfer dorm at the same time as Red all those years ago, a woman named Carla did that to Anita, but it seemed so far from being a power play that Anita was just like ‚Äòokay‚Äô. But then Vee came in and waved off Anita‚Äôs suggestion that ‚ÄúCarla‚Äôs gonna wanna do that for you‚Äù on the grounds that ‚ÄúI‚Äôve been around before.‚Äù Anita right then figured out what the situation was, and so did Red who also watched this seemingly innocuous exchange. That‚Äôs right. Piper was hit with a power play in her first day at Litchfield not just from Red with the food, but from Anita DeMarco.The difference between how Red sees things and how more conventional criminal masterminds like Frida sees things is demonstrated this season with those guard‚Äôs keys. Frida was not in the Vee-School-Of-Ways-To-End-Up-Slocked-In-A-Greenhouse, so she takes the keys off Alex and Lolly‚Äôs hands as a simple present, like getting a magic key in Legend of Zelda or something. Red however knows that whoever owns these keys‚Ä¶is more powerful then the other inmates. Because Vee believed that ‚Äúif you have something the girls want, they‚Äôll respect you for it‚Äù, it was this advice that gave Red the perception of power over the others by the time we meet her in Season 1. Red has the contraband trade‚Ä¶and so even Claudette takes her to be someone not to mess with, lest she have to, for instance, obtain and hide her own vial of Mexican vanilla extract."

That species really doesn‚Äôt look all that much like Snoke. You can see in the pictures below that the structure of the head is very different.Plagueis was a Sith. JJ Abrams has stated that Snoke is not a Sith.Abrams stated that Snoke is a new character.

157,"To begin, the tripod isn‚Äôt just a tripod, it is a tripod and a head. The distinction between the 2 parts is important, since you can put a variety of heads on a tripod and have it serve a variety of purposes. A quick search on eBay will reveal the availability of both, with prices ranging easily into the 5 figures.So, the answer to this question depends on what you want to do with your 6D. This is a professional camera and the newest item on Canon‚Äôs full frame list. As such, it takes an amazingly rich photograph. However, it is also a video camera with a full frame sensor, turning out wonderfully shaded and focused video with professional qualities to it.For photography, a smoothly ADJUSTABLE tripod is the trick. The photographer will want to get a variety of angles to serve the purpose of his shot. So, being able to adjust on all axis is what you want out of the head. This will allow you to level your camera without having to level your tripod. If the 6D is anything like the 5Diii, you can get a level to appear on your viewing screen by pushing the ‚Äúinfo‚Äù button twice. This is far more convenient than it sounds; when you're shooting a night landscape, leveling the unit can be more challenging than you can imagine.But if you‚Äôre shooting video, you are probably going to be more concerned with PANNING and tilting smoothly. This is where it helps to have a ‚Äúfluid head.‚Äù The mechanism contains oil and the machine works with a heavy smoothness that is essential to that perfect motion of the camera. Most videographers I know spend a great deal of time practicing pans and tilts with their tripods so the second take of a shot isn‚Äôt being done because of a jump or jerk in the pan.One quality I would watch for is the feet of the tripod. You want a tripod system that can adapt to your location. I‚Äôm a Manfrotto fan, personally. I find their line has a multiplicity of choices for both activities. But there are many brands that make a decent tripod. Get one that can handle the job and the terrain on which you‚Äôre shooting.Good Luck and happy shooting."
158,"Thanks for the A2A, but this question is not significant anymore. Earlier this year (2015), Quora had pulled off the role of Moderators on their website.Now there are ""trusted reporters"" on Quora instead of moderators. All the people who were moderators are by default trusted reporters and they have most of the powers that they used to have when they were moderators. One plus to this arrangement is that now anyone can become a trusted reporter. If a normal user constantly report bad stuff and most of their reports are genuine then they might also become a trusted reporter and will have the power to collapse answers right away.Even though the answers reported by trusted reporters get collapsed right away, they are still sent to the reviewing queue of admins, and admins have to power to revert the operation of a trusted reporter.One difference is that moderators used to have the power to lock and delete questions but trusted reporters do not have this power. Trusted reporters' power is pretty much confined to just the answers written on Quora. But yes, their reports carry significant weight and given higher priority than a normal user's reports.Moderators used to have a separate dashboard which showed the number of answers and topics that need to be reviewed. It also showed the statistics of other moderators, i.e, how many topics and answers top 5 moderators have reviewed in a particular month."

He simply assumed that I did indeed own a handgun because the British seem to believe that ALL Americans have handguns. And, he wanted to see it. So, I showed it to him - My S&W 686 Plus.

Maybe I‚Äôll catch a Clapton concert there.‚Ä¶to visit the Tower of London‚Ä¶do a pub crawl with friends for a pint of stout in each place‚Ä¶to visit the place where they video Top Gear (maybe I‚Äôll get to meet the Stig)‚Ä¶to attend a race at Brands Hatch‚Ä¶take a ride in a Hackney carriage‚Ä¶answer the age-old Jethro Tull question: ‚ÄúWas it really true there are elephants and lions too in Picadilly Circus?‚Äù LOL‚Ä¶take a selfie at that spot where the Beatles made their Abbey Road album cover‚Ä¶to interview some Brits about just what all this fuss is about Brexit?‚Ä¶to drive a right-hand drive MG or Austin Healey on some British country roads.‚Ä¶take a ride on the Romney, Hythe and Dymchurch Railway‚Ä¶take a ride in a double decker bus‚Ä¶buy, borrow or steal a black Mac for a souvenir‚Ä¶learn and commit to memory all of the derogatory slang terms for Americans and use them to develop a beautiful bag of snappy comebacks. LOL I mean, hey! It‚Äôs all in fun - right? (I already know that I am NOT a tosser)‚Ä¶to visit the Imperial War Museum and the Churchill War Rooms in London.‚Ä¶to pay respect to all those Brits and Americans who lost their lives in that dammed war.‚Ä¶to show the greatest respect and friendship to any and all I meet and to make many new friends while gaining a lifetime‚Äôs worth of new memoriesI think that this is a pretty good list for a start. I‚Äôll work on it some more."
163,"Twitter has been one of the easiest way to promote Business and I made more sales on Twitter than any other Social Media Business Accounts!Complete your profile (don‚Äôt forget to input your website, it‚Äôs really important to drive traffic to your site.)DO NOT BUY FOLLOWERS. I‚Äôve read a lot that you should buy followers in order to gain followers easier. However, based on my experience, buying followers is a bad move to your business! It looks good on your profile having huge followers but it will have no engagement and it will be hard for you to find and communicate well to your real followers! Most of the success stories on building an empire on twitter is a consistent effort of following real people and hope for a followback. Follow 500 people/day, after 4‚Äì5 days, unfollow people who didn‚Äôt follow you back. Rinse. Repeat.BEWARE ON AUTOMATION. I tried manual direct messaging when I gained new followers and I received great and fast replies and a real interaction. I got tired on manual so I used a tool, crowdfire to be exact. It‚Äôs a good tool but it looks unprofessional because I was only using the free account so it has -@crowdfire at the end of my message. Since I did auto direct messaging, I didn‚Äôt get any replies, and if I did, it‚Äôs a promotion of other people and I never get an interaction. :( So, always beware on automating things, if you want to remove the -@crowdfire, you should pay for the tool to make it look personal message to your gained followers.FOCUS on type of your tweets. Will you tweet a ‚Äútext‚Äù, ‚Äúpicture‚Äù, ‚Äúinfographics‚Äù? If you are planning to tweet a text, be consistent, if you‚Äôre going to tweet picture, be consistent, as well as on infographics. Focus on that. Mix tweets doesn‚Äôt look good on timeline and you‚Äôre sending people away on your timeline. Make it look better. Let‚Äôs say you want to tweet picture, maybe you can do it once or twice a week if you‚Äôre tweeting text.DO NOT BE TOO SALES-Y.INTERACT A LOT. Interact with your followers as much as you can. reply to them when they tweeted you.REACH INFLUENCERS. Follow influencers in your industry. Mention them on your tweets. Talk to them.USE TOOLS. As I mentioned above, I failed on using tool because I wasn‚Äôt willing to pay for the tool. If you want to automate things, you must be willing to pay for it to make your message looks personal. Use hootsuite to schedule your tweets at once.BE PERSONAL. Be yourself. Do not send long messages. Just keep it short simple and make yourself feel like you are just having a conversation and sales will take care of itself."

168,"Curiosity is the key to passionIf any student would have asked any individual, which platform is best to have my engineering. Then, the advancement of the field would never had been possible. The actual thing that matters is your interest.Even though, if someone suggest you a field in engineering. At, long run you would find that things are not in the way you wanted. There are enormous example, where the students from prestigious institutions went for Computer science & engineering as its pays well. As they were good at PCM, they manage to secure very good rank.But, PCM can't decide whether you will also be good at coding stuffs. At that time, computer system is not going to listen that, ‚Äú hey! I'm from this prestigious institution‚Ä¶ Make my codes compile or interpret‚Äù.And even though when they manage to secure a seat in Mnc‚Äôs. But again in long run, when the organization doesn't found them eligible. They kick them out, without the second justification. And believe me, the number of cases related to the above mentioned is really recognizable.So, coming back to question,First ask yourself, whether you really want that Er. tag, or as because the rest of the world is doing the same. So, you are also following the mob. If, No then do the following :Explore about multiple feilds of engineering yourself.Gather information about the life at that field.What are it's scope in coming future.If possible earn experience about that field from your kins.And, after examine of all the data and figures.

There is more to it then just attraction because it is what you learned to love.There is another really important facet to this issue.

Not in a literal way of course, but they will sense that you are ‚Äòavailable‚Äô to them ‚Äúto be abused‚Äù when they get to know you.This has everything to do with the way you are.

171,"Christianity like anyother religion is result of a lot of build up stories and extensive marketing by authoritative people. And when it comes to Kerala there are too many fairy tales , miracles and big budget Orthodox, Protestant and Catholic churches than anyone can imagine on a comparatively smaller locality. I personally don't think the story behind the Nasrani or Syrian/St Thomas Christians origin has got any proof to substantiate . There is no proof either if there was an apostle named St.Thomas ever existed in the first place. Almost all people of the early AD's were named exactly the same and some guy named Thomas might have preached some form of Christianity (or more precisely some Jewish mixed Christianity among some of the early localites of Kerala). There is fake story that namboothiri brahmins got converted to christians . Why should the privileged brahmins of that time willever be interested in Christianity, Most likely a bunch of lower caste people might have voluntarily came to Christianity due to the class intolerance existed at those times.All these Christian denominations are highly irritating because they altogether made the principles we stand for look too complicated , created a lot of divisions , sub divisions, classes & virtual partitions among themselves and the original version of what God actually said (if he ever did say something to so called only ancient people) is ultimately lost among the goofed up people made stories.All in the name of power and money, nothing else."

175,"PIMCO's Income Fund (managed by the firm's CIO Dan Ivascyn) is one of the top performing bond funds with consistent track record.¬† Many industry folks came to (begrudgingly) respect Ivascyn's leadership after seeing how the fund consistently bounce back to life following adverse market conditions.¬† For example, one would see PIMCO funds getting decimated (on a single day basis) after a Payrolls report surprised on the downside (PIMCO was positioned for an above-consensus print), but they would somehow manage to narrow the gap once more and carried on with renewed momentum (to the disappointment of its many competitors)Many investors have good things to stay about Jeff Gundlach's DBLTX DoubleLine Total Return Bond Fund.¬† I respect Mr. Gundlach and especially portfolio manager Jeffrey Sherman (I took his bond math class), but some have lingering concerns on the sustainability of Doubleline's investment strategy.Mr. Gundlach managed to buy large quantities of non-agency mortgage-backed security during the 2008 crisis, when they were at fire sale prices.¬† These assets have high carry, and Mr. Gundlach's extensive experience in MBS (he is a great investor) allowed him to capture these cash flows and watch these bonds surge back to life as the housing crisis turned into recovery.¬† The question being: these high carry bonds will eventually run off and Doubleline will need to find another miracle to compete against other funds.¬† I believe Doubleline can pull it off, but that is still different than Mr. Ivascyn who is ""pulling it off"" on a daily basis."

177,"They are both my favourite actors hands down. They are extremely talented and charismatic. How can anyone choose? It is a matter of opinion at the end of the day as talent in acting cannot be measured objectively like singing. If a singer does not perform well it is evident, everone can hear imperfections in singing, even those who are not musically trained. But, when it comes to acting, how can anyone chose? If i have to choose one however that would be Al Pacino. Why?Robert Deniro is a very talented actor as well as hard working . When he takes a role he throws himself at work to become that character in every single way. He is very dedicated and very commited to every project he takes, at least in the beginning of his career he was because later he wasted his talent on average movies. When he starred in Godfather 2, for which he deservedly won an oscar, he spent 3 months in Sicily to master Vito Corleone‚Äôs accent. Not the Italian accent, the sicilian accent!! When he did Raging Bull he actually took boxing classes, he put on weight to look like his character, he trained hard to have a boxer‚Äôs body. When he starred at taxi driver he actually drove a taxi on night shifts in New York to be convincing. Meryl Streep and Joe Pesci have both stated he is a perfectionist and he has an eye for the detail. He studies hard his character, he always does his homework. No doubt about that, he is serious about his craft, he takes his roles personally.However, Al Pacino works with his instinct. He does not visit his character‚Äôs hometown to understand him. It comes natural to him. For instance, when he did the Scarface he did not need to go to Cuba to master Montana‚Äôs accent. He killed it anyway, even if the accent was not 100% accurate. When he played the junkie in Panic in the needle park he did not spend hours on the streets with drug addicts to study their mannerisms but the man slayed. When he starred in Justice for all he did not start studying law books to convice us as an attorney. He did any way. Al Pacino‚Äôs performances in the Godfather 1, the Godfather 2, dog day afternoon, Panic in the needle park, Justice for all and even Scarface just SLAY. It is poetry, pure magic. He doesn‚Äôt exaggerate, he doesn‚Äôt scream, he doesn‚Äôt manipulate the viewer, he is honest. He plays from his heart. Though i do admire De niro‚Äôs commitment to his roles on every level- body tranformation, accent - i believe Pacino acts more naturally and more effortlessly. He is a born actor.It is a very tough choice indeed but if i have to choose one i ‚Äòll go with Pacino every day."

There's always something new and the endless scrolling tricks our brains to keep going.My tips for minimizing phone use:DELETE SOCIAL MEDIA APPS. unless you're making money off social media, you're just another hamster in the wheel being fed glittered up bs. There's no point in social media! If you were hot shit, people would know your name either way. Does your sister in law or old best friend from college REALLY need a like from you for them to know you care? Step your relationships up then in real life!Turn it off during school/work. You can get a nice 3‚Äì5 hr block without a phone. There's nothing that important that you need to have it on during a time when you should be focusing/studying. And most people just go on another endless screen anyway, like a laptop or computer for school/work. Another distraction but at least it's one less screen in your face.Uninstall the apps you haven't even opened since you downloaded it.Try not to make your phone your convenient, all-in-one device. Unless youre always traveling and need things to be as simple as possible, stop giving power to a device by putting your life on it. Pick up a REAL book or print out that ebook to read. Most of us aren't that busy that we need to be like Kris Jenner managing 15 different people and deals.This one is most controversial, but‚Ä¶become a bad texter. Let people get used to you responding to their messages after a while. Being a trained monkey responding to your phone within a few seconds makes it easier to break your concentration and thoughts for real life. Of course, be there for someone when they need it or asking you time-sensitive questions. You'll find that the people who pick up conversations as if nothing happened are some of the best people you'll EVER met and keep them close!!Any mindless activity that can make an hour pass by like it's nothing is threatening to your goals and plans. When was the last time you were able to pick up a book and end up reading for 10+ minutes because you got lost in it? It's definitely been a while for me, but just this morning I spent 30minutes reading sports news before I even got up to use the bathroom after waking.Be mindful of your time and the endless black mirror in your hands!"

Both app and the website. I just couldn't figure out the problem. I even contacted the ISP and there was no solution. After a lot of thinking, I realized it might have been due to the change in DNS Servers so instead of using OpenDNS, I opted for Google DNS Servers and guess what?

185,"The significance of the Battle of the Somme is that for many it signifies the senseless waste and slaughter of the First World War. Towards the end of 1915 the Allied commanders on the Western Front held a meeting in which they would determine the direction the Allies would take in the next year. They agreed that there would be a joint Anglo-French offensive spanning either side of the Somme river while simultaneous offensive would take place on the Italian and Eastern front. Meanwhile the German high command had their own plan which Falkenhayn came up with. Falkenhayn had realised that Germany‚Äôs main enemy in the war is Britain because even if they could beat the French they would still have to cross the channel which was impractical given the Royal navies dominance at seas, so Falkenhayn realised that to win he had to knock England‚Äôs best sword out of her hand as he phrased and beat the French. To do this he would attack and capture Verdun and then let the French bleed themselves white trying to take it back. On 21st February Falkenhayn launched his offensive with an enormous barrage by 1200 guns in a small narrow sector. Within two days the Germans had fired 2 million shells and then they attacked . The attack was successful in some areas and difficult in other areas. As a result of this attack the French began pouring more and more divisions into the Verdun down the road they would christen the Sacred way. As more and more french division were sucked into a wilderness of shell craters and blood they realised that they would not be able to fully support the offensive on the Somme as planned and as a result the offensive became largely a British affair. Over the next few months as the bloodbath at Verdun continued huge numbers of British troops from the New army or Kitchener‚Äôs army as they were called began to flood into Amiens in preparation as well as huge numbers of shells being stockpiled. The Germans could not fail to notice this so they began to prepare accordingly. In the week leading up to the 1st of July (the set start of the offensive) the Britsh artillery began to rain down shells day and night on the German lines day and night without end. During the week of shelling 1.5 millions shells were fired however at least 1/3rd of all shells failed to explode which would have tragic consequences on the 1st of July as the wire would remain uncut. On the 1st of July 1916 the offensive began at 7:30 in the morning with 5 divisions of French troops on the south side of the Somme, 11 British divisions of General Rawlinson‚Äôs 4th army and 2 divisions of the British third army opposite Gommecourt. At the same time mines were blown all along the front with two notable mines blown being at Hawthorn ridge and the Lochnagar crater. 150 000 men along and 18 mile front emerged from their trenches and walked in some places and ran in others. The Germans upon hearing the artillery stop knew the time for the attack had come and emerged from their dugouts in which they hidden from the bombardment, and began setting up their machine guns. Across the field of no man‚Äôs land they could see line after line of British infantry marching forward and could not have asked for better targets. The advancing British were mown down in droves. An example of the slaughter is the attack made by the Newfoundland regiment that were attacking Beaumont Hamel in the Norther sector of the battlefield. Out of a regiment of 750 men who attacked only 68 could answer muster the next day. To the north of the Albert Bapaume upon which the offensive was taking place the attacks achieved nothing but horrendous casualties while South of the road there were some limited successes while the french sector saw a quick advance that got bogged down. At the end of the day the casualties had been horrific with the British suffering 57 000 casualties of which 19 000 were killed..."

So the ‚Äúdrug makers‚Äù pharmacists and drug delivery scientists, have to make sure that the drugs, in their drop formulation, will penetrate into the eye sufficiently to provide a high enough concentration within the eye to be effective, while staying dissolved within an aqueous solution that does not burn or irritate the eye when dropped into the eye, is stable in solution for a reasonable amount of time (think commercial shelf life), and not likely to get contaminated. Not an easy job! (This question would be better answered by someone - pharmacist or scientist who has actually worked in this field; it's really ‚Äúout of my pay grade‚Äù).So tear film compatibility, and resistance to dilution by the tear film becomes important. If I make a great eye drop, but it stings like crazy when patients put it in their eye, what do you think happens? One, compliance goes down - patients won't use it as often as they should, and tear secretion dilutes the medication and washes it away. So, great drug, but not very effective.So the real question is not ‚Äúwhat happens when eye medication gets into the eye‚Äù , but how to get eye medications into the eye effectively and safely.Addendum: some eye drops are not supposed to penetrate into the inside of the eye, like artificial tears; and they don't. Injecting artificial tears into the eye would probably cause a severe inflammatory reaction. Don't try this at home kids."
188,"Instead of a yes or no answer, I‚Äôd like to introduce you to Story Musgrave.Haven‚Äôt heard of him? Aside from being a NASA Astronaut, Story has spent equal time in his life as a Marine, Doctor, Designer, Engineer, Artist, Mathematician, Speaker and Consultant. He holds six formal academic degrees, not because he was chasing credentials, but because he found them fascinating.His started his journey studying for an MA in Music and Biology in Massachusetts, before dropping out to join the marines. He served in Korea as an aircraft crew chief while completing duty assignments aboard the carrier USS Wasp in the Far East. Here, he discovered his passion for flying, which he kept with him for life, flying over 17,700 hours in 160 different types of civilian and military aircraft (oh, and he‚Äôs skydived 800 times too).After the marines, Story received a B.S. degree in Mathematics and Statistics from Syracuse University in 1958, an MBA degree in Operations Analysis and Computer Programming from the University of California, Los Angeles in 1959, and a B.A. degree in Chemistry from Marietta College in 1960. In between these academic stints, Story worked as a mathematician and operations analyst for Kodak Film in New York.After that got boring, he decided to become a doctor. He completed an M.D. from Columbia University in 1964, and an M.S. in Physiology and Biophysics from the University of Kentucky in 1966 (for good measure). Story practiced on a part-time basis at Denver General Hospital and was an instructor of physiology and biophysics at the University of Kentucky. During this time, he wrote or co-authored twenty five scientific papers in the areas of aerospace medicine and physiology.Logically, Story decided it was time to go to space and become an astronaut. And so he did. A veteran of six space flights, Musgrave has spent a total of 1,281 hours, 59 minutes, 22 seconds on space missions, including nearly 27 hours of EVA. He is also the only astronaut to have flown on all five Space Shuttles, and was one of the oldest people to ever orbit the earth, at the tender age of 61.Bonus: Somehow, during all of this, Story managed to fit in one last degree in Literature from the University of Houston in 1987."
189,"Christian Bale, without a doubt.Before all the Bat-Fleck fans out there start raging out there, yes, I know the direction was crappy from The dawn of justice and that might be the reason for Ben Affleck‚Äôs appalingly dull portrayal as our favorite superhero. Nevertheless, had it been Christian Bale in his place, he would have pulled it off will all the awesomeness that Batman really is.See, in the Dark Knight Trilogy, Batman was cool, composed and amazing. Yes, most credit goes to Nolan‚Äôs direction of the film and the glorious effects. But Bale knew how to pull it off, he didn‚Äôt bring out a wimpy, talkative aid to Batman‚Äôs character like Affleck so negatively did.And yes, people would say that Affleck‚Äôs portrayal was like the ‚Äúreal batman‚Äù as in the one in the comics but in that case it is wrong as well. Affleck‚Äôs portrayal of the ‚Äúreal Batman‚Äù was quite not upto the mark either. ‚ÄúThe real Batman‚Äù was played perfectly only by Michael Keaton in the 1989 movie.Affleck was neither here nor there. He really just blew the whole thing up. His action was so dull, I literally stopped watching Dawn of Justice midway. On the other hand, to this very day, I watch the Dark Knight trilogy over and over again.To add to my answer, I have a bit of proof here:The first image is to prove that I didn't google for ‚ÄúChristian Bale the best Batman or something like that‚ÄùBusiness Insider is a plausible site and also the first option that google gave. So, take a look:So, there you have it! Clearly Bale is the better Batman."

As well as training programmes and first-hand support, most franchisors help find and retain customers and assist with setting up accounting or stock control systems.Most importantly, your franchisor will offer financial help in getting the business off the ground. Many help with your initial start-up costs, such as equipment or vehicles, as well as organising marketing and advertising campaigns.The level of assistance varies according to the franchisor ‚Äì some have 24-hour-a-day helplines, others have representatives on hand for quick visits to solve various problems. Either way, franchisees are not left to struggle alone.even if you are an experienced business owner, there are numerous benefits to starting a low cost business. But it‚Äôs important to keep in mind that there are many factors to consider besides just ‚Äúaffordability‚Äù when evaluating a franchise. If you‚Äôve done your research already, then you know that many franchises, such as restaurants and fast foodestablishments, can cost hundreds of thousands or even millions of dollars. This makes it extremely difficult for cash-strapped entrepreneurs to start their own business.If you are looking for a more affordable business, without a huge investment, then low cost franchises aredefinitely the way to go.Franchise business is on fire these days, my ideas for best franchise as looking forward to this period of time is the company, who is achieving success day by day because of their working ethics and responsibility of fulfilling there customers needs at time. The best franchise I would like you take is Phixman. One of the most intruiging firm in India.They are best because :-Significant capital required.Large overhead.Borrowed capital utilized must be repaid.Large time & expense requirements.Management problems related to span of control, supervision demands, difficulty in hiring and maintaining competent managers.Phixman.

191,"A short story.Mulla loved his wife so much. One day he found that his wife‚Äôs hearing ability is getting worse. So he wanted to cure her issue without his knowledge. So he went to a doctor and explains the situation. The doctor agrees to help with one condition. The doctor said I can help but I want to know how bad is your wife‚Äôs hearing ability so check from at what distance your wife can hear you.So Mulla started his process. When he returned home he found his wife to be in the kitchen. So from outside of the house, he shouted, What are you cooking today, there was no reply. So he went outside the kitchen and asked the same question even for this there is no reply. He was shocked. So he decided to go near to her and asked in front of her face.After hearing this, his wife slapped Mulla hard and said, at the first time itself I told you that I was cooking roti today. Then Mulla found it was not his wife‚Äôs hearing problem which is weak, actually, it‚Äôs his own hearing ability which is weaker.We are like this, for our problem we are complaining about others. So the only solution is to stop asking questions. Because ten questions arise from an answer. It is your imagination that is the root cause of possessiveness. Stop being a slave to your own imagination.Peace."

God forbid you don‚Äôt clear CAfor 3/4/5 years then you atleast have a stable career and job alongside. or it is anyways a value add over and above CA.I would recommend - why not do a specialised certification in something like Risk Management.The demand for Risk Managers is growing and is about 10,000 professionals in just India.Top Consulting firms such as Big 4 hire about 5,000 Professionals / Fresehers for Risk Consulting and train them on the job.

198,"This is a technique known as 'shadowing' that I learnt in Japanese class, which I find tremendously helpful for short-term oral fluency improvement.Watch your favorite English language TV show or movie, and as the characters speak, repeat loudly the exact words they are saying the moment you hear them. In other words, 'shadow' their dialogue in real-time. Don't worry about getting every word or sound right - focus on listening carefully, moving along quickly and keeping pace. After the movie ends, repeat the exact same movie and do it again. And again.By forcing yourself to speak at native speed, your brain becomes hyper-receptive to what you are hearing, and you will find yourself not only picking up the words quicker and quicker, but also unconsciously mimicking the inflections and vocal nuances that are usually difficult to learn for a non-native. It will also fix the stammer that comes with uncertainty or lack of confidence. In this way, the actors in the movie become your speaking partners.This will be perfect practice just before your interview. Look for some interview practice videos on YouTube, then shadow the entire conversation. Practice the same dialogs again and again. You will be amazed how that will improve not only your speaking, but also your ability to actively listen and react. Best of luck."
199,"I strongly disagree with most of the answers here. Don‚Äôt let ‚Äúso called economists‚Äù mislead you who says after demonetization of 500/1000 rupees notes, the real estate sector will go down, without correcting your facts.People are claiming that real estate industry involves the maximum amount of black money, and as there will be shortage of black money after government‚Äôs bold decision, the demand for the properties will reduce. And as the demand supply graph works, lower demand means lower prices. The thing you are missing here is, real estate sector is not just about black money and pricing system in an industry is not just about demand and supply relation.We can divide this industry in majorly two parts to understand the effects of currency ban:1. Agriculture land and individual plots: These are the two types of properties which might see the downfall.These properties are generally bought long back with a very lesser amount compared to the present rates, so the prices of these two types of properties are completely depended on the market value. So if the market value of any property decreases, automatically the price of that property will decrease. Now since these properties involve the maximum amount of black money, shortage of black money will reduce the number of potential buyers from market, reducing market value, finally reducing the prices.2. All the other type of properties (Commercial office spaces, apartments, developer plots, villas etc.)These types of properties involve negligible or no black money. So the reduction of black money will have minimum effect on the demand of these types of properties.Secondly prices of these are not just depended on the market demand. A huge amount is first invested by builders to develop the property. So in these cases margins on invested amount plays a major role in deciding the property‚Äôs price. Since the real estate market has already been witnessing recession since last 3 years, builders have reduced their margins to the lowest. So there is no further scope of price reductions as no businessman will sell his product with a loss. The prices may stay still, but will not see downfall for sure.The mentioned points are the cases when the demand stays the same as before or goes down. But we should notice here that since the banks will be flooded with cash after government‚Äôs decision of demonetization of 500/1000 rupees notes, the loan process will be eased and the interest rates will be reduced. These properties were already being transacted without any black money, and now since there would be easy home loans at lower interest rates, demand of these properties might even INCREASE.So guys please correct your facts and stop believing everything you read. This time is the best time to buy property. The prices may not go up in a short span, but these will not go down for sure."
200,"I was raised with a lot of privilege. I‚Äôm not trying to deny it. But you know what the massive side dish is that comes with privilege? Delusion. You always expect more food to magically appear on your plate, without so much as leaving the table.One of the most common, yet most dangerous illusions my generation secretly indulges in is the idea of becoming a billionaire.Go ahead. Feel it. Deep down. It‚Äôs there.‚ÄúI‚Äôll become a billionaire.‚ÄùAs if it was just a matter of when. If you just felt a slight tingle, I have a few questions for you. Questions for future billionaires.1. What‚Äôs your good reason for wanting to make a billion?I like David Blaine‚Äôs idea that success is giving as much as you get.He says what makes Bill Gates so great is that he‚Äôs figured out how to give the money he‚Äôs amassed to worthy causes better than most institutions can. Polio‚Äôs almost eradicated. Next, he‚Äôs going after Guinea worm disease.If the only place you want to direct the money is into your own pocket, you‚Äôll never think broad enough to reach a billion.‚ÄúTo make a billion dollars, help a billion people.‚Äù ‚Äì Peter Diamandis2. What‚Äôs your real reason for wanting to make a billion?Now that we‚Äôve got the noble cause out of the way, why do you really need the money? What happiness can a billion buy you that 100 million can‚Äôt? That 10 million can‚Äôt? That one million can‚Äôt?It‚Äôs just another arbitrary number. What‚Äôs not arbitrary is the psychological hole you‚Äôre hoping it‚Äôll fill. Where‚Äôs the hole?Are you insecure? Lonely? Do you lack self-worth? Self-love? Who do you want to prove wrong? Yourself? The world?It‚Äôs okay. Just like the idea of becoming a billionaire itself, when you dig deep enough, you‚Äôll realize it‚Äôs there. We all have it. But know it‚Äôs there.‚ÄúThere‚Äôs always a good reason and there‚Äôs always a real reason.‚Äù ‚Äì James Altucher3. How are you going to make your billion?Seriously. Do the math. The real, serious math. We‚Äôre not talking about revenue here. We‚Äôre talking about profit. Profit you can pocket.What does a billionaires bank account even look like? Is there ever a billion on there? I have no idea. And neither do you.Only 3% of billionaires made their money from running private companies. Can you take a company from zero to IPO? How big is your total market? Is there even a billion in there?‚ÄúIf past history was all there was to the game, the richest people would be librarians.‚Äù‚Äì Warren Buffett4. Who‚Äôs going to make your billion for you?That‚Äôs right. Not with you. For you. You have to be aware that in the end, that‚Äôs what‚Äôs happening. Everyone you hire along your journey will partly be responsible for making your billion. And you will hire people. You have to.These people will work with you. But they‚Äôll make money for you. Tell me: Why should they? Tell them. You better have a compelling reason. A good offer.What are you going to give back? What are you going to do for them?‚ÄúHelp young people. Help small guys. Because small guys will be big.‚Äù ‚Äì Jack Ma5. When do you expect your billion?If the answer is anything less than 20 years from now, you can stop right here. Warren Buffett became a millionaire just before turning 30. He first was a billionaire at 56. That‚Äôs 26 years, starting from millionaire status.Are you a millionaire yet? No? Whoops. That‚Äôs just the first part. But even that‚Äôs ridiculously hard.And don‚Äôt you dare tell me about Mark Zuckerberg. You‚Äôre not Mark Zuckerberg. Mark Zuckerberg isn‚Äôt reading this. Neither would you be, if you were already seriously working on your billion.‚ÄúI‚Äôm here to build something for the long-term. Anything else is a distraction.‚Äù ‚Äì Mark Zuckerberg6. What are you willing to give up for your billion?If being a billionaire is your number one goal, think about number two. You will not get number two. Or three. Or four. The bigger the goal, the bigger the sacrifice.0.0000272% of all humans are billionaires. They gave up not one, but all the things that make the other 99.99% of people what they are - the other 99.99% of the people.Whatever you think you can also have, next to being a billionaire, you most likely can‚Äôt. We‚Äôre not talking about giving up watching football here.Are you willing to be a bad father for your billion? An absent mother? Are you willing to lose your girlfriend? Or all your friends? Would you give up family? Sleep? Food for a week?Most importantly: Are you willing to give up being understood by every single person you know?‚ÄúI was set free, because my greatest fear had already been realized, and I was still alive, and I still had a daughter whom I adored, and I had an old typewriter and a big idea. And so rock bottom became the solid foundation on which I rebuilt my life.‚Äù ‚Äì J.K. RowlingPrivilege is a sweet syrup. There‚Äôs lots to gain from savoring it.

201,"No, all it does is make serotonin more available in your brain for a while, and maybe alter other neurotransmitters (aka ‚Äúchemical messengers‚Äù) in your nervous system. Of course, your nervous system affects and is affected by all your other systems, and your environment, so it‚Äôs all very complex. What taking Prozac feels like depends on unique things about you and your life circumstances, and as you‚Äôve surely noticed, we are all very different.Be as honest and clear with the doctor who prescribed it. If there‚Äôs no benefit from being on it, the wise thing might be to stop taking it. Much has been written about reasons NOT to use antidepressants, with some very fine minds concluding they don‚Äôt have any benefit, or don‚Äôt have enough benefits to justify the problems with side effects and difficulty (physical, cognitive, and emotional) after people stop taking them.A non-drug-oriented counselor might help you discover whether you have some maladaptive beliefs about social events and dating that are keeping you away from them. People don‚Äôt judge each other as harshly as we sometimes think they do. Remember that other people are shy and self conscious too. If you find yourself feeling nervous at a gathering of some kind, you can ease your suffering by finding another nervous or shy person and starting a conversation. You don‚Äôt have to march up and stare at them and bark out a direct question. It‚Äôs more a matter of being beside them at the punch bowl, samovar, or keg and making a small attempt to communicate. This is doing them a favor, a selfless act on your part, even if it is difficult for you. Ask them if they like parties. They‚Äôll probably laugh out loud and say ‚ÄúNO!

203,"From an anonymous article I recently read on Politicall (link below), this is the best answer I've seen to your question.Consider for a moment that we hate Hillary Clinton because of who she is, what she has done and it has nothing to do with her gender, not even anything to do with the republican delusion syndrome. I‚Äôm going to say it right here and now I hate the Clintons. Both her and Bill and I'm never going to apologize for it. I hate what they did to the democratic party handing the party of the people over to the same corporate masters as the republican party and taking away real choice in the general election. I hate that they dismissed and belittled progressives rendering our causes futile or simply off the table. I hate them for welfare reform and a draconian crime bill that victimized the poor, destroyed entire neighborhoods and disproportionately crushed communities of color. I hate them for trade deals that destroyed the middle class, killed American jobs and sent wages on a race to the bottom. I hate them for de-regulating the media and then ducking behind them for cover on their lies and smears of their political enemies. I hate them for passing Don‚Äôt Ask Don‚Äôt Tell and DOMA and pretending later that they were doing it to save the gay community from something worse. I hate them for saying they want America to take the lead in fighting global warming then taking huge donations from the oil and coal industries, selling fracking to the world, supporting offshore drilling, supporting the extraction and storage of natural gas and opposing a carbon tax‚Ä¶ basically the exact opposite of what someone who cares about stopping or slowing global warming would do. I hate them for being the dirtiest campaigners in modern history. I hate her specifically because her foreign policy of war, regime change and arming the enemy of our enemy has been almost as destructive as Dick Cheney arguably one of the most destructive leaders in our nation‚Äôs history.¬† Yes I hate them and my hatred for them grows with every lie, with every smear and with every media hit piece or every surrogate that goes out spreading lies and false narrative on their behalf. Yes I hate them for who they are and what they have done, I don‚Äôt hate them because the republicans told me to hate them. I don‚Äôt hate her because she is a woman. I hate them because they have done more damage to progressives and progressive ideas while pretending to be progressive than any republican ever could have. I hate them for manipulating other democrats into being their apologists and attacking anyone who didn‚Äôt agree with them or called them on their record or questionable integrity. In ‚Äò92 they promised us that they were a 2 for 1, she then became the only first lady to set up an office in the west wing, but how dare anybody hold her accountable for the damage of their administration. Sure she wants the credit for the short term prosperity that came with the dot com bubble, but doesn‚Äôt want any of the blame for the long term consequences of their wall street deals, free trade agreements, mass incarceration or any of the things I listed above. In 92 they said that they were representing the centrist wing of the party and were ""new democrats"" leading the party into a new era, a third way with centrist democrats who could beat republicans in both the money game and electoral game‚Ä¶ and they they did exactly that, dragging the party to the center, crushed the left and led to a corporatist takeover of the party, a party that now answered to corporate interests but how dare anybody who remembers the left bring that up.Well I admit that I hate them‚Ä¶ but somehow as a defense Hillary says if we hate her, surely we must hate Obama for taking money from wall street, or Kerry or insert name of virtually any corporatist third way Democrat.¬† But wait I don‚Äôt hate Obama. 8 years ago I was doing what her supporters are attacking me for now by defending Obama against her lies, smears and attacks. I defended Obama when she sent out her surrogates to smear him, tell us that he can‚Äôt get anything done, has no experience and has no idea about foreign policy because he disagreed with her hawkish ways. Thanks to their corporate takeover of the democratic party I‚Äôve been forced to support the lesser of two evils every election at nearly every level of government and yes I hate that and blame them. I hate that us progressives have been mocked and dismissed every election cycle while being told that this endless string of middle right corporate democrats are progressive‚Ä¶ but sadly I remember what progressives fight for and against. I remember what it was like when democrats put the people first and answered to the people. I know it makes me angrier but I watched all of this happen in real time and yes I was paying attention. I can‚Äôt pretend to not know what democrats used to get for us and can‚Äôt pretend to not notice that our party has been hijacked.So here we are in the primaries in a year when millennials and Independents along with progressives and yes the fringe racist right are all rising up and demanding representation. We are mocked by the media, ignored by the media and scolded by the establishment desperate to hold onto the power they stole from us. We are scolded for ignoring their dirty games, conventional wisdom and establishment bullying. I‚Äôve been involved in progressive politics for 25 years and I know this is the primaries. I know what that means,¬† this is when we get to decide the direction of our party. This is when we get to choose someone who represents real positive change and not the least offensive of the corrupt two party system. This is when we get to remember we have a democracy and that our leaders probably could and should represent the interests of the people.This is when we can send the Clintons into retirement and let both them and their corrupt corporatist leaders know that we are done with oligarchy (a small group of people having control of a government) and plutocracy (government by the wealthy elite and ruling class), we are ready to get our democracy back. This is when we refuse to take no for an answer, when the people can be told she is 20 points up 2 days before the vote and that it‚Äôs over, but they decide to ignore the media noise, ignore the party insiders and send Bernie to one of the biggest primary upsets in political history. This is when we can embrace real change. This is when we can ignore the so called experts that say because she crushed it in southern red states that there is no path to victory for another democrat even though most states including virtually every large state has still not voted. I don't ever want to be told I have to vote for the lesser of two evils.This is when we save democracy, save our planet and remind democrats of our progressive past. This is when we defeat¬† Hillary Clinton and not because she is a woman, but because she is a wolf in sheep‚Äôs clothing who has done enough damage and we are done with both the Bush‚Äôs and the Clinton‚Äôs. This when we start a political revolution that wins back our party, wins back our government, wins back American jobs and restores the American dream. This is when we embrace a truly inspirational leader like Bernie Sanders and we turn the page on a 4 decade attack on the American people by the people we called our leaders. This is when we remind ourselves and the younger generations what it‚Äôs like to be truly great again. Once in a lifetime a truly transformational leader comes along speaking the truth, inspiring the masses and changes the world. Let's not blow it. Vote for real change, vote for honesty and integrity, vote for vision and compassion. Vote for Bernie Sanders and don't let your party, your parents party or the media talk you out of it, or convince you it can't happen. Make it happen. #FeelTheBernIt‚Äôs not us, it‚Äôs her - And you can't shame us for not supporting Hillary, not in the primaries"
204,"In this era of globalization, we see both wife and husband are working full-time. Simultaneously running their houses with a great responsibility on their shoulders. without considering employment as an extra burden or a hindrance to raise their kids or to do household activities. To answer your question, I shall elucidate more on the accuracy of this statement.To begin with, we live in a world that's very fast moving and extremely competitive. So, as a result, resting is not an option for us. When it's very evident that in a family it's imperative to have both men and women work, on the other hand, it becomes equally crucial to have their household chores to be shared among them equally.Secondly, In my opinion, this way of sharing the household activities will not only help develop a great bond between husband & wife. Also, it helps in understanding each other's immensely and therefore it can give rise to another benefit of giving appropriate time to their kids at homes. Be it whatever task they are confronted with, the whole idea of having a companion and helping each other in their every day mundane stuff is the whole idea of starting a life together.For instance, let's take my own example where both my mother & father were full-time employees in government and private sectors respectively. Nevertheless, how much ever the circumstances looked crucial to them, never did they fail me or themselves in raising me or taking care of my dire needs by sharing their home-related activities in parallel.In a nutshell, I completely agree and support the statement that the ""household duties can and ought to be shared among men & women"" and there's absolutely nothing wrong in doing so whatsoever."
205,"Question: Is atheism the lack of belief in gods, or a claim that god does not exist?Answer: This question has been asked repeatedly on Quora and the answers are always the same.¬† I will risk sounding rude by asking you why did you not search for this question before posting it as a question?¬†I suggest you start by reading Rob and Mangesh Urankar answers as they are quite informative to the general perspective of Atheism.¬†My answer is that Atheism does not have a definitive set of rules that all Atheists must abide to.¬† There are some Atheist that make a positive claim that no god or gods exists.¬† They base this on the probability (as shown by credible, verifiable and independently obtainable or observable contradictory evidence and the complete lack of supportive evidence) being so close to zero that the concept of a god is irrelevant. These would fall under the Gnostic Atheist label (although there are other labels as well and how one defines themselves is much more important then how others define or label them, including myself).¬†There is another group of Atheist who would fall under the Agnostic Atheist label.¬† This is the group I would belong to.¬† As stated above, each individual has the absolute right to define this label as they see it in relationship to themselves not to others.¬† My personal definition, which I have posted on numerous questions like this one, defines my stance on this issue.¬† ¬†I do not claim knowledge that no god or gods do not exist (I accept the possibility that somewhere in this vast universe there could be an entity that would fit the basic definition of a god) but based on the contradictory evidence (credible, verifiable and independently obtainable or observable) and due to the lack of supportive evidence I see no reason to accept the existence of any god or gods (I accept that the Probability of the existence of any god is sufficiently close enough to zero to disbelieve a claim of its existence). The short version is I accept the possibility but not the probability that any god exists based on the above criteria of evidence, both contradictory and supportive.¬†If pressed by an individual about a particular god, I ask for the attributes that they believe their god has.¬† I ask for proof of these attributes, not hearsay evidence from scriptural texts.¬† When they inevitably ask me if I can disprove their god(s) existence, I first say that the burden of proof does not lie with me as I am not making a positive claim just stating a lack of belief in their claim.¬† I will then say if I can disprove one attribute of their god as they described it to me, will they accept this as evidence that the god they described does not exist.¬† They may say yes but in truth they will not.¬† They have allowed their Truth to become their Perception.¬† It is relatively easy to take an attribute assigned to a god and offer concrete contradictory evidence but it is pointless to do so. ¬†If there is a god or gods out there, they have no impact on our life's, they do not intervene and prevent negative actions from occurring (both natural events and events in their name) and thus they are completely irrelevant.¬† An irrelevant god is no better then a non-existent god.¬†Now, as I stated above, other Atheist will describe their Atheism in accordance to their own stance.¬† Some will agree with my stance and others will take a different stance.¬† The only unifying statement that all Atheist have is that we do not believe the veracity of the Theist's claim that their god, among all the gods, is real and all other gods are false."
206,"I was with a group of students who sat down with him for about an hour last November.¬† We were touring the Silicon Valley and meeting with a lot of founders and investors - including Jack Dorsey at Square.All of us students were seated around a conference table and chatting and joking with each other, but as soon as he walked in, the whole room went dead silent.¬† Usually, when we met with founders they would greet us as soon as they walked in, but he said absolutely nothing as he walked in and sat down at his chair. He just sat there and looked at us for a little while.When he finally started talking, he was very soft spoken and calm whereas most successful founders I've met are loud and animated.¬† But the weird thing is that he has this really powerful, magnetic presence.¬† I think everyone in the room was totally captivated by him.¬† If you ever talk to Mark Zuckerberg, it feels like talking to a regular person.¬† Not so with Jack Dorsey - he had this kind of charisma that I've never gotten from anyone else."

210,"If Hillary Clinton could not continue her Presidential campaign how would the Democratic Party choose a new candidate?The DNC would quickly appoint another candidate, probably by informal teleconferencing, and delegate the final decision and announcement to the DNC Chairperson. Clinton‚Äôs running mate, Tim Kaine, would receive first consideration. I think.True, the full DNC consists of over 200 members in 50 states, but most likely the quorum for an emergency meeting is only a small fraction of the full list.The DNC is not terribly transparent online, but it may also be the case that the committee gives it‚Äôs Chairperson emergency authority between conventions."

But, considering your previous experience with Royal Enfield, Duke is completely different.My experience: I use Duke for commuting 40kms daily. Frankly, I would say that Duke is not that much comfortable. Yes that is because of the seat. But, I know this disadvantage before buying my bike. My needs are power and acceleration, which is abundant in the Duke.Also, I always drive alone, meaning without any pillion. So I don't have any problems with the pillion seat (upto now\U0001f609), the pillion seat is poor in design and will make your pillion feel uncomfortable. So, I would advice you to go for a test ride and then make an appropriate decision.Thank You."

214,"As a baseline it should always be. Drawing is great fun when you do it as a means of exploration; of your own mind, the medium, the concepts of form etc, however it can be a dread as well, in particular when you try to draw complex images without having the appropriate technique. Example: doodling is great fun. Trying to draw a realistic portrait of your crush while s/he is sitting expectantly waiting to see, is usually not.If drawing isn't fun, change the way you draw: if you're drawing as realistically as you can, taking eons to get the details and shades right, switch it up and try drawing people, trees, that cat, whatever in no more than one minute. Then again under half a minute. Once again in ten seconds. It's hard at first, but you improve fast, which is motivating.Try drawing caricatures, things with absurd proportions, multiple things on top of eachother: a whale that is a salad bowl when viewed from a different perspective, which is a dragon viewed from another. Escher is a master of this.Find artists you like within different styles, explore styles you don't like initially: why do others like it? Can you learn from their way of drawing, and leave out whatever it is that didn't appeal to you?Make mathematical drawings, ViHart is a great inspiration for this, and shamelessly promoting myself, I wrote a post about it. If you're only used to drawing people and fruit it might show some of the versatility of the medium.Bottom line let the pencil carry you along instead of trying to make it sketch out the miniscule details, and drawing becomes a lot more fun, and the drawings become a lot better, since they depict a genuine side of yourself, rather than an attempted copy of someone else. Don't be ashamed of drawing dicks either, it's not a maturity contest, it's just for fun."
215,"A Neutron star is a collapsed supernova remnant that is too large to be a White dwarf.¬† And not dense enough to become a Black Hole.In general, compact stars of less than 1.39 M‚òâ (the Chandrasekhar limit) are white dwarfs, whereas compact stars with a mass between 1.4 M‚òâ and 3 M‚òâ (the Tolman‚ÄìOppenheimer‚ÄìVolkoff limit) should be neutron stars. The maximum observed mass of neutron stars is about 2 M‚òâ. The smallest observed mass of a stellar black hole is about 5 M‚òâ, though compact stars with more than 10 M‚òâ will overcome the neutron degeneracy pressure and gravitational collapse will usually occur to produce a black hole.[9] Between 3 M‚òâ and 5 M‚òâ, hypothetical intermediate-mass stars such as quark stars and electroweak stars have been proposed, but none have been shown to exist. The equations of¬† state of matter at such high densities are not precisely known because¬† of the theoretical and empirical difficulties.It's thought that Neutron Stars are indeed composed almost entirely of neutrons, but may have 'quark soup' or other complexities.¬† They definitely exist and some of them are pulsars.¬† Too small to be White Dwarves - which are made up of collapsed matter, still normal atoms.¬† And not black holes either.This is not 100% certain.¬† Some time back, I saw a suggestion that all of the neutrons actually transmute to Strange Particles - see Strangeness."
216,"No. A 3.8 is fine. Harvard regularly accepts students with a 3.8. That may sound surprising because Harvard rejects students with higher GPAs, but a 3.8 isn‚Äôt much different than a 4.0, and most schools don‚Äôt have a 4.3 grading range.The 3.8 student may win out based on SAT scores, extracurriculars, awards, the essay, and personal factors.Even a student with a lower GPA will at least have the other factors looked at, though it may be a quick look. Say a student with a 2.5 applies. What?! Who would dare apply with such a low GPA??? Before rejecting the application, though, the admissions people might see that the student has an SAT of 1540 and spent two of his high school years doing fundraising projects to get medical care for his dad who had cancer, and working to help support the family. He wrote an impressive essay and got letters of recommendation from his teachers confirming his potential and determination.My point is, whatever your GPA, they will look at your entire application and not just reject you based on your GPA."
217,"Well, first of all, look how it works, and then I will tell why you should not try it at all.In classical binary options trading all you have to do is to determine whether the price of a stock or a currency pair will go up or down in a predetermined period. The Put and Call options stay at the core of the whole Binary Options trading process. That is why we will start with these two.Binary Options is a type of options, the basic rule of which is to identify the future direction of the asset price. Consider that you trade on EUR/USDAs you can see in the right side, we have two large buttons: Put and Call.Buying the Call optionIf you consider that the EUR/USD quotation will go above the Strike Price and will end this way at the Expiry Time, then you should buy the Call option and you will have a predetermined profit in case your forecast is correct. Now let‚Äôs see what are the Strike Price and the Expiry Time.The Strike Price is the price of an asset which was at the moment of entering the Binary Options market. In other words it is the current price that moves continually and once you buy Call or Put options, it becomes the reference that will determine your profit or loss. On the image above you will see that horizontal line representing the strike price.The Expiry Time is the period that defines when the option contract ends. In our case it is a 60 second trade, but you can set the Expiry Time to be an hour, a day, and get informed from larger timeframes, like M30, H1 or D1.As you can see from the image above, we entered the market and bought the Call option. You can see that the Expiry Time is 60 seconds (1), the invested amount is $10 (2) and the predetermined profit is 88% from investment (3). The vertical red line represents the end of the option and if at that point the price will stay above the Strike Price, then our trade was successful.Buying the Put option has the same principles, yet at this time the price should go down, which means below the strike price.Now, why you should not trade binary options?Most of the binary brokers out there are fraudulent and will exploit you until the balance reaches zero. You can read this material to understand that in many cases it is a scam: The wolves of Tel Aviv: Israel‚Äôs vast, amoral binary options scam exposedYou will see there how the brokers employ people who don‚Äôt have any idea about finance, how these employees become advisors and press clients around the world to make deposits, how the employees have fake names, biographies and stories, how the platforms use tricks to manipulate charts in their favors, how the brokers fraudulently assess their clients‚Äô wealth in order to know how much they can take from them, and many other such things.I hope this helps!Regards,Bob ParkerHolborn Assets About Us"

220,"Ah! If there ever were a question just for me, this one is is probably it.I‚Äôve been making a significant, mostly passive income from Quora for about a year now. Admittedly, I only stumbled into it.I had only discovered Quora just a few months prior. I was working a summer internship in a city separate from most of my friends, so I had a lot of spare time on my hands. Having always been a voracious reader, Quora kept me up a bit too late many or most work nights that summer.At some point, I began to feel a little guilty learning so many amazing things from other people and not giving back myself. So, I started writing answers to questions in the e-commerce and distribution space. I had been working independently in e-commerce for 8 years, and my internship was at a Fortune 200 distribution company.It‚Äôs worth noting that the thought of putting so much effort into writing these posts with the potential to reach tens, even hundreds of thousands of people made me super nervous at first. The first few times I hit submit, I immediately stood up and paced around a bit to shake it off.While most of my initial answers received very little attention, one blew up. The response (upvotes, comments) was tremendously positive. It was a great feeling.Around the same time, I was also reading quite a bit about affiliate marketing. I knew what it was all about from previous reading. After all, I had spent 8 years selling physical products online.For those of you not familiar, affiliate marketing allows you to make a commission selling other people and company‚Äôs products online, without actually fulfilling product orders or serving customers. You just have to make the introduction. You don‚Äôt have to be hired. You just post a link to the product or service that is unique to you, and software tracks any sales that result from your recommendation. The software knows that buyer purchased after clicking your link.Finally, I decided to give it a shot. There were services I was already mentioning and linking to in my answers that had affiliate programs themselves, so I swapped my links out for affiliate links.Within 30 minutes, I made one $30 commission.I immediately did the math to calculate how much more money I would make that day. $30 every 30 minutes‚Ä¶ 12 hours left in the day‚Ä¶ Holy #$%^!!!I didn‚Äôt make a penny more that day. But over the course of the next couple weeks, I did quite well.As it turns out, you can‚Äôt just drop affiliate links wherever you please and without disclosure. It violates Quora‚Äôs policy, and disclosure of affiliate links is required by the Federal Trade Commission.This goes for most 3rd party platforms like facebook, LinkedIn, Medium, and reddit as well‚Äî even though you create and contribute the content yourself.Now, if you still want to make money from affiliate marketing on these platforms, the key is to build blogs relevant to what you are writing about. That way, you own the platform and what kind of links you post are up to my discretion (so long as affiliate relationships are disclosed).Then you can post really informative, helpful content on 3rd party platforms like facebook groups, Quora, and reddit to cultivate an audience. From that content you can link to supplementary resources on your blog where you are free to use affiliate links and earn commissions. If that content is great as well, people will continue to read your content, use your links to support you financially, and share with friends.Let‚Äôs explore an example of how this works in practice:Did you know many credit card companies offer 0% interest as an introductory rate for the first X months of having their credit card? Did you know credit card companies also pay hefty affiliate commissions for successful referrals?During my senior year of college, I was a little strapped for cash. I had money, but most of it was tied up in my online businesses and/or stocks. However, I had a job lined up for after graduation, so I knew I would have cash coming in soon.All of my friends were taking senior vacations. I didn‚Äôt want to ask my parents for money‚Äî they had covered enough.So, I opened a few credit cards with 0% interest for 6‚Äì9 months. During the second semester of my senior year, I partied through an online marketing conference in Vegas, visited a friend in NYC, went skiing in Colorado, searched for housing in KC, and spent a weekend at the lake.I paid the cards off in the first couple months after graduation using my salary.Now, it‚Äôs not the smartest financial decision I‚Äôve ever made, but I‚Äôm not the only college student who would enjoy living it up a bit during senior year despite a lack of funds.How can I make money on that?Easy. Tell the story around Reddit, facebook groups, Quora, Medium‚Ä¶ Link from those posts to a blog post titled something like ‚ÄúTop 10 Credit Cards Offering 0% Interest.‚Äù That blog post would compare the pros and cons of each, and link to applications using, you guessed it, affiliate links. Links to credit cards paying me $50, $100, even $150+ for a signup.Again, it doesn‚Äôt stop there. Readers will enjoy the content. They will share with friends. They will come back for more helpful content again and again, assuming I keep it coming.Building the blogs themselves is a piece of cake these days. Here‚Äôs a 5-minute how-to. You don‚Äôt need to know how to code, you don‚Äôt need to be an expert designer‚Äî even the writing is made easier with tools like Hemmingway App.You can find affiliate products and services to promote with a simple google search. There are a lot of spammy products out there which are no good for your readers, nor your reputation.While many companies run their own affiliate programs independently, many utilize affiliate networks to manage the link tracking and connect with people who will promote their products. Affiliate networks are great places for you to find products and services you can promote.Here are just a few:Amazon: That‚Äôs right! Amazon has an affiliate program for nearly everything listed. Commissions vary. The interesting thing about Amazon is that you will not earn commissions solely on what you link a reader to, but everything they purchase in the next 24 hours!Share-a-Sale: Home to more than 3,900 affiliate programs‚Äî Share-a-Sale is sure to have something for your niche. Not only do their advertisers, pay for referred sales, many pay for clicks and ‚Äòleads‚Äô too. My personal favorite.Rakuten: One of the oldest networks around. Rakuten is known for its intuitive interface and over 1,000 advertisers, including many well-known brands.FlexOffers: Many well-known companies use this network, including Macy‚Äôs, HP, and Hallmark, along with a variety of lesser known companies.Commission Junction: Probably the #1 affiliate network overall, CJ is home to many of your household names. Credit cards, banks, insurance, security, real estate, fashion, you name it. Because there are so many big name advertisers here, competition can be stiff. You may actually have to apply for programs, and your site will be held to a higher standard.To sign up for a network or affiliate program, you will want to opt in as a ‚Äòpublisher‚Äô (‚Äòadvertisers‚Äô are who you promote for). Most will require that you provide a link to your blog. Again, you can set up a blog in very little time (video tutorial here). Hosting your blog will cost just less than $1/day, or 66 cents if you pay annually.If you provide good content for people, not only can you expect affiliate commissions, but generally people will reach out to you for consulting, coaching, friendship, business propositions, and more, depending on what you write about.Plus, anytime you have influence like that, there‚Äôs always the opportunity to sell your own info product, for which you can recruit other affiliates to sell for you.Best of luck!BONUS: I‚Äôm trying to get out of my comfort zone and do more public speaking of sorts. Recently, I did a podcast with Google Product Strategist, Sonali Mangal. As it turns out, getting a lot of exposure on Quora is a bit of a science. You can‚Äôt just write an answer and expect lots of views. Sonali and I discussed what works and what doesn‚Äôt on Quora. Listen here and enjoy!"

222,"I work in a Japanese IT company.Really, all it takes is language proficiency and a reasonable amount of skills in the given area (or not at all if you apply as a fresher).Actually it's not hard science: there is a shortage of qualified human resources in the Japanese IT world. I'd say it's the easiest field for a foreigner to be hired.Even if your Japanese isn‚Äôt that good, some company are still willing to hire you. However I wouldn‚Äôt recommend it: you risk yourself to be categorized as a ‚Äúcheap labor‚Äù which is highly unethical (but unfortunately common in some company). Needless to say your ‚Äúnegotiation power‚Äù will be near zero if you can‚Äôt speak the national language.In addition, being able to speak a fair amount of Japanese will definitively give more value to your candidature.Now about job itself.I believe it is a well known fact that Japanese salary-men work long hours. You should consider if you are willing to put the hard work and long hours. For instance, my typical work schedule start at 7:30 am until 8 or 9 pm. For the record I don‚Äôt think it is considered ‚Äúhard work‚Äù here. Just so you know.I already talk about black company and the 3K here. Let me copy and paste the interesting part for this answer:On Japanese mainstream media you often hear that there is a ""lack of IT technicians."" According to NHK morning program ohay≈ç Nippon, 87ÔºÖ of IT companies say they need more IT technicians. It is specially true in startups (ventures) because Japanese people still prefer to secure a job in a big Japanese company (social pressure and reputation is high when it comes to once company‚Äôs name).In addition, the Japanese IT world suffers of so called ""3K"" reputation. In Japanese, 3K stands for „Åç„Å§„ÅÑ„ÄÅÂ∏∞„Çå„Å™„ÅÑ„ÄÅÁµ¶Êñô„ÅåÂÆâ„ÅÑ (Kitsui, Kaerenai, Ky≈´ry≈ç ga yasui) or, in English, ""hard, unable to go back home, low salary"". There are unfortunately a lot of unscrupulous ""black"" corporation in the IT world.Therefore, there is a brain drain in the Japanese IT world. There is even a wikipedia page about it: ITÊ•≠ÁïåÈõ¢„Çå - WikipediaIs it really that bad?Yes and no.It will sound silly but it really depends on the company. If you look at companies such as DeNA, CyberAgent or Line, there is no chronic shortage of personnel there. On the contrary, despite being ventures (actually, mega-ventures) a lot of freshers apply there every year.During job hunting, I came across a lot of different company. Some where amazing, other where so black the guy in charge of the presentation almost burst into tears‚Ä¶How to tell apart black companies?Turnover in black businesses is abnormally high. If in the first three years, 30% of freshers leave the company, it is suspicious. The main reasons are:Overtimes are not paidTough working conditionsSalary is comparatively low (and doesn‚Äôt increase)Regarding salary, sometimes it is lower than expected but you should also check welfares. In my case, the salary is a little bit lower than average but I have apartment rental allowance, full subway allowance, self-investment allowance (they pay for diplomas and the books/courses I need to pass them), complete insurance and so forth.Fast employment process. Employment process for freshers is slow in Japan. There are several interviews and tests. If it seems abnormally short, that could be a red flag. However it is not necessarily the case. Some company, specially young one, doesn‚Äôt have time and resources to conduct eight interviews like in bigger companies.The interviewer's physical condition. Like I said, if the interviewer or employees seem really tired and/or sad, this doesn‚Äôt look good. It could be a bad cold or hay fever but generally you can tell apart. Use your guts.Office is dirty. During the company‚Äôs presentation or the interviews, look for signs of dirty office like dust. Ask to use the toilets. Toilets in Japan are almost always immaculate. If it smells bad, it doesn‚Äôt smell good for you either.Death from overwork and suicide. Big red flag. I know suicide rate is high in Japan (especially among men) and it could be not-work related but most case it is. Don‚Äôt waste your time and knowledge to help this kind of murderers.No follow-up after the job offer. I received a job offer by mail from a company that never ever contacted me afterward. I sent a hand-written refusal letter and still never heard a single word from them. It means you are just a number, they don‚Äôt care. In comparison, another company which gave me a job offer invited me and the other prospective employees for a official introduction and lunch with the employees. Even after I sent the refusal letter, they responded with a kind email and we are still on good terms as of today. My actual employee sent me a first email to avouch the job offer and a reminder email to know whether I made my decision to join in or not. You are a person, they do care about you and really want you to join in.Let‚Äôs talk more in details about how a typical Japanese IT company works.One common practice in IT world is to have Á§æÂÜÖ„É°„É≥„Éê„Éº (member inside the company) and ÂÆ¢ÂÖàÂ∏∏Èßê (people working onsite at the client office). I don‚Äôt know if it is a common practice in other country but I‚Äôd say almost every IT company in Japan does it. Basically, you are like a subcontracted human resource. So you may be working for company A but really you‚Äôre developing a project for company B which could itself be a subcontractor of company C or D‚Ä¶ Well you don‚Äôt really know for who you are developing.I think this practice is intensely frustrating. I personally like to know what my hours of sitting behind a desk will contribute to. I like to see results. But that is just my opinion.If that doesn‚Äôt bother you, you won‚Äôt have a problem to find a job in IT. Be prepared for a lot of stress though: generally, you will be sent to bigger companies than yours, with different rules and which can send a claim to your boss for whatever reason they feel is good enough (like yawning). Not that all company does that, but it happens.Another think I noticed is the overall lack of knowledge towards new technologies.I believe there are mainly two reasons for that:Lack of skills in English. Let‚Äôs be honest, new technologies information are mainly covered in English language. Which means if you don‚Äôt speak English you will never learn about it.Resistance to change. This one sounds like a stereotype towards Japanese people but it‚Äôs mostly true. The bigger the company, the stronger the resistance to change is. (If it works, why change?)Note: for the little stories, a lot of bank and investment systems in Japan are still running with cobol. Archaic version of IE are also very common here (and as a seasonal front-end dev that really piss me off!!!)However, those two points above could be your biggest weapons. For example, being able to speak English gives you access to ten times more first-hand information than Japanese. Need to solve a problem? No problem, surely someone somewhere in the world asked this in English. Being the web marketing guy, I‚Äôm on the edge for SEO tactics, which gives me an advantage over my company‚Äôs competitors.If you are a new technology maniac early-adopter kind of guy (or girl), you should aim small and fast developing startups. This is your best bet to find a ‚ÄúSilicon Valley‚Äù kind of environment.About the environment, you probably know Japan is quite homogeneous. Foreigners, except Chinese people, are still rare. Smaller companies are less strict on neckties and suits in general but a lot of big companies still ask every developer to wear one.Depending on your work and your responsibilities, you will be asked to know Japanese customs and strictly respects it. This point is actually common sense but I‚Äôve heard or read countless foreigners complaining about how they can‚Äôt raise in their company, without first checking up their attitude.I kept the most interesting for the end: salary.To say it frankly, if you want an IT job in Japan, it‚Äôs not for the salary. The salary here is way way behind what you could expect in other parts of the world. Plus if the salary system of your company is based on age, you are pretty much fucked for at least 10 years. Their are exceptions to this point; I‚Äôm speaking in general.When looking for a job, double check what are the welfare and double check the salary system (based of results/objectives or something else, presence or absence of bonus etc.)Rereading my answer, it sounds like I‚Äôm very critical towards IT companies. In fact, I want to be honest with you. Japan is an amazing country, amazing people but the work culture can disturb a lot of people. I don‚Äôt want you to be under any illusions that all that is easy.However, I, for one, love living here, I really like my job, my company and my colleagues. I wouldn‚Äôt change it and I wouldn‚Äôt go back to France and its 35h/week.Sure, some things do bother me sometimes but hey, I took the decision to live and work aboard, I accept responsibility for my selection. Furthermore it‚Äôs my duty to adapt to the local customs. And so is yours."
223,"While mesh networking is the ‚Äúnew-cool‚Äù ‚Äî it doesn‚Äôt really answer the question, and it isn‚Äôt really new. For the home, network extenders, have existed for years and cost much less than mesh components, and do as good a job. As mesh components become more common, their prices may drop, only time will tell.Any home networking setup is defined by numerous pieces - your ISP‚Äôs speeds - uplink and downlink aka ‚Äúthe pipe‚Äù; the speed of your modem; the speed of your router; the number of devices who are sharing that pipe.Beyond that, the difference between a mesh network and an extended network, except in certain buildings of heavy stone/brick/steel construction is negligible.The ISP incoming pipe controls the maximum speed you can possibly get on any connected device. WiFi devices, being Radio Frequency (RF) based are subect to all kinds of speed impacting issues. The throughput speeds of your modem and router will determine how much of the incoming ISP pipe is actually available to any connected device. The good news here is that the newest Routers, especially, have significantly enhanced throughput - especially for WiFi.Since all Wi-Fi systems are RF based, positioning of the devices and the antennas will determine your coverage. This doesn‚Äôt matter if it is a mesh or an extended network. My previous home was a 4-story brick Victorian Row home some 3500 square feet. I used an Apple Airport base station in the basement and an Airport extender on the second floor to provide solid signal coverage for most all of the house. I say most all, because the physical shape of the first floor with regards to the basement ment that the Kitchen required a separate extender. Today, I live in an apartment building with heavy stone walls and steel framework ‚Äî RF doesn‚Äôt penetrate the building for squat; no cellular coverage unless I‚Äôm standing in front of a glass window! So, naturally, Wi-Fi also does not penetrate from apartment to apartment. Yes, you could cover the area with a collection of extenders or mesh devices, but the same problems would exist with either solution.The final issue of speed is the most overlooked one ‚Äî Your ‚Äúbackhaul‚Äù pipe only has so much bandwidth. It doesn‚Äôt matter how fast your local network or device is, if you have multiple people sharing that pipe ‚Äî you have to divide the bandwith amongst them. If all you are doing is web-surfing or reading email, you won‚Äôt notice much ‚Äî until somebody starts streaming video. Web-surfing and email are basically asynchronous actions which do not require constant packe transfers (ignoring YouTube, etc.) But as sooon as you start streaming video, including YouTube, you are talking about the need for constant bandwidth ‚Äî usually quite high. So, depending upon how many streamers you have, your game playing WILL suffer significant degradation, as will the streams."
224,Impossible to tell. It depends how many weeks it is until there is a lottery winner. When there is no grand prize winner in a lottery the prize rolls over and dollars are added.That grand prize keeps growing. However for it to reach a billion it means the lottery needs to go may weeks sans winner.On the other hand it is surprising the interest in that big number. Research shows there are people that will no play at 90 million but will stand on line for hours at 100 million? Isnt 90 million enough for them?

229,"I started my day with the tastiest breakfast I've ever had.The secret was in the eggs. A friend took me to a woman who raises chickens in her backyard.But she doesn't just feed them and keep them safe: she sings to them, tells them stories at night to help them sleep, and keeps a close tab on the health and mood of each and every one of them.Something of that care and love is transmitted into the egg. The result is an explosion of flavor, a rich creaminess, a shiver of pleasure down the spine as soon as that fiery-orange yolk hits your palate.This woman is not working on a cure for cancer. Nor is she busy developing a hyperloop. In fact, only a handful of people know about her.But she does what she does‚Äîhowever humble her vocation may be‚Äîwith such love, devotion, and dedication, that she is making human lives more wonderful, one egg at a time.Now, here's what I believe.You don't have to be famous.

230,"I‚Äôm going to interpret this question as ‚Äúbest for climbing‚Äù, because the alternative is ‚Äúbest by design‚Äù, which would require me to write a book, possibly a trilogy. I can already envision it. ‚ÄúHarry Potter and the Mystery of Champion Design‚Äù, coming soon. But I digress.Best League Champions for ClimbingCorporate Mundo will remind you that climbing the ladder is just like running a business. Except that you won‚Äôt make any money. And that your only ‚Äúclients‚Äù are a bunch of toxic kids. But hey, you don‚Äôt get to toss cleavers at people in a business.Here‚Äôs something most coaches realize you should do, which most players don‚Äôt.Learn and master easy championsInstead of spending time perfecting your mechanics at a champion, and again when that champion shifts out of the meta, and again, and again‚Ä¶ Spare yourself the trouble. Pick the easiest champions. If you‚Äôre in the Elo range where Garen is still playable, play Garen. Dr. Mundo is another good example.Why easy champions?!Why would you do this? I didn‚Äôt know the reasoning for a long time, so as most people probably do when they hear this, I just ignored it. Then, I was reminded of it recently when I heard yet another strong player talk about this. It was the #1 Challenger in NA, Revenge, saying (verbatim): ‚ÄúPick a champion and master it. And I mean, like, really master it. Because then, you can actually start focusing on the little things, like when to ward, where to ward, positioning in team fights, teleport timings, and so on.‚ÄùThe philosophy behind this principle can thus be summed up in the following procedure:Learn champion ==> Master champion ==> Learn game ==> Master gameIf you‚Äôre learning your champion, you‚Äôre just learning your champion. Only when you‚Äôve mastered your champion, you can start learning the game. This is why you need to pick easy champions and stick with them. Even when you eventually get to high Elo, the only thing that changes is that ‚Äúeasy‚Äù is replaced with ‚Äúmeta‚Äù. This does inevitably mean you‚Äôll have to spend more time on the game just to keep up; that‚Äôs just how most games work.Simple =/= EasyAlso, I should clear up a common misconception. If you‚Äôre a Toplaner, I have news for you: Tryndamere is not an easy champion. His mechanics are simplistic, but not easy. They require a very precise timing that revolves around registering your opponent‚Äôs damage outputs accurately and predicting if you will survive their hard-CC during which you can‚Äôt activate your ultimate.Pay attention!Of course, this whole point about picking a champion, based on a combination of strong and easy depending on your Elo, relies on you paying attention during the game. You can just as well play Garen and not look at the mini-map, not think ‚Äúshould I pick this fight?‚Äù, not think ‚ÄúWill there be a team fight?‚Äù and ‚ÄúDo I want that team fight to actually take place?‚Äù. In order to profit off of your newfound champion pool building skills, you have to learn to identify key situations of the game and consciously remind yourself to pay attention to them, for example by asking these questions. Only then will any method of champion pool building actually have the intended benefits. In other words: pay attention.Hopefully this was a bit helpful to any of you. These are some of the coaching principles I‚Äôve picked up on from my very limited experiences with being a coach, and more so the playing principles I picked up from my experiences while playing."
231,"HieeStaying hydrated is critical to your running performance and, more importantly, for preventing heat-related illnesses. Dehydration in athletes may lead to fatigue,headaches, decreased coordination, and muscle cramping. Other heat-related illnesses, such as heat exhaustion and heatstroke, have even more serious consequences. Runners need to pay attention to what and how much they‚Äôre drinking before, during and after exercise.Pre-Run HydrationIf you're doing a long run or race (more than 8 to 10 miles), it's important to make sure you're well-hydrated during the few days leading up to your long run. You know you're well-hydrated if you void large volumes of pale urine at least six times a day. In the days leading up to your long run (or race), drink plenty of water and nonalcoholic fluids.An hour before you start your run, try to drink about 16 ounces of water or other non-caffeinated fluid.Drinking on the RunThe current advice about running and hydration is very simple -- try to drink to thirst. Scientific evidence says that drinking when you're thirsty can help prevent under hydrating (which can lead to dehydration) and over hydrating, which can lead to hyponatremia (low blood salt level due to abnormal fluid retention).If you're looking for a general rule of thumb for fluid consumption during your runs: You should take in 4 to 6 ounces of fluid every 20 minutes during your runs. Runners running faster than 8-minute miles should drink 6 to 8 ounces every 20 minutes.Determining Your Sweat RateThe above guidelines are the basic rules of thumb, but it's important to remember that everyone's fluid needs vary. Some people sweat more than others. To determine how much liquid to take during a run or race, you need to know your sweat rate, and that can vary between 1 to 4 quarts per hour. Weigh yourself nude before a timed training run, and then again after. One pound of weight loss equals 1 pint of water loss. Calculate your sweat rate and use this to determine your fluid needs during a run or race. For example, if you lose 2 pounds during an hour run, that's 2 pints or 32 ounces. Thus, you need 8 ounces of water or sports beverage every 15 minutes. Note the weather conditions on that day, and keep in mind that you may need to adjust your consumption if the conditions are different. You can do the sweat rate test on another day to see how different conditions affect your sweat rate.Post-Run HydrationDon't forget to rehydrate with water or a sports drink after your run. You should drink 20 to 24 fl oz. of water for every pound lost. If your urine is dark yellow after your run, you need to keep rehydrating. It should be a light lemonade colour.Thanks & Regards:Deepak Parul Sandhu"

234,"I never saw the Trump presidential campaign and its success as being predicated on any actual policy or any actual ability to govern. Trump never really told us how he‚Äôd do any of the things he said he‚Äôd do, and certainly has given nobody any reason to believe he‚Äôd be minimally competent to BE a decent President. If it truly were about governing, Trump‚Äôs feet would have been put to the fire until he actually TOLD us how he was going to do it. But his supporters didn‚Äôt ever ask that question, because they really didn‚Äôt care about that. They threw his support to him because he was talking just like their buddies at the bar do after a few rounds and they liked that talk.The only things we really know are the following:He‚Äôd build a wall on the US-Mexico border. (How?)He‚Äôd scrap the ACA. (he‚Äôs changing his mind about this one though).He‚Äôd deport undocumented immigrants. (How? Especially since police departments are now going on record as stating they will not help him do this)He‚Äôd bring back jobs to the Rust belt and coal country. (Umm..How? Especially since the Donald‚Äôs businesses are known for overseas manufacturing)He wouldn‚Äôt hesitate to bring back some of the worst Bush era ideas regarding fighting terrorism, even going as far as bombing innocent people who are unlucky enough to live in the same area as ISIS strongholds. (We‚Äôll see about this-but we do know this is possible since Bush and his crew did do a lot of this stuff).He will ban Muslims from entering the country (How?)Frankly, I don‚Äôt think Trump supporters care if he does these things or not. It was never about governing. It was about aggrieved working class and poor people, the vast majority of them being white and living in former factory/coal strongholds that have long withered away deciding that they‚Äôd had it with people who weren‚Äôt like them race wise, education wise, and life experience wise crapping all over them and what they believe in. Trump was a big middle finger to them.So, they don‚Äôt CARE what he does or doesn‚Äôt do. Trump is already backpedaling on a lot of what he said during the election, and people are still excusing him-just like they excused all of the hateful rhetoric, just like they excused the support from white nationalists and other racist groups, just like they excused all of the stumbling by Trump during the campaign, just like they excused all of the stuff involving Trump‚Äôs treatment of women, just like they excused Trump‚Äôs long list of business practices that actually PUT working people and small companies out of business and were outright fraudulent.They don‚Äôt care about whether or not he is fit to be President, or whether or not he appoints nutballs and slimebags to his administration, or whether or not he puts his kids in charge of national security, or whether or not his decisions that he will make as President will benefit him personally or not. None of that matters to this folk.What matters is that they were able to put a hurting on people they dislike, have no respect for, or outright hate. This didn‚Äôt start with Trump, the Tea Party was the earliest indication of this. They LOVE the fact that NOW, the news media is talking about THEM, and that the ‚Äúlibrul‚Äù media and that the elites (meaning anyone with a college degree who doesn‚Äôt live in the Rust Belt or the South) are flogging themselves for not listening to them all of these years. THEY are loving the attention and understanding/respect they are getting from the media and how in the future, respect will be paid. They also LOVE the fact that women, gay people, minorities and everyone else they have been saying have been given unjust breaks, respect, and attention at their expense are running scared and are distraught/angry. Just like a kid after throwing a tantrum, they got the attention they wanted-by putting in power a man who has absolutely nothing in his record to even give anyone any confidence about his ability or willingness to govern this country competently and to represent this country to the world.Unfortunately for them, this tantrum will get them nothing. The jobs aren‚Äôt coming back. The forces that put these people in the shape they are in will not be stopped by shipping a few Mexicans back to Mexico. Some of those forces are their responsibility, and some of these forces are not. And Trump will do nothing to end or stop those forces. He really can‚Äôt, even if he had half a clue how to do it. We don‚Äôt even know if he really WANTS to, seeing as he makes money off of shipping some of his business labor requirements to those same countries he‚Äôs now complaining about. Remember, this is the same guy that was happy about the 2008 recession-he boasted of making a ton of money off of the devastation that was the real estate market at the time.That‚Äôs what this was about. Don‚Äôt kid yourself. Trump in all likelihood will do none of the stuff he said he‚Äôd do (unless it benefits him personally), because he understands that his fans don‚Äôt expect him to (it might be the only thing he really understands about being a politician). He said as much when he said he could shoot someone in the middle of Fifth Avenue and his fans would still stand by him, and he wasn‚Äôt wrong-any one of the numerous things that he has said and is on record of having done, including all the lawsuits against him would have sunk any other candidate a long time ago."
235,"Dear friend,We give consideration to society(others) because whatever we are doing, is usually for the sake of society.Whatever you call as your ‚Äòpersonal‚Äô actions, the horrible fact is that even they are social actions. We may think that when we are alone in our house, let‚Äôs say in the kitchen or in the study room, then whatever we are doing over there, is a personal action. But it is not a personal action at all, because it is still being dictated by the society.There is a student who is in her study room preparing for an engineering entrance examination. But she is preparing just because of the social pressure. Now is this preparation, is the moment of preparation when she is alone in her study, is this a personal action or a social action?It is still a social action, even though the society does not appear to be present. The society is physically not present, but it is very much present. Where? In the mind. So even when we are doing something very personal, we are still guided by the society.Marriage, you would say is something totally personal. Marriage and love, are both called as ‚Äòpersonal‚Äô. But are we not guided by the society in all these matters? So, are our marriages personal? Is our love personal? No, it is totally social. Society, religion, class, all these things are guiding even our most private and intimate matters. And when our matters are all social, it is but obvious that we have to care for the society.You look at all these matrimonial portals. People who want to marry put their profile there. When you put your profile and fill the profile form, it has sections for your religion, for your caste, for your gotra. It asks, ‚ÄúHow much salary do you expect from your would-be spouse? What height, what kind of complexion? Whether he should be living in a joint family or a nuclear family?‚ÄùNow, are all these things not social? Did you decide your religion? Religion is a totally social thing which is handed over to you, and now you allow religion to come in the way of your love. Is love then social or personal?You are saying, ‚ÄúI will marry a boy of my gotra.‚Äù Now you didn‚Äôt decide your gotra. Did you? So, are you marrying the boy or the gotra marrying the boy? Obviously, one gotra is marrying the other gotra, where is any personal thing in this? It‚Äôs all social, you are not present in this. It‚Äôs a crowd. It‚Äôs all social, you are not present in this. It‚Äôs a crowd.Society has taught us what kind of features to look for in people to love. Now, because of years of colonization, in fact decades of colonization, in India you lay a great emphasis on fair skin. There are all these companies that sell fairness products in India. And believe me they cannot easily do that in any other country of the world. No country of the world is so mentally enslaved about complexion that you can sell a fairness cream, and people would also buy it.Elsewhere, people will say, ‚ÄúIt is fine that I am dark. Being dark is alright.‚Äù But you go on a date and you meet a boy who has very fair skin, you would choose him. But it is not you who has chosen him, it is the society that has chosen him for you. So, it‚Äôs not actually you who are dating him, the entire crowd is dating that boy. It may appear that two persons are meeting, but the two persons are not meeting, two crowds are meeting. Where are you in all this?What we call as ‚Äòourselves‚Äô is nothing but a crowd- mummy, papa, relatives and the entire world. Even when you say that I am doing something personal, the entire crowd is present. We are afraid of the society because we are not at all ourselves. We are just the society. What we need to ask is that is there anything that I am doing which is coming from my own free will? Is there anything that is arising out of understanding?Actions, thoughts, beliefs, that I consider as ‚Äònormal‚Äô, are they really normal or are they just conditioned? You general..."
236,"Well this is a simple process as long as you put in your time to chalk out a routine that matches your pup‚Äôs daily routine. Having a pup at home is like having a baby in the house except that they grow up quickly :PGenerally these young naughty creatures have a very simple routine ‚Äì Eat, Sleep and Play. And this cycle goes in loop throughout their life. The only changes that come in this cycle are the intervals between these three main activities increases and their duration decreases with their growing age. This was in short the entire life of dogs.Now a little homework you need to do before you start the training :-1.¬†¬†¬† Understand your pups entire routine. This will include all his day along activities along with time like when does he eat, when does he sleep, when does he go for a walk, how often does he eat and how much.2.¬†¬†¬† You need to understand when can you take him out and at what times and how far would be the places you can take him to pass off.3.¬†¬†¬† The words that you would use to prompt him to go out. These are very important as they are a lifelong learning for the pup and that‚Äôs how he can signal you that he wants to go out.That‚Äôs it. Just a little work. Pups generally want to pass after:-1.¬†¬†¬† Waking up in the morning(especially)2.¬†¬†¬† Sometime after having meals3.¬†¬†¬† Playing or rigorous activityThey don‚Äôt have much control over themselves so a good thing would be to take time out at least every hour or two. This absolutely does not mean that you wake him up from the sleep and take him out just because I said so. I am saying this because if your pup is very playful then it will need to pass after every hour or so. Morning schedule has to be followed strictly and not missed out at any cost else you‚Äôll see wet patches on your favourite carpet. Eating meals stimulates their digestive system which is why when they are done, after 15-20mins take them out for a small walk. This will help them digest the food well as well as pass off. ¬†You need to decide a place where you take him. In case you have a garden and want a specific spot to be introduced to him as his area to pass then take him there. This introduction has to be done in early years. Also always accompany him. Reasons ‚Äì they feel secured and the bond between you and him enhances, to protect him from any unforeseen situation, to keep a check that it does not eat something outside(as this is the time when they are very exploring and when I say ‚ÄúEXPLORING‚Äù I mean every alphabet of it.), to keep him from scaring an older dog( which they love doing) and to watch his health as well. Initially, pat him whenever he understands your ‚Äúsecret‚Äù word and goes out to pass. You can also treat him for this. You can decide the time to take him out according to how far is the place from your house and fix the timings to take him out matching your and his schedule. As far as the words are concerned decide them carefully. Don‚Äôt mix them with any other command words.¬†Some things to avoid disturbances in this routine: - 1. Don‚Äôt overfeed or frequently change their diet or the type of foods they generally have.2. Feeding at wrong times or not on fixed timings3. Excess of salt and spices(this makes them drink more water)4. Leaving the door open for the pup to come and go as it wants5. Restrict their access to carpets and rugs( just in case you want as they feel like grass).6. Don‚Äôt expect him to spend the entire night without going out especially when it‚Äôs so young.7. Punishing, scolding and shouting on him for any indoor accidents(this will make him scared of you and he might not pass in front of you)8. Leaving the pup alone for long hours. This will make him such an indoor person that it will not go out for long and will rush indoors quickly.Don‚Äôt be lazy. Laziness on your part would disrupt the habits of your pup.¬†Some common problems faced by owners: --> Excited urination on greeting people or overdose of happiness ‚Äì Sometimes pups get over excited when they greet people or get their favourite treat. To avoid this take him outside before anybody arrives at your house or before you are planning to give him his favourite treat.->Does not pass off when outside ‚Äì Pups don‚Äôt relieve when out for¬† long walks and pass immediately getting indoors. You need to break this habit take him for a long walk so he is forced to go outside.¬†Many a times things won‚Äôt go as planned. It‚Äôs okay. Understand you both are learning. He is learning something he doesn‚Äôt know and he can‚Äôt tell you what he feels. You need to give him time. And you are learning what he loves doing, eating and how much he loves you.Above all love him as much as you can. That‚Äôs the only emotion they have in abundance and they do it selflessly. Enjoy !! :D"

240,"I‚Äôve looked up some common opinions from Corgi Husky mix owners.Here is what they have to say about this adorable mixed breed:‚ÄúThis little guy melts my heart every time I look at him. Not only is he adorable, but he‚Äôs very energetic and a trainable dog.‚Äù‚ÄúYou can think of the horgi a bit like a compact husky. They‚Äôre a bit devious, but they love to do tricks and learn new things. Very fun to have around at home. I would definitely recommend them!‚Äù‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs not to love about this ball of energy? You have to exercise them, or they‚Äôll make a mess at home. Keep that in mind.‚ÄùSome people have nicknamed this breed to be called the Horgi or the Siborgi! You can see both of these words commonly used to refer to the Corgi Husky mix.SizeGenerally speaking, the Corgi Husky mix is a small to medium sized dog that has a tendency to sit low to the ground more like the Corgi than like a Husky. While the dog did take some physical characteristics of the Husky, they largely remained the size of a Corgi.Most Horgis weigh between 20 and 50 pounds and stand about 13 to 15 inches off the ground.The Horgi is a small to medium sized dog and is low set to the ground like the Corgi. It is thought the idea of this breeding might have been to get the Husky look but with the Corgis smaller and lower set stature. He weighs between 20 to 50 pounds and stands around 13 to 15 inches tall. This means he is quite a sturdy looking dog but with short legs. He head is rounded, and he has eyes that are almost almond shaped and ears that can be erect.AppearanceThe Horgi looks like a Husky with a smaller, shorter stature like the Corgi. They look very sturdy, but have very short little legs that are usually associated with Corgis.Colorwise, the coat of the Corgi Husky mix can look like the Corgi or the Husky.

244,"The popular hypothesis on the expanding universe is partially summed up by the Big Rip (Big Rip) conjecture.We know that the universe is expanding. What is new is that there seems to be an acceleration to this expansion. If so, it will lead to some astounding dynamic events in the universe. As described in the Wiki article and in many other sites on the internet, at some point in the far future the expansion rate will become greater than the gravitational attraction of the galaxies, which will begin to move away from each other. Then galaxies themselves will diffuse and spread apart, then solar systems (which will be long dead by then), followed by stellar remnant disintegration, planetary disintegration, molecular disintegration.What happens next is still open to conjecture, but we can do a thought experiment and come up with a pretty good answer.The accelerating expansion will then pull electrons from nuclei and pull protons and neutrons from the nucleus.Now things become interesting. All the neutrons will decay to protons, electrons, and anti-neutrino within a brief time, leaving protons as the next target.But what happens when the expansion rate becomes greater than the strong nuclear force? Well, we know that the proton is made up of three quarks (two up and one down). We also know that quarks cannot exist in isolation. So what happens? The increasing expansion of the universe becomes greater than the strong nuclear force and pulls the quarks apart. This takes a great deal of energy. Where does this energy come from?As the quarks are pulled apart, they combine with virtual quark particles from the vacuum energy and form mesons; quark and anti-quark pairs. Normally, the mesons would decay very quickly (10‚àí8ùë°ùëú10‚àí1610‚àí8to10‚àí1610^{-8}to 10^{-16}) seconds, but the rate of expansion pulls the quark anti-quark pair of the meson apart before it can decay. This produces two more mesons, which produce four mesons, which produce eight, and we have an exponentially increasing creation of matter.Where does the energy come from to create all this matter? One proposed form of dark energy is that it is equivalent to the vacuum energy of space, that is, virtual particles. And dark energy is proposed as the energy of acceleration.So now we see that dark energy is being converted to matter in the form of quark anti-quark mesons and thus the amount of dark energy is reduced. If dark energy is reduced, so then is the acceleration of the universe. Eventually, we have complete conversion of dark energy to meson matter. But the expansion continues and meson matter continues to form.We can think of the initial expansion rate of the universe as inertia. The continued formation of meson matter then begins to slow down the expansion rate. But since we have an exponential growth of meson matter, the expansion rate will slow down rapidly.When the expansion rate slows enough, the mesons will then have time to decay into photons (gamma), electrons, positrons, neutrinos, and anti-neutrinos. The electrons and positrons will combine and decay into two gamma photons. So the resulting universe will consist of photons, neutrinos, and anti-neutrinos.What happens next is completely unknown and would require some clever and difficult calculations to arrive at an answer. Will the resulting expansion rate become negative? Will the significantly increased mass-energy of the universe contribute to a negative expansion (shrinking)?Lots of good things to think about here.Cheers!"

246,"Intrinio, where I am a writer, is working on this by building a financial data marketplace that addresses many of Bloomberg‚Äôs weaknesses.Bloomberg charges massive fees ($2,000 per person per month) for a terminal that includes just about everything any investor would want. This is great if you have $2,000/mo for each of your employees and need many types of data. Intrinio takes a different approach, allowing users to sign up for just the data feeds the need. This means that if you only need 1 or 2 feeds, your costs might be $40 or $140 per month, or even be free.Another problem with Bloomberg is that they restrict access to their data. This is changing somewhat, with online portals, but most Bloomberg users have to access the data they need through a specific ‚Äúterminal.‚Äù Intrinio thinks this is ridiculous and so allows any number of users to access a single paid account via Excel, Google Sheets, or even API.This last access method, API, is probably the key difference. Fintech developers typically can‚Äôt build financial applications because company‚Äôs like Bloomberg have a monopoly on the data and charge outrageous prices if you want to redistribute their data via an app. Intrinio makes its data easy to access for developers and even has a program to give data away for free to startups.This article gives a good overview of Intrinio‚Äôs API.If you want to know who will disrupt Bloomberg, check out Intrinio.

249,"The primary impacts will be in the form of:More employment[1]Better government services[2]Lower corruptionThis is why it attracts so much excitement. There are some side effects of lower prices over the long term, but compared to the benefits above, it is a relatively minor effect.The primary way to get India out of poverty is to have a manufacturing revolution. However, most entrepreneurs don‚Äôt want to setup factories in India. Part of the reason is due to extreme complexity in taxation. Clothing manufacturers would rather setup their factories in places like Bangladesh [already has GST and other reforms] rather than the traditional textile power of India.What the GST seeks to do is to remove one of the primary hurdles in setting up business in India. When factories can move things efficiently and effectively comply with laws, more factories will be created. When more factories are created, there will be more jobs, lower prices [more competition] and more tax collection for the government.The GST is expected to bring government more revenues and this has been the case in many other countries that have implemented: Goods and services tax (Australia).When governments make more money through GST either they can reduce other taxes or increase services. Either of these will be benefit for the common man.Finally, the GST will enable much more transparency and lower corruption as there is a single window of tax collection than an opaque system with babus inserting hands in every window.Biggest concerns:The tax rate is very high[3]especially for services. Even at the proposed 18% it is higher than most of Indian competitors such as Thailand, Malaysia, Singapore, China etc. The government doesn‚Äôt want to cap even this.There is no clarity on how the city municipalities will get their share as they are no longer allowed to tax octroi and other taxes.Hoping that these kinks are rolled out. Ultimately it is the big picture that excites.Almost every country in the world have moved to GST in the past 25 years[4] and the experience has been mostly positive. Hardly 20 countries are holding out, India one among them.Footnotes[1] India's reverse Brexit: GST will create million of formal jobs - The Economic Times[2] Here's Why the Landmark GST Bill has the Potential to be a Gamechanger for India[3] Worldwide VAT, GST and Sales Tax Guide - Rates[4] Countries Implementing GST or VAT"
250,"How do I reset my Gmail password when I don't remember my recovery information?Sad fact: You CAN‚ÄôT.Unsurprisingly, Google has very solid account security. Among the finest in the world, in fact. If you have lost or forgotten your Google/Gmail password, or if your account was hacked, you have exactly one way to get back into that account. The automated process that starts here:https://accounts.google.com/sign...That‚Äôs IT.Really!I‚Äôve answered variations on this other times and places, and added a lot of other detail. But it all adds up to the same thing.If you have a G Suite account thru a business or school, you can call your Administrator. If you own a G Suite hosted domain (cheaper and easier than you think, and worth doing) or if you are an Admin on a domain, then you can call tech support at Google, directly. They‚Äôre available 24/7, and trust me, they are good.But with a free Gmail account, if you get locked out, you absolutely cannot contact a human being at Google about it. You can‚Äôt call, text, email, snail mail, carrier pigeon or pony express them.Sorry. No.UPDATE, 10/17/2018. There is a new product, Google One. It offers additional account storage - and tech support, for gmail addresses, including live phone support. Which of course made me VERY curious if this could be used to unlock accounts. So being as I already pay for additional storage and was therefore automatically enrolled in Google One, I filled in the little form, and had them call me.And the answer is‚Ä¶ NO. The tech support folks you can reach with the Google One service do indeed work for Google. But they do not (and cannot!) offer any assistance for locked out accounts, other than to walk you thru the automated process. If that process fails to get you in - you lost the account.Side issue: The reason there are so many collapsed answers here is because there are a ton of scammers out there who want you to call them, and they work hard to get their links into Quora answers. They will also use every trick there is to convince you they are somehow affiliated with or sanctioned by Google. They aren‚Äôt. They can only use the same automated process I linked above - and charge you good money for doing something you can do yourself.Again, there is only one way to recover a free Gmail/Google account.https://accounts.google.com/sign...If you can‚Äôt get in using that process, you lost the account. Forever.So the best advice I can give you is to carefully go thru the Security Checkup process on your Google Account page, here: https://myaccount.google.comYou can set up a recovery phone number and email address. I STRONGLY suggest you use both, and make the recovery email address one that belongs to a close family member or trustworthy friend. NOT one of your own, that you may forget or lose!Also set up 2-Step Verification, using every possible safety option, including printing your recovery codes and stashing them in several places. Used properly, 2 Step can and will prevent your account getting hacked."
251,"Contrary to popular belief in this thread, it is entirely possible to accurately self-diagnose a ‚Äúmental illness‚Äù. The fact that it is risky, potentially unnecessary, and professionally unverified is where the ethical conundrum comes in. It may not be in your best interest, and you may not have the information that would lead you to a proper understanding of whether it is in your best interest.Secondly, it is also possible to figure out an appropriate medication regimen on your own, in the rarer cases that a medication regimen is the most useful strategy. But, once again, that is highly risky, potentially unnecessary, and lacking the professional oversight and resources that are ideal towards keeping drugging more productive and less dangerous.The first is not the worst idea, if it is a constructive step for you and you do not rely on that diagnosis to determine your life path or risk-taking therapeutic goals. The second is not a good idea at all. Even if you are one of the minority that could benefit significantly from drugging, the trickiness and substantial risks involved with psychiatric psychotropics means one could not conscionably suggest that you would be better off taking that sort of risk as compounded by a lack of professional input and oversight.Ultimately, the DSM and prescribing information packets are not the governing forces behind psychiatric decisions. They are guidelines and fuzzy boundaries and they neither guarantee accurate and helpful outcomes nor safety and appropriateness. The level of additional understanding and experience-driven expertise involved in tactical and risk-reducing prescribing of psychotropic drugs in the mental health setting is not reducible to a few chapters of a book, though handling the needs of a single patient is at least less of a potential shitfest than fancying yourself a doctor and taking on clients.Basically, can this turn out well? Sure. That does not mean it is more likely to, and it has not even been established on authority that medication is a good idea in the first place.Do understand that ‚Äòfinding the right dose‚Äô is not the most difficult part of prescribing psychiatric drugs. Finding the drugs that cause the least amount of trouble for someone while still being meaningfully useful, and dealing with emergent side effects (which can be life-threatening, long term, or disabling)‚Äîincluding withdrawal syndromes‚Äîis a more pressing matter. So, it is not just about ‚Äúright drug, right dose‚Äù, but how to taper up and down, what drug combinations to avoid, how to notice negative side effects and what aspects of the drugging to ascribe them to, etc.A professional will not necessarily do a great job at all, and thousands upon thousands of patients experience preventable harms and death because of how the mental healthcare system is run at the moment. However, this is not something you want to do without professional consultation‚Äîespecially good professional consultation. If you are desperate and determine to do something about your experiences, focusing on the non-pharmaceutical methods until you can access a psychiatrist or other kind of competently prescribing doctor is probably the best idea.Some psychiatrists, to note, are available by telephone or videoconference. It is not the most reliable or responsible way to evaluate patients or prescribe drugs, but even that would be better than ‚Äòflying blind‚Äô in the professional sense. There are also free, low-cost, or sliding-scale psychiatric practices in many areas, though this may not be an option for you still.And, to be clear, I am not a healthcare professional, either. This is just lay commentary from someone who has dealt with many providers, facilities, conditions, drugs, and patients."
252,"Hmm. Okay, so everyone here has given the scary answers, there are other possibilities, mainly, the reason it occasionally happens to me: AllergiesI have pretty strong environmental allergies, and because of that, I have post nasal drip. Mmmm, it‚Äôs when the mucous from your nasal passages drip onto the back of your throat. This can make your throat feel scratchy, phlegmy, and just gross. It makes me want to do that disgusting phlegm-sucking noise and spit.If your nasal passage is really irritated, it might be bleeding slightly, and that‚Äôs what you‚Äôre seeing. If your throat/back of your mouth is very irritated from the constant dripping, it could be mildly bleeding.Post-nasal drip happens mostly at night because of the reclining position, and it isn‚Äôt always allergy related (though it‚Äôs almost never anything serious).Whatever the cause might be, go get checked out, I just wanted to throw a more normal, less scary option out there."
253,"I‚Äôve met many leaders in my life, and they all share similar traits. Sure, we do things a bit differently here and there, but for the most part, we‚Äôre alike. Are leaders born with these traits? I think partly, yes. I have known many young men who grew up similarly to me ‚Äî the same backgrounds, the same country ‚Äî who weren‚Äôt able to translate what they wanted into what they became.Perhaps half nature and half sheer force of will make leaders a bit different than those who just follow. Regardless, all of them I have met possess at least 9 traits.1. Optimism ‚ÄîAll it takes is one negative person to infiltrate ten positive people. Sometimes positivity is harder to spread than negativity. Instead of getting bogged down by what isn‚Äôt working, leaders rise up to the occasion and inspire positivity. When it‚Äôs hard to know what is coming, it‚Äôs easy to want to give up. Those who lead persevere, partially because they don‚Äôt know how not to. It‚Äôs not their natural response.Not only does positivity lead people, it motivates them to mirror who is leading.2. Intuition ‚ÄîWhen an employee or a project is leading towards a lost cause, I know it before it happens. But I‚Äôm not psychic; I‚Äôm intuitive, and there is a difference. How I have become intuitive is something that I learned from an early age‚Äìto always prepare for what‚Äôs to come. In business, I keep my hands and eyes on everything that happens in my company. Since ARETI is a large company and I cannot be everywhere at once, I make sure to hire people I can trust to report back to me.3. Generosity ‚ÄîAs a businessman and leader, I try to be generous with people and my community, which is why I push my employees to give to charity and take part in philanthropic initiatives. By being philanthropic, I think I make my employees want to be as well. Research shows that a socially conscientious employer makes for happier employees overall.Aside from fostering a sense of generosity from my company and those around me, leaders can be generous by listening those who have great ideas or present solutions when others are presenting problems. Having an open-door policy at work is a great way to let people know that you are listening and present day-to-day.4. Decisiveness ‚ÄîAn indecisive person will fail as a leader. It‚Äôs as simple as that. They may move up the ranks in their company because they are competent but they will not have the ability to lead anyone anywhere. Everyone needs to know that the final decision comes from the top (meaning you), or someone else will take the helm. Or worse, the venture, project, or company will fail from being in constant flux. A leader in constant conversation with his or herself is set to be stuck in a back and forth where it is impossible to lead anything anywhere positive.5. Charisma ‚ÄîAn important thing that thought leaders have is being able to speak in public. Many cite public speaking as their number one worst fear ‚Äî about 40% of them. But if that 40% want to become leaders, they‚Äôll have to overcome that. When I think about those who have been the most memorable leaders, I recall the likes of Elon Musk, Steve Jobs, and Winston Churchill. What makes them powerful public speakers (and leaders) is their ability to evoke passions from those they are speaking to, and they do it with charisma. Some people are born with it, but like public speaking, even charisma can be learned. I suggest you do so.If you want to be persuasive ‚Äî something I‚Äôve often had to be with investors, business partners, and employees ‚Äî remember that charisma is #1.6. Restlessness ‚ÄîThe feeling of restlessness causes a leader to become kinetic, which is a time of great possibilities. When leaders feel restless, it is a time when they aim to do more and become more innovative. Instead of complacency, they are always on the precipice of something better than what‚Äôs come before. Leaders never stop thinking or doing.Though a previously mentioned leader like Apple‚Äôs Steve Jobs was known to be unrelenting to his staff, he was always striving, always learning, and extracted excellence from both his staff and his products. With his constant frenetic, restless mind, he created not just a business, but also an iconic empire.7. Integrity ‚ÄîPeople mimic the leaders, so it‚Äôs vital that you display honesty. As much as possible, leaders use transparency to garner trust. Without trust, it‚Äôs nearly impossible to lead a company towards a successful venture. Those who trust their bosses tend to be more productive, making them better, more dependable employees. Honest leaders create a solutions-oriented staff and company.8. Emotional Stability ‚ÄîWhen you‚Äôre starting or managing a business, unexpected things will happen, but it is how you react to challenges that make you either a leader, or an emotionally immature dreamer. All the traits of a leader I‚Äôve mentioned so far are ones of action, but there is also the strength that comes from inaction. If a leader reacts to every crisis that arises, the company is consistently in chaos.In fact, according to a survey conducted by the Journal of Applied Psychology, ‚Äú[‚Ä¶] out of the Big Five personality traits, only emotional stability and extraversion significantly predicted people‚Äôs ability to cope with change.‚ÄùBy not acting and not reacting immediately upon every dissatisfying situation, he or she conveys a sense of inner wisdom ‚Äî something many employees I eventually let go didn‚Äôt have.9. Daring ‚ÄîBreaking the rules and setting new trends is something I and so many people in my position exhibit. From Richard Branson to the first-time startup founder pitching to Silicon Valley VC firms, fearlessness is essential if not the most important thing a leader must possess. Without risk, there is complacency, and with complacency comes decline. Great leaders are always moving which is what creates the distance from them to the rest of the pack.Final Thoughts:I believe great leaders are often born with these 9 leadership traits, but with hard work, these traits can be learned if applied and practiced in your everyday life. Once this practice becomes a regular habit, you‚Äôre well on your way to leading instead of falling behind.Read more on my blog: 9 Traits of a Good Leader."
254,"In geographical terms both bay and sea are marginal water bodies, surrounded by land but not completely land locked (otherwise it will become lake).Now coming to question, there is no difference in both, both are used interchangeably.One may argue that Bay are smaller than sea, but Bay of Bengal is much bigger than dead sea. If someone argues that Bay is bigger than sea than Arabian sea is bigger than Bay of Fundy. If Bay has to be landlocked specifically from 3 sides than Red sea should be termed as Bay which is not the case. I hope this clears your doubt.Moreover, sea is sometimes misnomer as Caspian sea, dead sea etc despite of being landlocked are designated as sea, which is wrong geographically. As in the earlier ages, they were named as sea, therefore they are continued to be called as sea (going with same logic, Lake Baikal is bigger than dead sea and it is landlocked same as the former but still designated as lake)."

He was the first Indian to reach 10,000 and 100,000 followers on the medium, and currently has 4.2 million followers.Dr. Tharoor is also a recognised authority on India, especially regarding its recent economic transformation and future prospects, globalisation, freedom of the press, human rights, literacy, culture, foreign affairs, cricket and more, and is a compelling and effective speaker, fluent in English, French as well as in Malayalam and Hindi.Source: Dr. Shashi Tharoor's official websiteDr. Tharoor is especially notable for his extraordinary eloquence while speaking, as demonstrated by the immense popularity of his speeches on online platforms such as YouTube. For instance, his speech decrying British Colonialism, delivered at the Oxford Union in 2015 has amassed over 3.9 million views on one site alone, while simultaneously being praised as ground-breaking in various educational institutions in India. Further speeches such as those explaining the importance of ""soft power"" and analyzing the impacts of education in India have garnered over 1,000,000 and two million views respectively.Dr. Tharoor is known for his views on a number of topics including economics, history, governance, and geopolitics due to both his well-regarded educational attainment and his broad experience while at the United Nations. Many note that it is his combination of wit, charm, wry humor, and intelligence that make him accessible and held in high esteem, both in India and abroad.‚ÄùHonours, awards and international recognition[edit]1976 ‚Äì Rajika Kripalani Young Journalist Award for the Best Indian Journalist under 30.[74]1990 ‚Äì Federation of Indian Publishers' Hindustan Times Literary Award for the Best Book of the Year for The Great Indian Novel.[citation needed]1991 ‚Äì Commonwealth Writers' Prize for the Best Book of the Year in the Eurasian Region, for The Great Indian Novel[74]1998 ‚Äì Excelsior Award for excellence in literature, Association of Indians in America (AIA) and the Network of Indian Professionals (NetIP).2000 ‚Äì Doctor of Letters in International Affairs by the University of Puget Sound1998 ‚Äì Global Leader of Tomorrow, World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland[citation needed]2004 ‚Äì Pravasi Bharatiya Samman, India's highest honour for non-resident Indians (accepted 20072008 ‚Äì Doctorate Honoris Causa, University of Bucharest, Romania.2009 ‚Äì Zakir Hussain Memorial ""Pride of India"" Award.2009 ‚Äì Inspiration of the Year Award at GQ's Man of the Year Awards.2009 ‚Äì Hakim Khan Sur Award for National Integration, Maharana of Udaipur.2010 ‚Äì Sarva Deshiya Prathibha Award, Pazhassiraja Charitable Trust.March 2010 ‚Äì ""New Age Politician of the Year"" Award, at NDTV's Indian of the Year awards.2010 ‚Äì Fifth IILM Distinguished Global Thinker Award, New Delhi.2010 ‚Äì Digital person of the year, Indian Digital Media Awards (IDMA), for popularising the digital medium in India.[78]2013 ‚Äì First Sree Narayan Guru Global Secular and Peace Award at Thiruvananthapuram.2013 ‚Äì PETA's ""Person of the YearSource: Shashi Tharoor - WikipediaThe only deserving Prime Minister of India in 2019 is Dr. Shashi Tharoor and no one else."

258,"Because of personal interpretations of the religion. Many Hindus are vegetarian, not because of some humanitarian ideal but because of certain requirements of some religious practices and rituals. I know this statement is controversial but let me explain.Hinduism by itself does not promote or prohibit any particular type of food types. Any compulsion is primarily driven by the religious practices of the individual involved. In serious religious practice, there is a concept of ‚ÄúAhimsa‚Äù. This not only means following vegetarian food but also non-violent thoughts.Why vegetarianism is preferred? Humans have a lot of hormones common with other animals but don't have many commons with the plants. When we consume meat, we will be exposed to many hormones like adrenaline, testosterone, progesterone and others depending on the animal that we eat. Now, if you look at the physical and emotional effects of these hormones on human body you will understand that eating meat will cause these effects to be artificially induced in the body. Also the amount of these hormones produced in the human body is different from the ones produced in different animals. Larger animals tend to produce larger quantities of these hormones. To this effect, even some plants are prohibited like garlic, onions, etc. There tend to have elements that negatively impact the emotional health of a human.Now, in Hinduism, we have traditions which require years of strict meditation practices with unwavering mental balance and discipline. Imagine how difficult or impossible would it be to meditate if the practitioner has eaten an animal with some quantity of adrenaline. This would be absorbed by the human body and depending on the quantity will cause emotional turmoil in the body and mind. How successful will that person in the meditation? As plants do not have many hormones matching with the humans, what would happen if the person is eating plants instead of animals during this religious practice. Just by the logic, you should improve the success rate drastically by following a vegetarian diet.Humans are also social animals. They will tend to get influenced by their peers or surrounding, sometime called ‚Äúsocial engineering‚Äù. Due to the interaction with other humans there is possibility of aggressive thoughts like anger, lust, jealousy, etc. This prevents people from developing revolutionary ideas and thinking out of the box solutions. To this end, some serious practitioners are even know to isolate themselves from normal public life (ascetics) and move to forests. Once their research is done, they come to public life and share the goodies of their knowledge with commoners. These ascetics are called Rishis.Now, when commoners come in contact with the Rishis and their advanced knowledge, they tend to misunderstand their food preferences to be the reason for the advancement. Common people try to imitate these great people based on their food habits as it is the most evident factor. Now a days, these imitation has risen to fanatic levels and they are even ready to hurt others who do not comply with their norm. In doing that they follow a strict vegetarian diet but a violent thought, which fails the primary tenant of Ahimsa.Vegetarianism was not compulsory for commoners, it is only advised for Rishis as it makes their path easier to achieve. Just like every tradition if followed without understanding the underlying reason becomes superstition, the vegetarianism has also become superstitious.If you are a Hindu, you only need to be a vegetarian if it is necessary for your occupation or purpose of your life. Otherwise, you can follow your taste."
259,"yes obviously you canTatkal ticket Cancellation RulesIf you get confirmed Tatkal ticket for all reserved class (sleeper/1AC/2AC/3AC) no money will be refunded for cancellation of ticket and this is valid for both window ticket as well as online site booked ticket and obviously you get refund of money for cancellation of waiting tatkal ticket.If you get tatkal waiting list ticket online:1) You can generate cancellation request through irctc online.2) Or also if it not get confirmed and chart prepared it will be automatically get cancelIn both of the above cases the money will be refunded to the account by which you make payment for the tickets within a week. One notable thing that you will lose same IRCTC service charges (sleeper/2S -‚Çπ20 and for AC-‚Çπ40) in both the cases.But when ticket automatically get cancelled after chart preparation you will also get refund of your flat cancellation charges (1AC-‚Çπ120, 2AC-‚Çπ100, 3AC-‚Çπ90, Sleeper-‚Çπ60, 2S-‚Çπ30).If you get tatkal waiting list ticket from window:You can ask TT for a seat, you can enjoy your whole journey standing in train or if you have your other friends with confirmed ticket you can enjoy with them too and it is officially allowed. Simply your ticket will not get automatically cancelled if you want to cancel it you have to reach nearby railway station (preferred from you taken that ticket) generate a cancellation there on a provided cancellation form. You may be given refunded money hand to hand or maybe they tell you the place, date and time for collecting your refunded money.Note : Answer may be now outdated with change in price and other rules."
260,"Good question, because people are often confused by this.Properly speaking, the CCS are a set of specific guidelines about what students should know at each grade level in Math and English Language Arts/Literacy. You can find the complete list of Standards at Common Core State Standards Initiative. You can read how these Standards were developed at About the Standards.It is important to note that these Standards were developed by a consortium of state and private-sector interests. The federal government was not involved in the development process, but strongly endorsed them after publication.The most common sources of confusion about the CCS is what they are not.They are not a set of classroom practices, teaching methods, or curricula. There are no official CCS curricula. Various publishers claim that their products are ""CCS-aligned"", but it is difficult to evaluate these claims independently. Likewise, you might see rants about ""crazy Common-Core questions"" (especially math problems), but such claims are nonsense--again, CCS is not a list of problems, it is a set of outcomes that you can read as linked above.They are not a standardized testing regime. There are actually two major standardized tests supposedly based on CCS (SBAC and PARCC), and numerous smaller ones (especially state-level tests). Again, these are neither a part of CCS nor necessarily endorsed by them.Bottom line: As both a parent and as a mathematics educator, I think that CCS represent a good, if incremental, improvement over earlier (NCTM) Standards, and have been much more effective at generating visibility (though sometimes more negative than positive, unfortunately). I am not sure that we are anywhere near ready for standardized testing based on CCS, since implementation is new and inconsistently supported. Professional development for teachers lags significantly, as it usually does. It would probably take a full generation of students passing through CCS--i.e, a K-12 experience--before it is fair to begin assessment of implementation. Unfortunately, I doubt that we have the patience for that."
261,"How do you go from nothing to a published research paper? The first and most important step is the least glamorous: Read, Read, and Read. You cannot go anywhere without first doing a thorough review of the literature. You picked a topic: now go to the library or to Google Scholar or something and read everything you can about that topic. Everything. This serves two purposes: you learn what research has already been done, and you get a foundation in your topic that will help you come up with a question and design your project. In the course of your readings you may come up with a question. Search for articles that may answer that question and, if you don't find any, keep searching a few more times just to be sure and, if you still don't find any, congratulations! You have a topic. Now do some research on methods that could be used to answer your question, and you're ready to start your experiments.Experiments done? Good. See which papers you read are close to the one you want to write, find the journal they were published in, see their submissiob guidelines, and write accordingly.Don't ever expect to be done with the reading, by the way: new research is always coming out, so reading literature is something you will be doing forever. If it's a topic you enjoy, however, you won't mind.While you're doing this, be sure to take notes! You will be citing all of these sources when you write your research paper, so be sure to record the citation information and the findings and useful information from each paper you read. I use Endnote, but there is other citation software out there.To give you an idea, in the past four years I have read (or at least skimmed or saw the abstract of) nearly 1000 papers related in some way to my research topic or methods, and another 150 on a side topic, and 75 on another side project. For a large review paper I wrote on yet another side topic, I read nearly 400 papers. I didn't / won't cite all of these in the papers I write (most papers have 30-40 citations or so), but to get enough information to know what has been done, what needs to be done, and how to do it all I have had to read a lot, and continue to do so.~~~Besides the literature review, running your experiment, writing and submitting of the paper, and the waiting while it gets reviewed and hopefully accepted for publication will take a long time. Your 4-6 month timeline is quite unrealistic unless you are doing something in the humanities or writing a review or commentary where lab work isn't needed."

263,"The common knowledge holds true, that nightmares are often a reflection of your waking mentalStressing about a looming unpleasantness, as well as anxiety from events passed can cause nightmares. Really traumatic events like car accidents or wars can lead to nightmares with recurring themes, or reliving the event over and over. Healing from the trauma should cause the nightmares to become less frequent and intense over time.If you‚Äôre among the 5% of people who have nightmares often enough to affect your waking hours, consider seeing a therapist.Nightmares can also be caused by medications or drugs, especially ones that affect neurotransmitters like antidepressants or narcotics.People who have what psychologists define as ‚Äúthin boundaries of the mind‚Äù are more prone to nightmares too. These people tend to be more creative and imaginative, and sometimes have trouble separating fantasy from reality. There are also idiopathic nightmares, meaning we don‚Äôt know why they happen, they just do.So if you have a nightmare every now and again, it‚Äôs nothing to worry about. 85% of adults report having nightmares on occasion. They‚Äôre more common for children, particularly young girls, and are likely caused when the child is struggling to cope with normal childhood fears.To understand nightmares, and to a larger extent dreams, it helps to know what‚Äôs happening in your thinking meat while you‚Äôre unconscious. Dreams and nightmares happen during REM (Rapid eye movement ), the last step in the sleep cycle before it starts over. During REM your brain becomes much more active than when you‚Äôre in deep sleep.Your amygdala in your temporal cortex starts humming along during REM, and that little guy is responsible for processing memory, decisions, and emotional reactions. And nightmares are a normal part of sleepIf you wake up due to nightmares more often that you‚Äôd like, or if you‚Äôre struggling to shake them off, there are a few things you can try to banish them from your bedroomStamp out your stress: try some belly breathing or meditation before bed.Don‚Äôt eat before bed: food can speed up your metabolism, which makes your brain more active during sleep.Stay away from scary stories, horror movies and these days‚Ä¶ the night time news!Keep a consistent bedtime routineGo to sleep and wake up at the same time each dayEnsure your bedroom is cool, dark and quiet"
264,"Squats are arguably the single greatest exercise any man can do. When the load is significant, essentially every muscle in the body is called upon to move the weight through the range of motion. The hamstrings, quads and glutes are the primary movers, while the core, upper, lower back and shoulders are forced to remain in a solid isometric state throughout the movement. A boost in testosterone is a nice effect of frequent heavy, deep squatting as well as a big hit on the cardiovascular system and mental toughness. Squats force you to dig deep. They are the single greatest exercise for athletic ability and they are hugely beneficial for overall health. The style of squat can be mixed up frequently to maximize the benefits. Hit back squats, low-bar squats, front squats, zercher squats with a barbell. Grab some kettlebells for double front racked squats or a single kettlebell goblet squat. Take a heavy sandbag for some zerchers, bear hug squats or some unilateral shoulder squats. Hell, even use a log... So, squat deep. Squat often and don't be afraid of squatting heavy. ‚Äã‚Äã"

266,"I'll toss in some of my 3 cents as well on hugely long cases.¬† People somehow tend to think the OR is a quiet and serene place; depending on the surgeon who is technically in control (not the anesthesiologist), it might be totally the opposite. In my OR I have music playing. We talk constantly about ""stuff,"" not necessarily about the procedure.¬† If the surgery is long but ""routine"" (and many of mine are), we tend to not even notice the time flying by.¬† If the procedure is not common, then we tend to flip and things get real quiet, so much so that everyone comments about it.¬† I even know of surgeons who have an RN start a IV in them so they don't dehydrate and lose focus or have to stop.¬† NOT ME!¬† For me, I had a special ""chair"" made that allows my weight to be shifted forward onto my ribs so I don't have it all on my back (my back is shot).¬†¬† I also scrub out routinely for potty breaks and even have food brought up so staff can eat.¬† The staff rotate in and out so they don't get too stressed.¬† For me the worst thing is not having my staff up to par.¬† If my staff are playing their A game then things go smoothly, so I do everything I can to make sure that happens.¬† No staff stress allowed!¬† I also do not allow Administration/Managers in the room.¬† I have my staff (made up of a half a dozen nurses and techs) plus the general run-of-the-mill staff, whoever is assigned, plus my resident(s), plus the anesthesia team.¬† Simple rule is if you can't play your A game, no penalties, no concern‚Äîjust scrub out and the others will take over.¬† They still get paid, they don't get yelled at, but at least they don't stress ME out, and the patient never suffers.¬† I also wear super comfortable clothes and shoes.¬† My ""chair,"" actually a leaner, has wheels so I roll all around, which I sometimes do to drive the gals crazy.¬† To me no expense is too great for the team since we do this 60-70 hours a week.¬† If staff want loupes they get them. If they want headlights they get them as well.¬† Special gloves‚Äîdone. Special masks or bubbles‚Äîdone.¬† I think the OR needs to be treated like a real theater with the team being actors in various roles.¬† My OR is dead serious but definitely a comedy/drama.¬† When I started (before the advent of staff litigation), we all used to ""act"" and talk just like we would at a BBQ or social event.¬† Jokes, stories, etc.¬† Now we need to tone it down a bit since some jokes are deemed inappropriate and the legal eagles frown on staff litigation.¬† Way too much TV and Hollywood has been imposed on the OR suite. It simply isn't true.¬† The only part that IS true is the grilling of the residents at the beginning of each case.¬† I want to make sure mine know what we are doing and I bust some buns on basics. Then, after that is done, we are just co-workers doing a job.¬† I also mandate that my patients are moved every 40 minutes so they don't get pinched nerves, occluded vessels, skin abrasions, blood clots, or the like.¬† We simply back up and let the nurses who are not operating along with the anesthesia team move the patient and we step (or roll) back in and start back up again.¬† This gives everyone a little break. ‚ÄîDr Dave"

Paid search, social media advertising and display advertising are all excellent ways of attracting visitors, building your brand and getting your site in front of people.2. Get SocialIt‚Äôs not enough to produce great content and hope that people find it ‚Äì you have to be proactive. One of the best ways to increase traffic to your website is to use social media channels to promote your content.3. Mix It UpThere is no magic formula for content marketing success, despite what some would have you believe. For this reason, vary the length and format of your content to make it as appealing.4. Write Irresistible HeadlinesHeadlines are one of the most important parts of your content. Without a compelling headline, even the most comprehensive blog post will go unread. Master the art of headline writing.5. Pay Attention to On-Page SEOThink SEO is dead? Think again. Optimizing your content for search enginesis still a valuable and worthwhile practice. Are you making the most of image alt text? Are you creating internal links to new content? What about meta descriptions? Optimizing for on-page SEO doesn‚Äôt have to take ages, and it could help boost your organic traffic.6. Target Long-Tail KeywordsGot your high commercial intent keyword bases covered?

Many of the female characters chosen are women filling roles typically associated with masculine characters (no nonsense, aggressive, gun-toting bad-asses). These characters are strong, to be sure, but many of them seem to be strong only because they are doing things that male characters typically do. I'd just like to nominate the following women from my favorite American TV drama of all time, The West Wing. Since it was an ensemble cast, none of these characters were technically the protagonist of the stories told on that show, but each displays a strength that is both genuine and rooted in femininity.C.J. Cregg (Allison Janney) for routinely going toe-to-toe with the entire White House press corps.Donna Moss (Janel Maloney) for routinely going toe-to-toe with her boss, the ever-arrogant, ever-brilliant Josh Lyman.Abbey Bartlet (Stockard Channing) for routinely going toe-to-toe with her husband, the President of the United States, Josiah Bartlet.Delores Landingham (Kathryn Joosten) for routinely going toe-to-toe with everyone who walked into the West Wing, not the least of which was her former boss' son, and current boss, President Bartlet. **Sorry.

276,"You have just entered your teenage so be prepared to face an awesome and worth remembering phase of your life and experience the best in the coming years. In this age you are turning from a child to an adult so from now you will be developed physically, mentally, emotionally and gain maturity. But to enjoy these changes you need to have a constant and reasonable amount of energy as you grow more. And this is your base age. If you stay feet and healthy at these ages then it will help you in long run and you will enjoy a long life. I would recommend you to exercise daily like morning walk , follow a routinely meal , eat until your stomach is totally full and not partly , join a gym if you like though it's not that much important, play outdoors , don't use electronics too much like computer games or TV or mobiles, eat limited spicy or junk foods , eat non veg (meat, eggs and fish) , drink a glass of milk everyday , if you have time do some meditation it will help you to have concentration and always think positive. At this age you need also to fight certain difficulties like bad friends teaching you bad habits or advising to take drugs or smoke or drink and if it happens consult to your parents immediately and try to stay under the eyes of teachers in school. Remember this age and the rest of teen ages have lots of good opportunities that will develop you and you will be better but there are some holes where if you get trapped your life will be ruined. So talk to your parents as friends and share everything you find awkard or bad and pay attention to your health and studies. Cheers !All the best :-)"

293,"I think it's interesting that only VCs and entrepreneurs jumped into this conversation. As a professional who has worked at several startups, I have a slightly different perspective.The good professionals who work at startups - the people you want to be at your startup - have goals that don't line up exactly with the founders' or investors' goals. Like the investors but perhaps unlike the founders, they need a huge exit (or a good salary), because their small ownership stakes (<0.1% for middle management, 1% for a vp) aren't going to be life-changing otherwise. Like the founders, but perhaps not like the investors, they need the intrinsic feeling of doing something good for the world (not just making other people comfortably well off). Unlike either founders or investors, they need professional growth, and this is perhaps the most important thing for a startup employee - and the main reason why you need to raise more money than you think. A resource starved environment that's just scraping by can't provide any of that, least of all professional growth.So, before you've proved the model, sure, bootstrap like mad, raise as little as possible, run on fumes, overwork everyone, etc. This is especially true for software startups where salaries are the primary expense, and not equipment, and where a couple of co-founders salaries represent a large portion of total expenses. But as soon as you find the market, if you want to attract and retain the best team, don't starve the business. Raise at least what you need to ensure you can attract and retain the best people.PS - Some examples: Twitter, Groupon, Evernote, EventBrite, Zynga, and FourSquare recently raised money have followed this path of finding the model, raising money, and stepping on the gas. And you can see it by looking at their jobs postings and hiring. And I've witnessed firsthand companies lose top talent from being resource starved, but I'll refrain from making examples of them here."
294,"Shri Arvind Kejriwal today has become the Vivek Oberoi of Indian Politics. High of promise - Higher in bravado - But low on focus and setting priorities.I knew Shri Kejriwal as an IIT‚Äôian from Kharagpur, who left a cozy job as the Joint Commissioner of Income Tax in New Delhi to start a social movement called Parivartan. He was quite famous among the students and almost a hero figure.I saw a guy who could have led a lavish life, with money, power and influence, who chose to walk instead through filth in the narrow lanes of Delhi‚Äôs Sunder Nagari, carrying a loudspeaker in his hands, singing jingles, teaching people about their rights and cleanliness.I saw Kejriwal picket outside the Delhi Electricity Board office, asking visitors not to pay bribes, offering to get their work done for free. I saw Kejriwal expose a PDS scam in Delhi, stall the privatisation of water supply, and get 700 poor kids admitted to costly private schools for free. I felt thankful. I also saw Kejriwal get involved with Anna hazare for the Right to Information act movement bringing to us the right to ask questions directly to our government.I saw Shri Arvind Kejriwal receive the Ramon Magsaysay award for Emergent Leadership.Then came the 2011 India Against Corruption movement or the Jan Lokpal Movement - I saw Kejriwal along with Anna Hazare become household names. There was a huge momentum of national support - the Indian Media played ball - they really captured the imagination of the young and the restless.Then came the Political Party and off went Anna Hazare.One of my dearest friends from college, decided to shut down his business in Bengaluru for 3 months to help distribute pamphlets for the new born party.Donations and volunteers trickled in from around the world. They even won 28/70 seats in the Delhi assembly elections defeating the incumbent Chief Minister Shiela Dixit and the Minister of Telecom, Kapil Sibal.All eyes were on the most popular new chief minister of India - the world media was all ears and camera. It was time to deliver. And then we saw this:Shri Arvind Kejriwal was still in the protest mode. He cried, slept outside government offices and resigned on Valentine‚Äôs Day of 2014.But the momentum wasn‚Äôt lost. In the following general elections, AAP won 4 parliamentary seats in Punjab, which was followed by a thumping 67/70 seats in the Delhi Assembly elections. Shri Kejriwal was on a new high.This was the time to seize the opportunity and deliver a governance like no other. Shri Kejriwal had the men, means and the media to accomplish this task and all he needed was a focussed 30 month stint of ‚ÄúBadlav‚Äù (Translation: Change). He could have used his time to strengthen his cadre base in different states while building a model state in Delhi - keeping his higher moral ground.But we get this:Instead of being a model Chief minister in India, Shri Arvind Kejriwal decided to focus his attention on Narendra Modi. He perhaps thought, positioning himself as the Opposition-in Chief to Modi might earn him the PMs job sooner. But he ill-chose his issues, becoming a mere jester instead of a serious challenger:He was just seen slamming Modi, name calling, shooting and scooting, taking U turns, cancelling A R Rahman concerts because of a fatwa while inviting Ghulam Ali to perform in Delhi, giving reviews of latest blockbusters and basically doing everything that he protested against - earlier:Today, the bubble of Shri Arvind Kejriwal has been pricked by his own actions. The opportunities in Goa and Punjab have come and gone - perhaps with a lesson to first bring one‚Äôs own house in order, before they point a finger at others.We always waited for a day when a well educated common man enters politics and gives a tough time to the regular politicians. Now we are waiting for a day, when Shri Kejriwal does a final ‚ÄòU‚Äô turn and decides to focus on being an awes..."

300,"First, I have to ask ""why do you want to start a business in civil construction?"" Saying ""there is no link.."" makes me wonder.How do you know that this is the type of business that you want to start??While I am not saying that every business should only be in a field that you know, it is difficult enough to start a business - it is even more challenging to build it on a new product or service.. For the sake of argument let's say that you have a degree or some related experience. You probably have worked with someone who has some connection to the industry.If you still do not, then this becomes more like asking ""how do I reach the moon?"" when you haven't even built the first rocket.By the time President Kennedy set the ambitious goal in the 1960's there had already been hundreds of rockets launched. It was just a matter of time and building on past successes and lessons.So, here's the thing.. Stephen Shady offers some good basic advice about going into civil construction. I'd recommend taking a closer look at why you think this is where you want to go. Seek out people in your network who may know someone in a related field. Even if your friends or connections do not know a person directly, they will likely help you get closer.Take the time to know them and seek to add value first. https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/make-your-linkedin-success-mantra-value-before-reward-john-chang?trk=prof-postEven if you find it difficult to connect in person, the world is smaller because of technology. LinkedIn is the #1 professional network here. Maybe there's a similar site where you live. Meetup is also excellent for meeting like minds.Most of all, be open to possibilities that you may have not imagined."
301,"Time deposits mean the money is deposited for a specific time period or term. Compared to Savings Accounts, the interest rates are more in these accounts. The rates are slightly more for Senior Citizens i.e citizens with age more than 60 years.Term deposits are popular with investors who prefer capital security and a set return as opposed to the fluctuations of, say, the share market.As explained in our article Different Types of Bank Accounts in India These Deposits have two further sub-categories, as follows:Fixed DepositsRecurring DepositsFIXED DEPOSITSMoney is deposited in these accounts for a time span ranging from seven days to ten years, with an interest rate which is fixed on the day of the investment.Money is a deposited in a lump sum or one time.A person can withdraw the money deposited in the fixed deposits by paying a small fine, which is again set by the bank. This is called breaking the FD.A sample FD receipt from our article Overview of Fixed Deposits is shown belowFixed Deposit or FD certificateRECURRING DEPOSITS‚ÄúBoond boond se sagar banata hai‚Äù (little drops of water make an ocean) As per this saying, small but periodic investments can grow to a large sum at maturity. This is the basic investment logic behind recurring deposit schemes.Unlike fixed deposits, in Recurring deposits, banks accept deposits from customers in instalments, at regular intervals. So, suppose if a person has decided upon depositing the money in ten instalments, then the bank will not accept it in eleven or nine.In Recurring Deposits, the time span varies from six months to ten years.The amount of deposits varies and can start from as low as Rs. 50.The interest rate will be approved by the bank, and it will be compounded every quarter (i.e. every three months)."

303,"Hi, this is my answer to some other question but it fits perfectly for this question as well.I am 22 years old and very young to answer this question. But still I wanna give it a try.First of all finding a purpose of life is like dividing a 'zero' by another 'zero', which is off course meaningless. But to find out that, it is meaningless one should try it first.I will say, ""experience"" is another name for life. But while having experiences, the one who understands that time is infinite and beyond the reach of man, will understand the life.So, why God has sent you here in first place?You have been sent to make world more beautiful and amazing.There are too many things to see, too many things to experience but very little time, so experience them as much as you can.Possibilities are endless. You can do anything. You can become anything. You can change this world.Everyday try something new, learn something new.It is always better to regret by doing it rather than regretting without doing it.Experience is valuable. Experience everything but don't get addicted to anything.Experience will teach you to differentiate between good and bad, right and wrong.Don't be afraid of committing mistakes, because only those will make mistake who will try something different, something new.Take responsibility for your mistakes, try to improve and forgive the mistakes of others.Treat everyone the way you treat yourself. Be as lenient to others as you are to yourself.Respect everyone and most importantly love everyone.Love is very sparse in this world and everyone needs it.Don't hesitate to ask for love as well as don't hesitate to show your love.Life is too short to be shy, dance like there is no tomorrow, sing with all your heart, eat as much as you can, lough loudly and always cry like a baby.Only your body should grow old not your heart.The day you loose innocence, you loose your life.Think about future but don't worry about it.Think about past but don't get lost in it.There will be good days and bad days. Don't boast in good days and don't loose hope in bad days.Don't give all credits to yourself in success, and don't blame others in failure.Keep moving forward, spread happiness and again make this world more beautiful and amazing.Thank you!!!"

306,"You accidentally filled your petrol vehicle with diesel, I assume you filled it up to the brim and your car was almost empty prior to that. I'm assuming also that you are of average literacy mechanically and you're seeking a DIY solution.1st on the agenda is to drain all the contaminated fuel out of the fuel tank. Check if your tank has a drain plug underneath and use that to drain( might need to raise the vehicle in this case), if not, you have to check if it's fuel injection or carburated. If fuel injected, locate the fuel pump relay on the fuse box and plug it out. Disconnect the fuel supply line to the fuel rail and extend it to a container suitable for containing fuel.On the fuel pump relay connector, bridge terminals that correspond to terminal 30 and 87 on the relay. Most relays are labeled. You are effectively pumping your contaminated fuel out of the fuel tank. When the fuel runs out, there's about three or so litres left in the tank but don't stress. You can put 5 litres of petrol and drain again.Now change the petrol filter(in-line) if equipped, and connect everything as was. Fill up the tank with the correct fuel. Crank up the car and it should catch after a few tries if not immediately.In case of a carburated vehicle, look for a cheap under car high pressure fuel pump and connect it to the fuel delivery line as close to the tank as possible. Disconnect the supply line to the carburetor/s and extend it to a container. Note that the pressure from a high pressure pump can damage your carbs.Connect the pump to a power source(use crocodile clips at the battery). When tank is empty add 5 litres of the correct fuel and drain again.Go at the carb/s and drain fuel in the reservoir. Most carbs do have drain plugs for that. If you don't find the drain, cycle the accelerator about 20 times to dump the contaminated fuel into the engine. Fully press accelerator and crank engine like you do on a flooded vehicle to vent off the fuel from the engine.Connect everything as it was and fill up the tank with the correct fuel. Crank the vehicle and it'll catch after a few tries."
307,"There are many diverse fields and positions in which a Bachelor's Degree in Sociology will allow the door to open to you. These include the obvious government social worker positions, such as providing case management services to clients within the system, in need of Section 8 housing assistance, welfare or food stamp benefits, or you could assist with government sponsored job-training services and employment rehabilitation counseling,¬† as well as many other positions within the field of counseling-- if that is something that sparks your interest. You could find work at many prisons, juvenile detention facilities, drug rehabilitation centers or mental health care institutions. You could also find work as a middle, junior or high school guidance counselor, as a residential counselor at a home for troubled teens, or as an emergency services care coordinator for abused women at a shelter, or become involved in foster care administration. The medical industry is a large employer, as many hospitals and other health care centers and providers retain workers with Sociology degrees as Patient Services/Insurance coordinators or Social Service/Health Care liaisons, to make sure that all patients are being treated fairly and receiving all aspects of the proper care available to them. This might entail seeing that patients get insurance approval for necessary tests or medications, assisting with information or paperwork for patients applying for government benefits; it could also include duties such as an intervention of parental custody when the patient is a newborn infant, with positive drug testing results. Funeral homes, large hospitals and hospices are another option for work as a grief counseling specialist. If your interests in sociology work are less suited to the ""social"" aspect of the field, and lie more closely aligned to the research aspect of the field, then you might be happier to seek employment within the medical, scientific and clinical research industry firms employed as a research labratory assistant, institutional research analyst, or a quantitative data coder. You could analyze data or conduct quantative and qualitative research studies, working as a junior project director in market research. You could become an assistant program director at the YMCA. Advertising and public relations firms could value your input as a field researcher or market trend analyst. Political campaigns services coordinator or field researcher is another position suited to¬† a degree in Sociology. This is just a small sampling of what might be possible with a Bachelor's Degree in this field; it is an unbelievably diverse field with unlimited potential! Good luck to you!"
308,"There‚Äôs a bromide among mathematicians about calculus texts: They are all isomorphic. The term ‚Äúisomorphic‚Äù roughly means that not only do two things have the same - or pretty much indistinguishable - objects (content), but the relations between the objects are the same as well.So if it‚Äôs big, thick and says ‚ÄúCalculus‚Äù (bummer on that 3rd count girls) - it‚Äôs a duck.I‚Äôll cautiously recommend a terrible book on calculus. It‚Äôs small and thin: Calculus Made Easy by Silvanus Thompson. It was written way back in 1910 by a Brit who delights in repeating ‚ÄúWhat one fool can learn, another can.‚ÄùThe big stumbling block(s) in calculus is/are the concepts of ‚Äúlimits‚Äù and ‚Äúcontinuity‚Äù. It‚Äôs the rare student that ‚Äúgets it‚Äù the first time around. And I would say that is mostly because it can be made to sound very simple and reasonable by a skilled instructor. Thompson‚Äôs introduction to these concepts in about the first 20 pages is not, for my two cents, easy reading and doesn‚Äôt help that much. I got through it and most of the rest of the book seemed a breeze. Once he quit blathering about limits ‚Äúin theory‚Äù and actually started using the concepts intuitively on the big problems of calculus (slope and area) - very easy reading.I read it cover to cover and it let me successfully challenge all but the last calculus class while going straight into differential equations. Two full years of math my first quarter. With that stellar start, I went down hard when I tried to move on to advanced calculus. If you want to be a mathematician, that should be a consideration. If you just want to learn the nuts and bolts of calculus with a crude idea of why it all works, Thompson‚Äôs book is OK or even fantastic.I‚Äôll add there is one more thing that is critical to success in calculus: Algebra skills. If your ability to manipulate algebraic expressions (accurately) isn‚Äôt good to excellent - no calculus book ever written will help you.Good luck!"
309,"The fact that i am answering this, and not anonymously, makes me feel a hell lot better.6 amazing years, that is how long it was before this ‚Äúbreakup story‚Äù gets made. Increasingly finding her busy in her work, i had gotten into a habit of giving her her space, which she asked more and more of. She worked for an IT firm, sometimes 8 in the morning to 11 till night. Allow me to remind you that this is the same girl who would not sit for an hour straight, even in an ice-cream parlour.We had waded through a rough patch before and i was sure, we were meant to be together. Long term relationships can‚Äôt be possessive, or they turn sour. Thankfully, we were past all the muck. We had planned our engagement in December - she was always keen on the ‚Äúforever after‚Äù stuff. I had never been more glad to comply. It was November when it all started. Her father had a heart attack and she started travelling to her hometown, which was a night away from her workplace, almost every other weekend. One time she went home asking me to not call, lest her parents get worried over us. I waited, like anyone would. There were moments when i felt terribly alone but refrained from calling (I had been posted to Gujarat and for the first time in my life was at complete loss of like minded people). It was a fortnight later that i got her call. Her father was better and she was back at her workplace. But our engagement was off for a while.In any healthy relationship, you talk, no matter what. We hadn‚Äôt been talking like we used to for a while now,3 months to be exact. In February.finally free from her project, she called me to her city to meet her. And we did meet. Just like we always did - madly in love, laughing our guts out, together. Nothing had changed. I felt so stupid for being paranoid about us.That same evening she had to leave for her hometown owing to her father‚Äôs health. As requested, i waited for her call and did not disturb her. I did leave messages though inquiring about her father. It took her a week to return to her workplace and when she did, she bombed me with a lot of previously untouched subjects - like how unsupportive, mean and uncaring i had been to her. This phase continued for over a week. Eventually i realised, this wasn‚Äôt her stress speaking. That night i got a call from an unknown girl. There are moments in our lives that we remember so vividly that we can recount them as if they just happened. This phone call was one such moment for me. She refused to tell me her name but every word she said, i remember clear as a crystal.My dearest had been visiting some US based guy in her hometown and their families had agreed upon their marriage. Apparently, money supersedes all. This stranger girl whom i shall never know just gave me the rudest shock of my life and saved me from a greater one. What followed was confrontation - she was someone else entirely, all since that one moment when i asked her if this was true. ‚ÄúSorry‚Äù was all i got, to lead my life on, without the person who i thought was central to my existence. After everything, she wanted me to be a part of her life as the person who knew her best.Now all of us, or say, most of us have this inbuilt mental circuit that calls out the crap. Mine just beeped madly :) I had had enough. That was it.What followed was three months of isolation and a substantial self harm. Different people deal with things differently. That was my way; not proud of it. One thing that this simple girl was adamant about, in our playful banters was a platinum ring with one diamond for her engagement. That brings me to today - saw her facebook page with engagement pics.Well, even she never had it!Few people live their dreams. I just wasn‚Äôt so lucky. So what?P.S.: On a lighter note, i bought a KTM Duke and will be riding to Laddakh. God bless her for the breakup. I just got gifted with time, money and freedom while she got a boring nerd for life:D"

313,"It depends if it's going to be at the church ceremony, and how strict the rules are in that particular church. At my country church weddings are viewed as a service at church, so anything performed in the ceremony needs¬† preferably to have a religious message. It's recommended to have the choice discussed with the church musician who is playing at the ceremony (and usually accompanies). If you have a civil ceremony or if the song performed at the reception, you can pick any love song that fits the voice and the couple likes.For the church ceremony Panis Angelicus by Franck is popular, or any Ave Maria (there are plenty..Schubert, Bach/Gounod, Caccini etc). You can find arrangements in different keys to fit the singer.Knowing the context in the original opera, I wouldn't pick ""Mon coeur"" aria that was suggested in another answer for a wedding. Dalila is evil character. (Admitted that most listeners will not have this association though)."
314,"Each of us have things we're supposed to learn in our lives. But as you've requested, I won't lecture on positivity and living rather on the reasons behnd where you are at this moment in time while not ignoring the pain you've experienced in your life to this point.As I stated in my comments because those invariably are part of the whole picture, what I was able to determine from the chart you initially posted, I knew you must have been born around October 26/27, 1986 depending on the nation where you were born. Your vocabulary made me suspect you were from India, which explains to me why I expected you were born in the early morning hours there.I knew at once that you were in the midst of your Saturn Return although what's known as the perfected conjunction (0¬∞) has passed now. On the other hand, the coming year will be equally important as you have the opportunity to wade through your own issues. Now here's where I said in my initial comments above, ""many people fall into a deep depression during this period especially when they have had challenges in their lives that somehow directly impacted self-esteem.""By transit, you've been taking a beating, I know: Pluto has been transiting your 4th house of the home while Uranus has been in your house of marriage and other long-term relationships. But while you have a Libra rising that would tend to make many people relationship-oriented, I get the sense that your need for relationships is more about yourself, that you would rather people just let you be instead of trying to give you their expectations of you. Your natal Venus is retrograde, which makes you very cautious and reserved. You're not only a Scorpio Sun, but you have Pluto conjunct the Sun. You would rather--as you always have--be able to get across to people that you don't need or want their pressure because you're still going to march to your own beat anyway. You're extremely private and independent, and the only thing that will occasionally make you come out of your shell is when you're speaking with friends often in frustrated anger. I'm guessing the closest friends are--or even just one friend is--likely to be female who would understand this need to be yourself, the need for your own self-expression rather than what everyone else tells you to do. I have absolutely no doubt that your self-esteem through the years has taken an especially rough toll on you: It's rough enough to have Venus retrograde in Scorpio in your second house, but here's also where you have Mercury in Scorpio and Saturn in Sagittarius (although Saturn will be considered technically in the 3rd house of every day happenings). Now your Mars-Pluto square isn't all there is. In fact, your Mars (actually in the 5th house) is in opposition to the 11th house Moon in Leo. This duo forms a fixed T-square to the arm--Sun-Pluto conjunction. Your Sun is clearly in the 1st house while Pluto is in the 2nd because of its proximity to the 2nd house. As a result, that arm points to both who you are, the first impressions you give and the self-image even that you have developed as a result of what's going on with your 2nd house. I find this chart quite fascinating since your Jupiter is also forming what's called a 20-minute partile conjunction to your 6th house cusp and is therefore considered in your 6th house. It's also squaring your natal Saturn, a highly significant point since this now ties in to your Saturn Return as well as what I call The Peeling of Life's Onion: the transiting aspects of Saturn in Sagittarius in square to Neptune in Pisces (preparing to conjunct your natal Jupiter from now through 2018). The good news is the Saturn-Neptune ""Peeling of Life's Onion"" hard aspect will be over by December 2016. I didn't ask you where you live now even though I had later thought of looking at your Solar Return and the progressions. But what's here makes me believe that your family may be pressuring you into marriage despite that you're probably more likely to want to avoid that journey altogether. You're too independent and really would be likely to prefer to make your own choices whether or not anyone else understands. From what I see here, these feelings seem to be extremely intense and enough to make you dig your heels in with every effort to manipulate your decisions in others' directions. For what it's worth, I'm so sorry to see all of this. It seems like they will stop pressuring you to fall in step with them after your next birthday, and that will most likely be in lne with when Saturn moves out of hard aspect to Neptune in December. It seems like the pressure amounts to your love probably for (I'm taking a stab here) your mother and how you'd really prefer not to disappoint her; but your life is truly your own and you wish others would get this.I thought about what you asked--""I want to die soon. I can't live on this wretched planet anymore. Why did I have to suffer so much in my life? How much struggle is still left? When will I be set free from this forced existence?""--and I will tell you two things about this: First, the chart lives on after we're gone so it's not that easy to look at the chart and say, ""Yes! Here it is!"" And frankly, anyone who tells you that really is not being fair because they're influencing your free will when this may actually not be the right time for you to leave. (I also know you're aware of karmic law here.) Secondly, my own code of ethics which I believe is in alignment with many other astrologers in the world prevents me from seeing the chart with that request about when you will leave this lifetime in mind. It's directly related to your chart living on after death. It is your journey. It's also your responsibility to live your life. Does that mean you have to give in to the demands of others to do things they may insist on when it's your life? No. But you have a responsibility to yourself, your life. The biggest thing you have in your favor is time. I'll ask for nothing more than your granting time permission to work in your favor for a change. It will."
315,"Trigonometry was created before Claudius Ptolemy (ca. 85‚Äìca. 165), but a lot of it is due to him.¬† He proved a theorem, now called Ptolemy Theorem, which gives a formula for trig functions for sums of angles.With that, he created a table of chords for every half degree.¬† He didn't use sines or cosines, which came later, but Chords.¬† He placed an angle AOB at the center of a large circle of fixed radius, and the chord of the angle was the length of the straight line connecting A to B.Sines were created later. The sine of an angle is half the length of the chord of twice the angle.So, if Ptolemy wasn't the creator of trig, who was?Hipparchus (190‚Äì120) preceded Ptolemy by two and a half centuries, and was mentioned by Ptolemy. He produced the first trigonometric table for use in astronomy, but it wasn't as detailed as Ptolemy's.¬† It was also a table of chords for angles in a circle of large fixed radius, but he didn't use degrees. His table was much coarser and used ‚Äústeps‚Äù, each step being 1/24 of a circle.¬† (So a step was 7.5¬∞.)¬† That's not a very long table having only a dozen entries.Hipparchus was an astronomer, and it may be that he was the first one to use a table of trig functions."
316,"Imagine you don't like pizza. The guy you are dating really likes it so you say you love pizza to make him like you.You don't like pizza and end up eating pizza often rather than speaking up.You risk ending up angry at him for always picking pizza. Your anger builds up. You can't see it now but you are not angry at him. You are angry at yourself. This is people pleasing.Now imagine you don't like pizza and all your friends like it. You say you don't like pizza, but you like spending time with them so decide that you can be flexible, that this time you can set your preferences aside to be accommodating.That's being nice.I understand how this can be a fine line but the first will make you feel used and resentful and diminished and the second will make you happy because you own where you stand and are being generous.People pleasing is not about making things easier for others but rather involves compromising who you are. It means trying to make everyone happy at your expense and realizing that despite your effort it cannot be done.It's a losing battle to play against yourself. It's sacrificing you to such an extent you lose track of who you are. That's not nice. Nice begins by being nice to yourself."
317,"Countries do two very important things. They become more open. The build relationships among rest of the countries in the world and try to be part of one world. They do it through trade, partnerships and through human relationships, arts etc.They have to govern their countries well and satisfy their people's aspirationsThey strengthen their internal defense. Their intention is that their internal and external forces don't threaten their governments.Being a responsible member of United Nations that works well to ensure peace in the world.The above don't ensure that they can successfully prevent war. If relationships between countries are not strong, it could lead to war. They should have open trade. Trade is opposed to war. So, all countries should trade and interact with other countries well.There is no need to stress about the importance of good governance. When the leaders of the country don't govern well, people in the countries may revolt. While it is important for countries to strengthen their internal defense, it is not good if the military strength becomes too strong. Because some eccentric leaders may decide to misuse it. Which is why we need the fourth point - A strong United nations with responsible members will be capable of ensuring peace in the world. It requires some reforms in the United nations.This is something I believe: We need a strong country like US to be the police of the world. Without it some dictators will torment their people or unnecessarily wage war against other countries. Of course, the global policeman should have some kind of a control. Presently the citizens of USA can keep a check on their leaders. But it is not most effective. What is required is some reforms in UN so that there is good democracy in it."
318,"I was raised with a lot of privilege. I‚Äôm not trying to deny it. But you know what the massive side dish is that comes with privilege? Delusion. You always expect more food to magically appear on your plate, without so much as leaving the table.One of the most common, yet most dangerous illusions my generation secretly indulges in is the idea of becoming a billionaire.Go ahead. Feel it. Deep down. It‚Äôs there.‚ÄúI‚Äôll become a billionaire.‚ÄùAs if it was just a matter of when. If you just felt a slight tingle, I have a few questions for you. Questions for future billionaires.1. What‚Äôs your good reason for wanting to make a billion?I like David Blaine‚Äôs idea that success is giving as much as you get.He says what makes Bill Gates so great is that he‚Äôs figured out how to give the money he‚Äôs amassed to worthy causes better than most institutions can. Polio‚Äôs almost eradicated. Next, he‚Äôs going after Guinea worm disease.If the only place you want to direct the money is into your own pocket, you‚Äôll never think broad enough to reach a billion.‚ÄúTo make a billion dollars, help a billion people.‚Äù ‚Äì Peter Diamandis2. What‚Äôs your real reason for wanting to make a billion?Now that we‚Äôve got the noble cause out of the way, why do you really need the money? What happiness can a billion buy you that 100 million can‚Äôt? That 10 million can‚Äôt? That one million can‚Äôt?It‚Äôs just another arbitrary number. What‚Äôs not arbitrary is the psychological hole you‚Äôre hoping it‚Äôll fill. Where‚Äôs the hole?Are you insecure? Lonely? Do you lack self-worth? Self-love? Who do you want to prove wrong? Yourself? The world?It‚Äôs okay. Just like the idea of becoming a billionaire itself, when you dig deep enough, you‚Äôll realize it‚Äôs there. We all have it. But know it‚Äôs there.‚ÄúThere‚Äôs always a good reason and there‚Äôs always a real reason.‚Äù ‚Äì James Altucher3. How are you going to make your billion?Seriously. Do the math. The real, serious math. We‚Äôre not talking about revenue here. We‚Äôre talking about profit. Profit you can pocket.What does a billionaires bank account even look like? Is there ever a billion on there? I have no idea. And neither do you.Only 3% of billionaires made their money from running private companies. Can you take a company from zero to IPO? How big is your total market? Is there even a billion in there?‚ÄúIf past history was all there was to the game, the richest people would be librarians.‚Äù‚Äì Warren Buffett4. Who‚Äôs going to make your billion for you?That‚Äôs right. Not with you. For you. You have to be aware that in the end, that‚Äôs what‚Äôs happening. Everyone you hire along your journey will partly be responsible for making your billion. And you will hire people. You have to.These people will work with you. But they‚Äôll make money for you. Tell me: Why should they? Tell them. You better have a compelling reason. A good offer.What are you going to give back? What are you going to do for them?‚ÄúHelp young people. Help small guys. Because small guys will be big.‚Äù ‚Äì Jack Ma5. When do you expect your billion?If the answer is anything less than 20 years from now, you can stop right here. Warren Buffett became a millionaire just before turning 30. He first was a billionaire at 56. That‚Äôs 26 years, starting from millionaire status.Are you a millionaire yet? No? Whoops. That‚Äôs just the first part. But even that‚Äôs ridiculously hard.And don‚Äôt you dare tell me about Mark Zuckerberg. You‚Äôre not Mark Zuckerberg. Mark Zuckerberg isn‚Äôt reading this. Neither would you be, if you were already seriously working on your billion.‚ÄúI‚Äôm here to build something for the long-term. Anything else is a distraction.‚Äù ‚Äì Mark Zuckerberg6. What are you willing to give up for your billion?If being a billionaire is your number one goal, think about number two. You will not get number two. Or three. Or four. The bigger the goal, the bigger the sacrifice.0.0000272% of all humans are billionaires. They gave up not one, but all the things that make the other 99.99% of people what they are - the other 99.99% of the people.Whatever you think you can also have, next to being a billionaire, you most likely can‚Äôt. We‚Äôre not talking about giving up watching football here.Are you willing to be a bad father for your billion? An absent mother? Are you willing to lose your girlfriend? Or all your friends? Would you give up family? Sleep? Food for a week?Most importantly: Are you willing to give up being understood by every single person you know?‚ÄúI was set free, because my greatest fear had already been realized, and I was still alive, and I still had a daughter whom I adored, and I had an old typewriter and a big idea. And so rock bottom became the solid foundation on which I rebuilt my life.‚Äù ‚Äì J.K. RowlingPrivilege is a sweet syrup. There‚Äôs lots to gain from savoring it. Delusion is the bitter taste it leaves in your mouth when you get used to it.So here‚Äôs one last piece of bark to chew on.

321,"I think it‚Äôs important to understand some basics about black money before judging this giant decision by the government.When we hear ‚ÄòBlack money‚Äô what most of us imagine is this:And conclude that this is ‚Äòevil‚Äô or ‚Äòbad‚Äô and hence must be cleaned up. And that is all there is to ‚ÄòBlack money‚Äô.The truth is this hoard of cash might be completely legitimate, even if it hidden under a bed - if it has been disclosed to the government and taxes have been paid for it. Then it is white moneyMoney = Cash?I might store all my money(black or white) in bank deposits, or in the form of cash at home - if that makes me happy. I might use it for charitable purposes or to throw a booze party or for a lavish wedding. That‚Äôs my right.Money can take the form of cash, real estate, gold or whatever.The only question which makes it black or white is: Have the requisite taxes been paid?If taxes are not paid, then it becomes black money. Now I need to hide this money. Surely bank deposits are not a good idea! If I buy something using this money I need to hide that too. So I buy big things in somebody else‚Äôs name(benami transactions), stash it in offshore accounts(which promise secrecy), invest in real estate(by showing lesser value) etc.Note that the cash component is a small part of the total money - especially If I have huge amounts of black money. It is simply impractical to hoard it all in cash.So ‚Äòmoney‚Äô is NOT the same as CashSo when we say our stated aim is ‚ÄòTo curb black money‚Äô we are not just hunting for hoards of cash. We are not even hunting for people with lots of real estate, or politicians who have a lot of gold. People can legitimately hold on to all that.We are hunting for hoards of cash, or people with lots of real estate, or politicians who have a lot of gold - who have not paid the taxes on it. And then collect those taxes. And perhaps impose heave penalties to prevent recurrence.But even this catches existing black money. The real solution is to make everybody pay taxes. But maybe catching existing black cash is also a good first step‚Ä¶So let‚Äôs analyse how useful this step is.Coming to demonetisation, two things to understand:It directly affects only the cash component of money. Not the real estate, gold etc. that I have. And that too, the part that is in form of 500 or 1000 notes.It affects black and white cash. You and me had white money but still were forced to deposit it in banks.So to judge effectiveness of the demonetisation scheme, we should try to calculate how much of the money is in CASH, and is black, and will be collected - and compare it against the total black money.A - Domestic black money‚ÄúAs Schneider estimates, using the dynamic multiple-indicators multiple-causes method and by currency demand method, that the size of India's black money economy is between 23 and 26%‚ÄùSource: Indian black money - WikipediaLet us assume it is 25%‚ÄúThe Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in India was worth 2073.54 billion US dollars in 2015‚ÄùSource: India GDPThis translates to 141 Lakh crores. 25% of this is about 35 Lakh crores.B - Offshore black money‚ÄúIn March 2012, the government of India clarified in its parliament that the CBI director's statement on $500 billion of illegal money[in foreign tax havens] was an estimate based on a statement made to India's Supreme Court in July 2011‚Äù Source: Indian black money - WikipediaThis translates to about 34 Lakh croresTotal black money = A + B = 35 + 34 = 69 Lakh croresThe question now is: How much of this black money is in cash and circulating inside India in form of 500 and 1000 Rs notes, which the demonetisation scheme might recover?C - Total currency in 500 and 1000 Rs. notes = 14 Lakh crores‚Äúthe annual report of Reserve Bank of India (RBI) of 31 March 2016 stated that total bank notes in circulation valued to ‚Çπ16.42 lakh crore (US$240 billion) of which nearly 86% (around ‚Çπ14.18 lakh cror..."

323,"Because people are ignorant - no scientist, nutritionist, or biologist would say that.Carnivore means that an animals nutrients are provided mostly by animal sources - whether through predation or scavenging. It does not mean that they are obligate carnivores (cannot survive without meat in the diet) and it does not mean that they never eat plants. It means that as near as we can tell looking at wild counterparts diets (wolves), dentition, etc they are 100% carnivores.Dogs do have a gene that wolves do not have which allows for better absorption of nutrients from starchy plants (potatoes, rice, etc). However, this does not alter their classification as a carnivore.This is a deer - a classic herbivore. It is eating meat:This is a cat, an obligate carnivore that will die if not fed meat. It is eating a plant:This is a dog, it is a carnivore. It is eating pizza:Just because an animal can eat something does not reclassify them as a carnivore/omnivore/herbivore. You look at the behavior or the animals in the wild about what makes up the majority of their diet. Wild wolves, coyotes, etc, somes eat feces, insects, and wild fruits, but the vast majority of their nutritional needs are met by meat. You can buy your dog a ‚Äúvegan kibble‚Äù and if it has the right and properly digestible nutrients the dog can survive, but that doesn‚Äôt make it a soy-a-vore."
324,"Yes. Semi-long term. 6 years. Married for 4. Separated at 3. Tried again for a year to no avail. I left, ran away with my first love, flew back to get a bag for Europe and then once more to sign the divorce papers. It was very peaceful. I cried more than he did. I knew I was going to miss my friend. A lot. He was with his new wife within four months. They're happily married (I think). My boyfriend and I are still happily together. It's been almost three yeas. Things worked out best for all parties. It happens. Don't let people tell you it doesn't."

326,"The best food I have eaten is a very specific type of Idly called Mallige Idly. By this sentence most Indians will know that I am a south Indian. Anyway, almost a month back, there was a war going on twitter. Gordon Ramsay v/s South Indians. Just because he said our every day food which is Idly and vada looked like prison food for him.. Frankly speaking, it hurt me.. Because I am no prisoner and the food I eat is in fact so healthy that many hospitals serve them on a daily basis to its patients and many doctors recommend this to be consumed on a daily basis as it causes zero affect on health. But, I am least bothered as I know what Idly is made of and how tasty it is and he is the one who is at loss as he will never be able to taste what we taste.Moving on let me describe how this became my favorite food.. As long as i remember, my mom used to make terrible Idlies.. They were full of rava and i hated it (sorry mom). So I could hardly eat idly. But, it was twice a week mandatory breakfast at our place.. we had to eat it as breakfast and then take it to school for lunch.. But, at school i would eat other‚Äôs lunch to satisfy my taste buds..I am from Mysore, so the famous festival Dasara gives us a lot of opportunity to have variety of food.. There will be fair and exhibits of lot of stuff which can be bought and also lot of tasty food.. Its called ‚ÄúMysuru Dasara exhibition‚Äù.We used to go there every year as there will be lot of games to play for children (which I wanted to to back then). When I was 9 or 10 years old we were walking in the exhibition, looking around for something exciting to eat with my mom and my brother.. My mom saw that there is a stall of ‚ÄúMysore Mallige Idly‚Äù. So she took us there. She ordered 2 plates of Mallige Idly. One for her and me and one more for my elder brother.. As I used to waste a lot of food back then, she wanted me to taste it first..Maillige idly usually will be served with 2 or 3 types of chutney as shown in the below photo.But, the size and shape of the mallige idly was not like the one in the photo. Just to give you a rough idea.. Have a look at the below picture which shows the thickness of a idly.But, a mallige idly will be 1.5 times thicker that the one in the picture. A lot softer, in fact it will be so soft few people call it sponge idly.. literally it will be like a sponge if to try squeezing it.. but it will not be chewey at all.. it will just melt in the mouth..So, continuing the story. My mom smeared some red chutney and some green chutney and a broken piece of Mallige idly and gave it to me for tasting.. Just for me to decide, if I wanted it or not.. I just put it in my mouth and the flavours of red chilly, ginger, garlic, coconut, coriander, curry leaves, Roasted gram (Hurigadale), with occasional encounter of muster seeds, along with all these the the soft soft mallige idly started bursting in my mouth.. It just melted like butter in my mouth.. I felt like i just visited heaven..I had never tasted anything like that before.. So, i ended up eating 3 or 4 plates of mallige idly that day.. My mom had to call it a day and drag me out of that place..Since then, my mom kept trying and trying to make those idlies. But, till date she hasn‚Äôt been successful.. But, the idly of hers has improved a lot.. now i like my mom‚Äôs idlies..But, after that, over the period of several years, I have tried Mallige idlies at several places none of them were like the one that i ate that day.. I used to hunt for Mallige idlies in and around mysore but, dint find anything even close to that.. One of my uncle said there is one place near pandavapura (Mandya district) where, in a small house one old man prepares mini idlies which tastes similar to mallige idly.. Immediately I told my dad (he is my partner for all kinds of food exploration, we always keep each other updated on ‚ÄúNew good places to eat in Mysore‚Äù he is a big time foodie) that we should go there.. so the next day morning we left mysore by 6 am rode on a two wheeler for almost 40 kms (approx) for few plates of Idly.. But, trust me it was worth it.. we enjoyed the journey and the food was amazing (Not a mallige idly. But, fantastic idlies) I would have eaten 3 -4 plates there too..So there it is the best food ever eaten..P.S: I am still searching on the Dasara Exhibitions every year to find that perfect mallige idly. So far I have not been successful.. Anyone knows any place in Bangalore or Mysore which serves awesome mallige idly.. Please let me know.. A hungry soul is waiting to be satisfied."
327,"I was born into wealth and never knew our family was different until acclimating to the public school system and developing cognizant thought. My father was recruited by MIT and came to the United States speaking only two languages: Japanese and binary. Upon graduation, he was quickly snatched up by Japanese financial institutions that sent him abroad to set up their computing systems. This was back in the day before IT was segmented, and he was a one man operation (architect, network administrator, systems engineer, programmer, IT support and R&D LOL.)Before moving abroad for good, he married my mother in Tokyo and together they immigrated to Canada. I was born in West Vancouver, British Columbia and attended exclusive private schools. My classmates were of the same socio-economic status as my family, so our lifestyles were similar. Our days were jam packed with lessons, classes, tutors and we were privileged to take weekend trips to Banff or Lake Louise. When I was in the 1st grade, my family migrated south to the U.S. - the San Francisco Bay Area to be exact. Against my mother's wishes, my father made the executive decision to put me in public school. I was still in 1st grade but clearly remember the moments I started realizing the kids at my new school were unlike my old peers. I was the only one dressed in pinafores. The only one taking a load of after school classes and lessons. Other people didn't go away on weekends. My home was different. Everything about my family was strange, and I remember thinking I was not just the new kid, but the weird new kid.In order to fit in, I started lying. I would tell people I lived in San Mateo as opposed to Hillsborough. I stopped inviting people over, never told friends about our weekend trips. Or that I attended summer school at Crystal Springs Uplands, then summer sports camp at Stanford University. Being constantly exposed to two different socio-economic worlds, I didn't fit in anywhere and was an outcast.Separately, gross behavior from people who think they have more than the next person is more commonly observed in new money. My family is proof.My father's family has a prominent lineage that can be traced for centuries; I guess it's called old money. My father was the only one who lived outside of Japan and my brother and I would spend our summer/winter vacations with our grandparents. My day school friends and their families were exactly like my father's side: kind, well mannered, polite, gracious and classy from the inside out. You see, when born into wealth, there is nothing to prove. We are raised to assimilate and not stand out as much as possible. Yes, we do own nice things, but there is no need to flaunt. Growing up in the U.S. and Canada in a household that only spoke Japanese was embarrassing. Public outings with my father could be turned into a sitcom. He spoke broken English even after living in English speaking countries for 20+ years. I used to be mortified in public with him. His voice was loud. His English poor. Yet no matter how atrocious his grammar, pronunciation and vocabulary, he still talked to everyone in a pleasant manner. Everyone. At restaurants he frequented, from the valets, wait staff to busboys and the kitchen, the entire staff knew my father. The chefs would take my brother and me to the kitchen for special menus. (These were 5 star dining rooms.) When we drove through Half Moon Bay, my father would stop by his favorite farms and greet farmers working the fields. They only spoke Spanish and he spoke zero Spanish but somehow they were able to communicate. At his work, from security and maintenance staff to his assistants, colleagues and C-level execs,¬† people would smile and wave hello as he walked by. He took after my grandmother, who treated every single person the same: like they mattered.Conversely, my mother grew up dirt poor. Frankly, she was a gold digger and married my father for stature, status, lifestyle and most importantly his wealth. She epitomized gross new money characteristics where she felt entitled because our family was more privileged than most. She was snooty, elitist and condescending to those she thought were beneath her; absolutely charming to those who were of equal or higher social statuses. Even as a child, I remember apologizing for her vile behavior and was embarrassed to be in public with her. Long story short, even if we had access to things a lot of people didn't, it still wasn't enough for my mother. On the outside, she was polished, elegant, sharp, witty and sustained her youthful looks. But she was a horrible wife, mother and housewife. She was miserable most of her adult life; making everyone around her even more miserable. I'm making her sound like a crappy person, but as an individual she was phenomenal. I - along with many - admired her. She was a born entrepreneur, extremely brilliant, creative but analytical, methodical, strategic and organized. When my parents finally divorced, she left my brother and me with our dad and succeeded career wise. So much so, she retired in her early 40s. After she attained what she thought was success, she was diagnosed with Stage IV cancer. She spent the days up until her death regretting almost all the choices she made and beat herself up day after day. One of her last journal entries included reflections on how unappreciative she was with the things in front of her, and finally realizing happiness does not lie within superficial matters a little too late.Looking back, I am extremely grateful for my parents and my life. Don't get me wrong, my life was far from cakewalk but I obtained invaluable life lessons. My father, taught me my favorite quote: ""A true measure of a man is how he treats someone who can do him no good."" by actions, not words. My mother, taught me money cannot buy happiness. I am so fortunate to comprehend those simple yet complicated life lessons I still abide by. And just by remembering those two points, saved me from making vast mistakes in relationship, career and life choices. So what does it feel like to be rich? It's like everyone's life, no matter what your financial situation is, there are ups and downs. Different ups and downs, but ups and downs nonetheless. Hope this sheds some perspective. Oh. As for my father, the divorce (and my mother) basically destroyed him, and a series of events led to my father being disowned. I have not spoken to him since I was 16... along with other misc. family drama. But that is a story for another day."
328,"Billionaires own government and have outlawed journalism. The only legitimate governing authority imposed on anyone is that performed by governing entities under the strict, 24/7/365, dictatorial [DEMOCRATIC!!!] command of our citizen majority [primarily by/for the local majority]. The moment our citizen majority loses even the slightest portion of instant command over our governing entities we're no longer CITIZENS: we disgracefully surrender to FASCIST RULE and become SUBJECTS. The portion of power the Constitution places under our citizen's majority command is actually nil. Genuine DEMOCRATIC RULE would ordain a constitution that forces government funding of ELECTED citizen groups who'd, in turn, force government's abject obedience and defense of every citizen's rights under The Bill of Rights [especially JOURNALISM= FREE PRESS]. That democratic constitution would force the elected citizen JOURNALISM groups to publish/distribute/broadcast a complete transparent account of all governing. The true function of an actual FREE PRESS [JOURNALISM] is to consistently punish those who passionately seek to rob us of our life as CITIZENS and who'd joyfully profit from forcing us into the disgraceful nightmare of living as powerless SUBJECTS under fascist rule. In other words, it's the job of actual JOURNALISM to heroically punish/restrict capitalism so severely that the poorest of us command governing power exactly equal to that of the richest. The actual purpose of our malicious, fascist, founding fathers had for writing the Constitution of the United States was to destroy/prohibit democracy. Absent democratic funding of a genuine FREE PRESS [JOURNALISM] we'll continue to live as disgraced, powerless subjects enslaved and impoverished by the fascist billionaires who've totally outlawed journalism [excluding the minimal dissemination provided by a few heroes on the net= TYT, Jimmy Dore, Lee Camp, RT, Thom Hartman, Amy Goodman, others]."

331,"Pros:Exceptionally loving, loyal, easy to train, and care about your feelings. I used to leave food on the table and go out for hours: my German Shepherd mix would guard it instead of eating it.Sensitive, sweet, kind and playful. At one point I had a kitten and my dog was completely besotted with him. They would roll around on the floor together for hours. The kitten would pounce on his tail and playfully claw and bite his face, and the shepherd would just snuggle up and lick him.Intelligence. They are rated by Stanley Coren as one of the top ten breeds in terms of working intelligence. From my own experience, I'd describe them as highly trainable rather than smart exactly. Very beautiful and athletic, especially the working lines. Instinctively protective and usually sensible about it. I felt safe walking alone at night with my shepherd mix, even in rough neighborhoods. The only times he showed any aggression to humans were when he sensed that I felt threatened -- in which case he could be extremely intimidating. None of my other dogs have shown such good judgement.Cons: They're somewhat nervous: because they are also loyal and protective, they need substantial socialization to ensure they won't endanger people and animals. This may be a major time sink. Some shepherds will never be trustworthy with small dogs, which means you can never let them off-leash in a public place. I knew a well-bred shepherd owned by very experienced, responsible people, who bit a stranger in her territory severely.They bark about the average amount for a dog, which is too much for many people, so you will have to train them to bark less. They also shed and stink about the average amount.Some people are really scared of them. You may have difficulty getting a lease.They are usually Velcro dogs. They don't want to be alone, and when they're awake, they really want to participate in whatever you're doing. If you have to go out a lot, or you don't want tennis balls dropped in your lap while you're watching TV every night, or you like to shower alone, don't get a shepherd.They are fairly active dogs, both mentally and physically. Just to not be miserable, they need about an hour of exercise every day, toys to chew on, and big open spaces to explore. Young dogs are too big and rough to be around young kids without frequent intervention.They have been through periods of popularity in which unscrupulous breeders produced lines with unreliable temperaments. In addition, some responsible breeders select for much more tough guard dogs, whilst others aim for a softer, more gentle animal. So finding the right breeder will be challenging. They are very prone to a wide range of health problems, more so than similar but less popular breeds. Be prepared to shell out money for hip surgery. For this reason alone, I would choose a first generation cross if possible rather than a purebred shepherd. Or you might consider a Belgian shepherd, which are very similar but have less problems.Most of these cons can't be predicted or controlled for any individual dog. There are ways to deal with them, but they're costly. German shepherds very often end up in shelters because their owners either didn't think through, or found they couldn't deal with these issues when they actually happened. This is heartbreaking for everyone involved, and most of all for the dog. You might consider adopting an older dog since shelters usually screen them carefully and will know which issues are likely to arise."

335,"What happens when you cry, exactly? A salty fluid chock full of protein,water ,mucus and oil is released from the lacrimal gland in the upper, outer region of your eye. This fluid, better known as tears, then flows down the surface of your eye, across your face and smears your mascara.Of course, not all tears are of the emotional variety. In fact, three types of tears exist, all with different purposes. Basal tears are omnipresent in our eyes. These constant tears are what keep our eyes from drying out completely. The human body produces an average of 5 to 10 ounces of basal tears each day. They drain through the nasal cavity, which is the reason so many of us develop runny noses after a good sobfest.The second type is reflex tears, which serve to protect the human eye from harsh irritants such as smoke, onions or even a very strong, dusty wind. To accomplish this feat, the sensory nerves in your cornea communicate this irritation to your brain stem, which in turn sends hormones to the glands in the eyelids. These hormones cause the eyes to produce tears, effectively ridding them of the irritating substance.The third type of tears is emotional tears. It all starts in the cerebrum where sadness is registered. The endocrine system is then triggered to release hormones to the ocular area, which then causes tears to form. Emotional tears are common among people who see Bambi's mother die or who suffer personal losses.The phrase ""having a good cry"" suggests that crying can actually make you feel physically and emotionally better, which many people believe. Some scientists agree with this theory, asserting that chemicals build up in the body during times of elevated stress. These researchers believe that emotional crying is the body's way of ridding itself of these toxins and waste products.In fact, one study collected both reflex tears and emotional tears (after peeling an onion and watching a sad movie, respectively). When scientists analyzed the content of the tears, they found each type was very different. Reflex tears are generally found to be about 98 percent water, whereas several chemicals are commonly present in emotional tears .First is a protein called prolactin, which is also known to control breast milk production. Adrenocorticotropic hormones are also common and indicate high stress levels. The other chemical found in emotional tears is leucine-enkephalin, an endorphin that reduces pain and works to improve mood."

340,"Everyone writes about C++ and Java or even C. The question was what is the best language to start learning NOW in 2014 not 1994.C++ is widely used because it's absolutely general purpose. But writing in it takes time... But seriously, a lot of it. Same for CJava right now is used mostly for android and enterprise software. However the latter slowly moves to other languages. Why? Because Java is horribly redundant and boilerplated. If not android it'd be dying language.Python is good, but it's not so new or innovative. Whilst if You want to learn something from scratch You'd want something that yields great productivity and top technologies.But now what is really good language to start learning.The most useful right now is - unfortunately - JavaScript. Why? Because You can write anything in it. From websites through desktop apps (node-webkit, TideSDK), mobile apps (Cordova PhoneGap) ending on web servers and even realtime app servers (Node.js)It's extremely useful if You want to write little apps that don't require type checking and more advanced structuring.What's next? Ruby. Why? Because it's most popular language on github and stack overflow right now. Community is the most important part of any environment. What's more Ruby has been created with easiness of development and fast iteration in mind. Thanks to that You can ship Your product the fastest.But what if You want to write huge servers that are typesafe and have no performance overhead? Scala. Why? Ask LinkedIn for example. They moved their whole infrastructure into Scala and they say it has been the best move they could make.Although Scala has very steep learning curve it's worth the commitment. Martin Odersky the creator of Scala has been working on Generics system in early Java dev and he claims it's so broken he had to write language from scratch. What's more Scala uses Functional paradigm which is becoming widely popular because Amdahl's law started to matter much more than Moore's law in today's CPU architecture.PS. Even Quora uses ScalaIf You want to learn language that is popular now. OK pick C++ or Java. But if You want to learn something that will give You advantage over people with 20 year inertia. Pick one of the above/Edit other language that is worth taking look at is Go but I don't know much about it so I won't take a voice./Edit2 For iOS dev Swift is the one too/Edit3 For scalable distributed systems with nine nines of availability there's also Elixir. It's pretty new (3 years now) but it's really worth looking at. It's a maturity of Erlang with productivity of Ruby. Cool stuff/Edit4 Rust language seems to grow as a potential C++ competitor.

341,"Earthquake Resistant Design Philosophy:The engineers do not attempt to make earthquake-proof buildings that will not get damaged even during the rare but strong earthquake; such buildings will be too robust and also too expensive. Instead, the engineering intention is to make buildings earthquake-resistant; such buildings resist the effects of ground shaking, although they may get damaged severely but would not collapse during the strong earthquake. Thus, safety of people and contents is assured in earthquake-resistant buildings, and thereby a disaster is avoided. This is a major objective of seismic design codes throughout the world.¬†Building Twist During Earthquake:A building with identical vertical members and that are uniformly placed in the two horizontal directions, when shaken at its base in a certain direction, swings back and forth such that all points on the floor move horizontally by the same amount in the direction in which it is shaken.But in most cases are buildings are not symmetrical, Hence there will be unequal amount of swing and shake. This will cause what is known as Twist or Torsion. This unequal movement will cause more damage to columns, which move more during the shake.This twist or torsion due to unequal distribution will cause maximum failure of buildings. Design :Buildings should be designed like the ductile chain. For example, consider the common urban residential apartment construction - the multi-storey building made of reinforced concrete. It consists of horizontal and vertical members, namely beams and columns. The seismic inertia forces generated at its floor levels are transferred through the various beams and columns to the ground. The correct building components need to be made ductile. The failure of a column can affect the stability of the whole building, but the failure of a beam causes localized effect. Therefore, it is better to make beams to be the ductile weak links than columns. This method of designing RC buildings is called the strong-column weak-beam design method (Figure 4). This will make the buildings better resistant to twist. Brick Masonry Structures :In case of brick masonry , the walls lying perpendicular to the direction of ground shake will fail first. Their joints will give away and the walls collapse. Hence it is important that we eliminate this kind of seismic behavior of buildings.  This can be achieved by (a) ensuring good interlocking of the masonry courses at the junctions, and (b) employing horizontal bands at various levels, particularly at the lintel level.Framed Structures : For a building to remain safe during earthquake shaking, columns (which receive forces from beams) should be stronger than beams, and foundations which receive forces from columns) should be stronger than columns. Further, connections between beams & columns and columns & foundations should not fail so that beams can safely transfer forces to columns and columns to foundations.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† When the strategy of Strong Column and Weak Beam is adopted in design, damage is likely to occur first in beams . When beams are detailed properly to have large ductility, the building as a whole can deform by large amounts despite progressive damage caused due to consequent yielding of beams. In contrast, if columns are made weaker, they suffer severe local damage, at the top and bottom of a particular storey. This localized damage can lead to collapse of a building, although columns at storeys above remain almost undamaged. ¬†The Beam Column Joints can be strengthened using more stirrups towards the joint. How to Reduce the effect on Buildings :Conventional seismic design attempts to make buildings that do not collapse under strong earthquake shaking, but may sustain damage to non-structural elements (like glass facades) and to some structural members in the building.

342,"Yes, she is a terrible actress -just because she has an Oscar doesn‚Äôt make her a good one, since it‚Äôs more of a popularity contest nowadays anyways.Here is my opinion regarding her from another Question:Jennifer Lawrence takes overrated to a whole new level -in fact I don‚Äôt think she should be rated to begin with.She fails to impress in both acting ability as well as in looks not to mention her rude, quite trashy and completely unladylike attitude.Yet Hollywood -like so many sweethearts before her, ex. Julia Roberts- keeps shoving her up people‚Äôs throats in a way that makes the word overrated an understatement.They hail her as a great actress and shower her with awards -which ultimately means nothing since people like Gary Oldman has none and people are getting them for economic and political reason now as well as to raise the ratings of these shows- when her acting varies from terrible -mostly- to average at best.They hails her as a real woman when she‚Äôs nothing but a girl and as a breath of fresh air because she‚Äôs rude and has no manners in anyway what so ever -because that should be celebrated of course!She‚Äôs also advertised as curvy and someone who eats what she wants and doesn‚Äôt exercise when she has no waist definition and is a ruler type of body not mention her body is obviously athletic. Not that this makes anyone less of a woman but either don‚Äôt talk about it or say it like it is but don‚Äôt say something is so not true that it‚Äôs ridiculous.She‚Äôs hailed as a beauty when she is way below average in her untouched photos and only barely pretty -but looking like a CGI freak- when retouched.She‚Äôs against using sex to sell, when she‚Äôs the person most to do this -almost all of her photo shoots and magazine covers are overly sexual as well as her red carpets and interviews- except she does it in a self deprecating way so that makes it better.Apart from anything what made her famous is the worst of them all because it was her -either real or crafted- personality which is truly terrible. She epitomizes what‚Äôs wrong with society -trashy, vulgar, rude and sometimes cruel, lacks any class and mannerism and comes off as simply retarded from saying we should ban the word fat which is a simple adjective to being against Hollywood which she earns her living at as well as rejecting using sex to sell as she said regarding Miley Cyrus then doing the same she‚Äôs doing, not to mention thinking OCD is cool. She‚Äôs truly a terrible human being and the world is doomed if people admire the likes of this classless woman."
343,"Let's discuss something before coming back to the actual question.The kind of movies shown in India are so rubbish and far from reality, they do not show the true meaning of life. But since youth are attracted to movies, they don't understand a very simple and basic thing, that what is shown on the screen does not necessarily happen in real life.A disgusting fact is that movies in India only focus on one part of life, that is Love, Flirting and Sex. Beating down goons to save your girlfriend, fighting for your love, flirting with girls (and thinking that they actually like it) and all the stupid and false sense of superiority is all central to the show, which in reality does not exist.You may find this amusing, but guys of today are so hard at work, constantly trying to become one of their popular 'super-heroes', while girls are busy becoming the 'super-heroines'. If the same amount of time and energy they would have spent on education, learning new things & on the various issues India is facing today, India would already have become a developed nation - a technological, cultural, and a world superpower. The funny fact is that each guy thinks that he is a 'hero'; while each girl thinks that she is the only 'heroine'; A common mentality within guys is that doing 'gundagardi' is actually heroic, while girls think that showing 'ego' and wearing short sexy clothes will make them popular.¬† In fact, all this is far, far from reality.¬† Yet still, you will find millions of idiots & fools all over India doing the same thing everyday. Youth is such an important phase of a person's life. The ability to think and act is at its peak when you are a youth. To grow in a healthy way, what India needs are not those stupid 'heroes', but the youth power who can contribute at the different levels of society - scientific, technological, medical, defence, poverty, economy, growth and overall development. The most f*cked up guys in my view are the people who make such films. They have found the magic recipe to make money - keep making those love-themed movies, and the audience will keep pouring in. But now since this pond called Bollywood is full of so many fishes called film-makers, they know the competition is fierce and the audience will only see those films which are more appealing. Hence they must keep raising the bar by making even shorter clothes, even longer kisses, more intense scenes, more revealing bodies, and do everything they can do to keep the audience glued to the screens.What they fail to realize that they have so much responsibility and power in their hands. So so bad, they don't realize they have the power to directly address such a wide audience, and that too YOUTHS! If focused and projected in the right direction, they can make a REVOLUTION! Movies can be made on such a varied topics like technology, science, space exploration, something revolutionary or eye-opening, and beautiful ways to see and live life. But sadly, in reality, that's not true. Still I believe, there will come a time, a saturation point, when all this stupidity will have to END, maybe on a bad note. I just wish I could alert the makers and the viewers before that ugly time comes. I know I have deviated a lot out of the actual question, but what I told you above is the actual 'History' and 'Science' behind it.Coming back to the point, yes, guys of today are getting increasingly frustrated and desperate, and the whole problem I explained above is the reason to blame. Everybody expects a relationship, and most of them simply find it hard to accept and think that girls can actually be friends. Its like their minds have been severely f*cked up over time so that they can't think straight anymore, or that they think that this is what is normal. The same holds true for the opposite sex.I feel so shameful to think how corrupted our minds have become. The minds of youths, the raw brainpower, which can be used to solve so many difficult, unsolved mysteries of mankind and the universe, is being wasted thinking & believing in stupid love stories which simply don't matter! I feel bad how our minds are manipulated daily, and how we so easily accept all the 'rubbish' to be 'real'. I feel sorry for all the Indians who are trapped in this vicious cycle. You are all doomed to fail, very, very hard.P.S.: I too am an Indian guy in my early twenties. I see all of this everyday, many times I too have to suffer its consequences. It has become so common and increasingly normal, that friends think that YOU are stupid if you don't do it all like they do. Its like everybody wants to be the same, but no one decides that it's TIME TO CHANGE. But I have firmly decided that I won't let myself in this trap. It's just like any addiction, that makes you crave for it, but you have to be firm and rock solid on your values, principles and beliefs so that none of it could shake you, and I try my best to stay firm on my belief. I strongly hope my fellow Indians too will understand this over time. Thanks.:)"
344,"Dating a cougar/sugar daddy is great - till it isn't. In my humble opinion, it all comes down to personality, some people have daddy/mommy issues and enjoy the controlling nature of such relationships so they prefer them. There's a huge ego trip with such relationships though and they will end dismally the moment one party starts feeling like the relationship is damaging their ego. In the case of a sugar daddy relationship - he feels more assured as a provider and socially people see him as rich/powerful provided the girl looks the part. She loves it because he's someone who's established and she can be provided for adequately - this doesn't have to be monetary - some women prefer the emotional maturity and stability sugar daddies provide more than they do the cash. Either way though - they both get an ego boost. With the cougar relationships - the cougar feels attractive, ""alive again ""and most importantly, in control of her sexuality and relationship destiny. The younger man feels the ego boost of ""having an older experienced woman"", the diminished financial pressures are great, also the fact that the cougar doesn't actively show her insecurities makes him feel more in control also (suddenly he isn't the insensitive guy messing things up).In my experience though - these relationships usually have a time limit. At some point someone is going to stop enjoying the setup. The older man feels disrespected, younger girl feels too tied down, the older woman feels less beautiful, the younger man feels too controlled, some's dad gets involved, terminal illness becomes too much to bear, family members object, etc, etc. When any of these ego shocks happen, the setup goes up in big bright flames and all parties feel bad and often contemplate not repeating such behavior again - For the ones who do stick it out - trust funds and massive inheritances await. Hang in there ;)¬†¬† "

With the time constraint, made easy notes will do the purpose.Read them and filter out all the formulas and numerical values in a separate notebook (preferably buy 400 pages notebook for it). Your subject will be reduced to 15‚Äì20 pages per subject.Simultaneously solve Previous year questions book of GATE by made easy ( as it is mostly error free).The above exercise will take around 3 months. I have done it within 3 months hence I know it is doable.Plan things in advance, like weekly plans etc so that you don‚Äôt lose the track in between.Dedicate last one month for test series (most important). Give at least 15 full syllabus tests by giving each test on every alternate day. Write mistakes of tests on that 400 page notebook only.This 400 page notebook will be the summary of your whole engineering. Revise it fully in 1‚Äì2 days and take the test. Repeat the cycle fully in last month.After 10 tests as such (20 days passed), There will be two options, either you take 5 more tests if your scores were improved with past 10 tests, or revise the notes in last 10 days so that you can tie all the loose ends. Choose any option depending on your style.Take GATE with calm mind, don‚Äôt mess up things on the D-Day.By following above it is really impossible that you score below 40 marks. Your marks will be more than that, and if luck favours you, you will land at the IITs.My one friend did exactly this and got AIR 452 in GATE 2015 and is sitting at IIT Delhi.Thanks."

347,"I started my business with Rs.100I had read so many answer on Quora that suggest one to start your own YouTube channel, Write blogs, Affiliate Marketing etc.I think that requires a lot of Patience. That business requires at least internet, camera laptops/PC , requires qualified candidate.And you may end up with losses.In my case you can start your business with only Rs.100.When I was in college I was able to pay my college fee from my business, my college fee was 1 lakh per year.I started my business 4 year agoWhen I was student I had seen many students looking for accommodation .I thought I can make money from it.I decided that time I will.I went to down town roamed around, I found one family they are looking for paying guestI started discussion with family I had collected all information regarding fees,water supply electric supply, advance amount.On next day I woke up early morning taken my laptop and started designing advertisement of that roomIn that advertisement, I had mentioned all facilities, fees and location of room.I went to Xerox shop to take printout.I pinned that printout advertisement on college notice board and mentioned my number.Within two days I received 50‚Äì60 calls.I made a list of all buyers.(approx.55)I told them about that room and my fees 500 per person.I also told the landlord about my fees - 500 per person.I showed that room to 4 guys, and one of them was ready to move into that room.So I made my 1st deal on that day.So now I have Rs.1000 in my pocket and have 54 tenant contacts, so thought this is a potential goldmine.I appointed a local boy who was not very literate and didn't belong to my college.I told him to search for rental house in city and to give me details and contacts and I would give him Rs.50 rupees per house.This time I was left with 40 potential buyers.I successfully made all 40 deals.I got 40√ó1000=40,000(+)Local boy reward 40√ó50=2,000(-)My initial investment was = 500(-)So I made total = 37,500This all happened in one month.Now I appointed two local boysOne to post advertisements in crowded areasAnd one for finding out the rooms.So I made around 12 lakhs in my academic years excluding local boys payout and investment.Now this time I bought a car of 5lakh and attached it to company for transportation.I charge around 15,000/- per month.So my monthly income is 15000+35,000= 50,000.(including local boy payout , investment, car maintenance)Annual income is 6lakh rupees without jobNow I am working with MNC as engineer my salary is 8 lakhs per annumSo my total annual income is 14 lakh per year.My work load is to handle local boys and to maintain the car.My Future plan is to open security agency services, man power supply, school buses etc. Soon I will make income beyond 25 lakhs per annum.

348,"I was 4 almost 5. My experience was not near death, it was death.I was in my bed sick. I had been very ill running fevers hitting 104. Mom says I hit 105 at some point. I remember being lowered into a cold tub of water, my mother frantically trying to bring the fever down. I would hallucinate the same thing when my fever got that high. The ceiling would start bouncing back and forth like a rubber band. It would begin lowering down on me. I would cry out thinking I was going to be crushed. In looking back now it was probably seizures.I was also vomiting every hour or less. When my stomach had nothing left I was dry heaving yellow mucus.Mom took me to the hospital seeing I was getting ready to die. I was little and my body had taken all it could. I was losing against whatever bug had hold of me.I was immediately rushed back to the ER beds and the room became busy with medical staff rushing around. They were asking mom questions as she watched me looking worried and trying not to cry.I felt so tired. I just wanted to sleep for a while. I remember telling everyone I was feeling much better. The sounds in the room started to get a hollow echo to them. I just wanted to close my eyes, so I did.The voices in the room continued to echo. I suddenly noticed my toes were touching the foot of the bed. I thought,‚Äùwow! I am a big girl!‚Äù I felt so proud. I opened my eyes to look and when I did I was looking at myself. I was laying on a gurney. I was blue. My eyes were slats. There were people around me frantically working. Mom was crying as she looked on.I wasn't upset or scared. A little confused. I knew I didn't have a body. I felt like I was part of everything and everyone. I just floated up and could see other rooms. I later detailed conversations that there is no way I could have known. I lifted out of the hospital and continued ascending. I began browsing thru time. I saw events from my short life. I later detailed things that occured before I could even talk. Things I should not be able to remember but do and in great detail. Ascended more. I felt at peace. There were no questions or unknowns. There were no fears or worries. I began drifting towards a light. It was beautiful. I wanted to touch it.Suddenly there was a pop. It felt like I was attached to a cord and someone grabbed it and jerked me down. I descended almost instantly.After that it's hazy. I obviously got better and went home. The experience has shaped me in so many ways. I know there is a place we go when we die. Oddly I still fear death. I can't understand why.So that's my near death experience. I hope it gives some one hope ."
349,"Thanks for the ask to answer.For me it depends entirely on where you live and what activities your dog participates in as well.Spot on applications consist of a liquid that you place on the skin on the back of the neck. These as great as they are easy to do and are given monthly. However,if you wash your dog frequently or your dog goes swimming these applications will wear off faster. If you have children there is always the risk they will be exposed to the liquid.Oral tablets such as comfortis (name of product in Australia) are great as it not only kills fleas on your dog within 30 minutes of ingestion but it also prevents fleas from being able to live on your dog. There is almost no risk that children will have access to it unless your dog spits it out or vomits the tablet back up."
350,"J was originally distinguished from the letter I at some point during the mid-1500s by a Frenchman named Pierre Ramus. The J character had existed for a while before, but was used for other purposes, not in english. The letter J originally made the ""y"" sound, but at around the same time that the letter J was introduced, many of the Western European languages made a sound shift, and began pronouncing the vowel ""y"" like the consonant¬† ""d í"" or what we now commonly use the letter J for. The older vowel use is still seen in a few European languages, German and Norwegian for example."
351,"Shop for (up to) four weeks, not one.It's hard to tell much about a class from the first week alone --- you typically only get two lectures to try out, and the first one is often an overview that doesn't give you a good sense of how the rest of the course will actually be run.¬† But the add/drop deadline is the fifth Monday of the semester (with $10 fee, or third Monday with no fee).If you're still deciding between two classes on study card day, put both on your study card.¬† Try out the first few weeks of both courses, then whenever you're confident you know which course you prefer, drop the extra class.There are many advantages to this approach:¬† You get to try out the first few problem sets (if your course has them), see how your professor lectures when it isn't shopping week, and meet the TF and other students in your section, not to mention having a better sense of whether you enjoy the material in the course and whether the level of difficulty will be appropriate for you.Sometimes even the first 3-5 weeks of a course aren't representative (CS 121, for which I was a teaching fellow, picks up quite a bit after the fifth Monday), so it's worth asking your professors what to expect.¬† The other main drawback is that you have to some extra work for a course you end up dropping, but the beginning of the semester isn't usually so busy anyway, and I've found I've chosen courses more wisely with 3 weeks of information rather than 1."

355,"The Humanitarian sector is quite competitive (which areas are not?) and getting 'in' might not be a straight route. You essentially have two options: 1) volunteer and 2) employed. The 2nd option is preferable but is made easier by having carried out the 1st route. If you're interested in applying your medical training/education then a few organisations pop up: Red Cross and MSF to name two. Both are very active in offering medical aid and expertise in response to disasters, complex emergencies as well as longer-term development work. However, am unsure what their entry requirements are. Certainly, I doubt they will just take anyone. Experience (in the right areas and conditions) is probably pre-requisite. Like I said, the competition is probably quite high. Volunteering as your first step is probably easier: try local areas/charities/church groups/hospitals. You need to show willing to get the work done and build your career up from the ground up. Considering local organisations shows willing and is probably easier to achieve: don't think you can just land in the middle of a MSF medical unit in Syria for example. Start early, start small but keep an eye on where you want to beGood luck!"

358,"The average number of hashes performed per block in Bitcoin is controlled by the difficulty. Every two weeks, nodes in the network determine how fast blocks have been produced in the near past, and correct the difficulty required for future blocks accordingly.If all miners would agree to stop using their clusters with custom-designed chips, the difficulty would indeed drop. In theory, it can drop low enough that a single Raspberry Pi could indeed produce all blocks. Of course, it would be impossible to enforce, as mining - by design - can be done anonymously. Literally anyone in the network could decide to join with say a decent desktop computer, and claim most of the blocks.If you're talking about whether a Raspberry Pi could compete with the existing mining hardware? No, not in a trillion years. Literally. Redoing the amount of hash computation that the whole Bitcoin ecosystem has performed together in the past 49 days (june 8th - july 26, 2016) would take a Raspberry Pi 1 (I don't have numbers for 2 and 3) a trillion years (which is 72 times the age of the universe)."
359,"I was born into a racist society (North Carolina in the 1940‚Äôs and 50‚Äôs). My parents were racists. My Dad believed negroes were a lesser species. I attended segregated schools. I heard that song in Sunday School that Jesus loves the little children: ‚ÄúRed and yellow black and white, they are precious in his sight.‚Äù I suspected this racism thing might not be what Jesus had in mind. As I progressed through high school I had more contact with more liberal sentiments. It was the 60‚Äôs and the Civil Rights movement was in flower. I went off to college in 1964. I was in the first class in my school with black students - two of them.At this point I believed black people were my equal. I believed it in my head but not in my heart. I could not talk to a black person without being patronizing. Touching a black person felt like an electric shock. I could not perceive a black woman as beautiful. I knew how I ought to behave, but I could not be authentic about it. People pick up on this stuff.After college I went to seminary. An important part of the training of a minister is practical work in a parish. This is called field work. One of my field jobs was at Grace-Hope Presbyterian Church in Louisville Kentucky. This congregation was 100% black. I started in June. I did not see a white person for three months. At the end of this period my perceptions had changed. I could shake hands with black people without feeling a shock. I had black friends. I started seeing black women as beautiful. When I watched TV I began to identify personal care products that were for whites only. My heart had changed. And people could tell it.I have a number of black friends and a black son-in-law. I have attached a picture of my grandson, who makes me as proud as I can be.Now and then I ask my black friends if they pick up any racist vibe from me. They've always told me no. I have come to believe there is one human race. We are all one color: some shade of brown. And I am certain that Jesus loves all the little children."

361,"Well you see sir, I've been living in this country my whole life. You see, its a pretty, northern (sometimes chilly) country. We call it Canada. We call ourselves Canucks. The name come from the iroquois word ""Kanata"" which means up river. The explorer John Cartier understood it as ""Kanada"" and thought that was the name of the land which he was claiming. (Aboriginals treated land rights very differently than Europeans, and so the naming is not referring to a strict boundary around a plot of land, but just the general area up the river) Canada was a better way to spell it in English, and that went on the maps he brought back. I'm not sure how legitimate the story actually is, that's just what my history teacher taught me.A little information on my experiances around the world. I've left the country for a few exciting excursions and usually when I tell people I'm from Canada, they say ""oh wow! My cousin lives in Canada! Do you know them? Their name is John smith."" Or they say ""really? I thought you where American."" And I then have to explain nicely that I'm not from that but southern country, I'm from Canada.

364,"1. Don't study grammar too muchThis rule might sound strange to many ESL students, but it is one of the most important rules. If you want to pass examinations, then study grammar. However, if you want to become fluent in English, then you should try to learn English without studying the grammar. Studying grammar will only slow you down and confuse you. You will think about the rules when creating sentences instead of naturally saying a sentence like a native. Remember that only a small fraction of English speakers know more than 20% of all the grammar rules. Many ESL students know more grammar than native speakers.2. Learn and study phrasesMany students learn vocabulary and try to put many words together to create a proper sentence. It amazes me how many words some of my students know, but they cannot create a proper sentence. The reason is because they didn't study phrases. When children learn a language, they learn both words and phrases together. Likewise, you need to study and learn phrases. If you know 1000 words, you might not be able to say one correct sentence. But if you know 1 phrase, you can make hundreds of correct sentences. If you know 100 phrases, you will be surprised at how many correct sentences you will be able to say. Finally, when you know only a 1000 phrases, you will be almost a fluent English speaker. Don't translate When you want to create an English sentence, do not translate the words from your Mother tongue. The order of words is probably completely different and you will be both slow and incorrect by doing this. Instead, learn phrases and sentences so you don't have to think about the words you are saying. It should be automatic. Another problem with translating is that you will be trying to incorporate grammar rules that you have learned. Translating and thinking about the grammar to create English sentences is incorrect and should be avoided. 3. Reading and Listening is NOT enough. Practice Speaking what you hear!Reading, listening, and speaking are the most important aspects of any language. The same is true for English. However, speaking is the only requirement to be fluent. It is normal for babies and children to learn speaking first, become fluent, then start reading, then writing. So the natural order is listening, speaking, reading, then writing. First ProblemIsn't it strange that schools across the world teach reading first, then writing, then listening, and finally speaking? Although it is different, the main reason is because when you learn a second language, you need to read material to understand and learn it. So even though the natural order is listening, speaking, reading, then writing, the order for ESL students is reading, listening, speaking, then writing. Second ProblemThe reason many people can read and listen is because that's all they practice. But in order to speak English fluently, you need to practice speaking. Don't stop at the listening portion, and when you study, don't just listen. Speak out loud the material you are listening to and practice what you hear. Practice speaking out loud until your mouth and brain can do it without any effort. By doing so, you will be able to speak English fluently. 4. Submerge yourselfBeing able to speak a language is not related to how smart you are. Anyone can learn how to speak any language. This is a proven fact by everyone in the world. Everyone can speak at least one language. Whether you are intelligent, or lacking some brain power, you are able to speak one language. This was achieved by being around that language at all times. In your country, you hear and speak your language constantly. You will notice that many people who are good English speakers are the ones who studied in an English speaking school. They can speak English not because they went to an English speaking school, but because they had an environment where they can be around English speaking people constantly. There are also some people who study abroad and learn very little. That is because they went to an English speaking school, but found friends from their own country and didn't practice English. You don't have to go anywhere to become a fluent English speaker. You only need to surround yourself with English. You can do this by making rules with your existing friends that you will only speak English. You can also carry around an iPod and constantly listen to English sentences. As you can see, you can achieve results by changing what your surroundings are. Submerge yourself in English and you will learn several times faster. ¬†5. Study correct materialA common phrase that is incorrect is, ""Practice makes perfect."" This is far from the truth. Practice only makes what you are practicing permanent. If you practice the incorrect sentence, you will have perfected saying the sentence incorrectly. Therefore, it is important that you study material that is commonly used by most people. Another problem I see is that many students study the news. However, the language they speak is more formal and the content they use is more political and not used in regular life. It is important to understand what they are saying, but this is more of an advanced lesson that should be studied after learning the fundamental basics of English. Studying English with a friend who is not a native English speaker is both good and bad. You should be aware of the pros and cons of speaking with a non native speaking friend. Practicing with a non native person will give you practice. You can also motivate each other and point out basic mistakes. But you might pick up bad habits from one another if you are not sure about what are correct and incorrect sentences. So use these practice times as a time period to practice the correct material you studied. Not to learn how to say a sentence. In short, study English material that you can trust, that is commonly used, and that is correct."

368,"Bermuda Triangle is the greatest unsolved mystery of the modern age. Also called Devil's Triangle. It is a triangular shaped area in the North Atlantic Ocean, from Bermuda Island to Miami, USA and Puerto Rico. Hundreds of people and numerous boats, ships and planes have disappeared inside this triangle. Reasons given for these disappearances vary from scientific to sheer myth. Here are 10 facts about Bermuda Triangle :Fact No. 1The Bermuda Triangle is not small. In fact, it is quite large and covers an area of 440,000 miles of sea. This is larger than the combined area of Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh & Maharashtra.Fact No. 2The bermuda triangle is certainly not fixed and its effect can be experienced outside of the triangle too.Fact No. 3The disappearances are ascribed to UFO's and alien activity, city of Atlantis lost under the triangle, and various other technical, natural and geographical reasons.Fact No. 4Whenever any plane or ship disappears in the Triangle, its debris cannot be found. The reason behind this is that Gulf Stream runs near the triangle, which quickly gets rid of the debris.Fact No. 5At least 1000 lives are lost within the last 100 years. On average, 4 aircraft and 20 yachts go missing every year.Fact No. 6Inside the Bermuda Triangle, US Government has AUTEC (for Atlantic Undersea Test and Evaluation Center), which is located on the Andros Island of Bahamas. Here US Navy tests their submarines, sonar and other weapons. However many are of the view that it is more than just the testing center.Fact No. 7People have experienced electronic fog in bermuda triangle, which can be a Time Travel Tunnel too. Pilot Bruce Gernon claims he lost 28 minutes after flying through a time-warping cloud tunnel. The plane went missing from radars, only to re-emerge in Miami Beach. (Source: The Fog by Bruce Gernon.)Fact No. 8One of the biggest and famous losses of US Military occurred in 1945. Five US Navy Avenger torpedo bombers flew from Fort Lauderdale, Florida for a sortie to the island of Bimini. The mission had 14 men. After about 90 minutes, the radio operators received a signal that the compass was not working. After that the communication was lost. The bombers were never found. The three planes that went for their rescue also disappeared.Fact No. 9The first person to report about Bermuda Triangle was Christopher Columbus. He wrote in his journals that inside the triangle, the ship's compass stopped working and he also saw a fireball in the sky.Fact No. 10Bermuda Triangle is one of the rare places on earth where the compass does not point towards Magnetic North. Instead of that, it point towards true north, which creates confusion and that's why so many ships and planes lost its course in the triangle"

370,"I am currently on a job site and will be here for 4 months. I am living in a RV trailer that would make a great tiny home except a few things:1. the RV insulation sucks, it was very cold in Iowa in March and it is getting hot now (the AC is noisy and needs repair)2. the general quality ""looks"" good but is cheap. Cheap faucets, cheap shower, cheap furniture, cheap furnace, cheap everything3. the RV plumbing is a challenge, especially since we need to request black water dumping and our gages are only so accurate4. this unit is a few years old. Some components look good, but other are worn out / damaged requiring specialized parts - like the broken door latch that makes airing out the house challenging on windy days - which are common. The operable windws and roof vents are a challenge of their own.5. The kitchen is small. It's ok for a casual meal but not for a standard multi-course production6. The furniture is compact and designed to change into small beds. The dining room table is cramped and the sofa is barely comfortable. If comfort is important cheap furniture will influence your lifestyle. You live the compromise.There are many other compromises but to answer your question:With just me the ""home"" is acceptable. However - when my wife visits it's a challenge. She can stand the trailer for about 6 days, then back to home she goes.We have been married for 35 years so we have learned to live with each other like and old loving couple, because we are. We both engage with each other, and joke around, as well as live ""around"" each other. There are times we are intimately together and other times we need to be space separated, i.e. when one is reading and the other is watching a movie or engaging in other interests.As an example I need a few minutes of quiet time to finish up work correspondence and set the stage for the next day. So our ""chalet"" is a ok for 1 person (me), but a challenge for even a seasoned couple full time - unless you have more then one living space. Or used the TH as a crash pad and spend most of your time away. (In Mason City Iowa?)This unit has about 50 cubic feet of storage in cabinets and cupboards. That does not include the 7' long bedroom closet, which may add another 50 cubic feet of easily accessible storage. That is sufficient for me. But most tiny homes have far less. (I will use some of the RV storage ideas in the tiny home I'm building)The RV has sliders. They greatly increase the inside usable space. We don't feel cramped.I work on construction projects being gone 4-18 months at a time. The tiny house I am building will minimize the above problems and issues - but NO I could not live in a tiny home ""full time"".In the TH I will save $$$ and I can design around our needs: increased insulation, higher quality, better windows, two living spaces, bigger kitchen, ample storage, sliders, regular plumbing with maceration unit (etc.). But eventually I need to return to my house. That is our home.in my TH world I need to accept my wife's ""visiting"" me....With a customized design her TH limits may extend - time wise - maybe to a few weeks.But she has learned from the experience. It is a lot better then her original decree ""I will NEVER live in a tiny home"". But to tell the truth living in a hotel room, renting a room (i.e Airbnb) or renting an apartment are even less appealing - even for the the duration of my short projects. Moving a TH close to the work site has many advantages.So my limit for TH living would a few months, maybe 6-8. Just right for a small project.I am currently on my 3rd month in this rental RV. It is still enjoyable at this point. When I was younger and single my limits might be a little longer. Maybe a few years, provided I was single and planning to stay single. But once dating lead to a relationship the tiny home surely would have joined the discussion. (I guess my interest of tiny homes does not extend to the point that they control my life - too much)We would not have started our family in one (we have 4 kids). But that is my Family and you asked it I would live in a TH. So call me a part timer. And note this is my ""second"" home, a short stay accomodation, where our ""main"" home is just 6 hours away.So if you are considering full time TH living you may try the RV challenge first. You will learn a lot... if you live near Mason City Iowa, come visit.Edited for typos. Sorry"
371,"She's 14. Fourteen.Too young.If you ask her out - she might say yes. But it's very unlikely she understands what relationships entail at this point. No matter how exceptional and mature and amazing she may appear to you - she's none of those things. She's a child who won't be set in her way until many, many years. She is not ready for this.If you are already friends with her - guide her through these difficult, awkward years, and be a positive influence. If, years later, when you are both adults, things take a romantic turn, go ahead. But for now, make sure all your interactions are strictly platonic and have no ulterior motive.If, however, she's a distant crush - this is not love. It's infatuation at best. Do not let yourself believe that you love someone you do not actually know, and maintain your distance. She's young and doesn't know how to handle romantic interest - it's in the best interest of both of you to stay away. You are on the cusp of adulthood - invest your time in people your own age, and you'll have far more satisfying relationships."
372,"Ravens are omnivores, but prefer meat. I hope you are not squeamish because the best things to feed him are, in order, baby mice or pieces of baby chick, water-soaked high protein dog food, scrambled eggs, and fresh fruits and vegetables. Half of his food should be baby mice or baby chick; you can vary this with chicken hearts and livers, other raw meat scraps, or turkey parts, but not too often, because our commercially raised animals are full of hormones and antibiotics and would not replicate his natural diet. If you can handle picking up fresh roadkill and cutting it up for him to tear into, that would be ideal. He should be given all of the roadkill, guts included. If you can‚Äôt deal with this, you should give him chicken wings or turkey necks to allow him the natural behavior of tearing the meat off the bone. Allow him to eat as much as he wants; ravens won‚Äôt overeat. As he gets older you can graduate him to bigger mice until he is eating fully adult mice.You can vary his diet with rabbits, frogs, crayfish, snakes, lizards, salamanders, rats, grasshoppers, cutworms and mealworms.If you keep your raven healthy, he could live to be 40 years old."
373,"I will share my experience, strength, and hope around my own experience with depression.Depression can NOT be taken away quickly or easily. Sadness is possible to get past quickly, but not depression. Depression is a dark pit of nothingness, filled with aches and pains and regret and guilt.Recovery from depression has to be done across many fronts at once. These are some tools that you can choose to use. I‚Äôve done all these things, but not all in one day. Some of these have been more helpful than others.A chemical imbalance in the brain may warrant prescription medicine. Talk to a psychiatrist or medical doctor.Participate in talk therapy either individually or in a group, or both. I‚Äôve had success with CBT and DBT (Cognitive Behavior Therapy and Dialectal Behavior Therapy respectively) to help me find better strategies of coping.Getting active, at least walking for 3 miles a day.Saying affirmations. Affirmations should be stated in the positive present tense towards the thing you want. ‚ÄúI am pleasant in all my interactions today‚Äù is better than ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to be a jerk today‚Äù. Make the statement a stretch, but a believable stretch. If you hate your body your affirmation may start out as ‚ÄúI have a body‚Äù which is towards your goal of loving your body, but it‚Äôs a stretch from ‚ÄúI hate my body‚Äù.Writing in a journal especially around gratitude. ‚ÄúThoughts disentangle themselves as they pass through our fingertips.‚Äù ~ Dawson TrotmanGetting outside in the sun or if not possible a vitamin D supplement.Hugging and saying I love you to those closest to you.Having a sleep regimen: same time to bed, same time to wake up, min 7 hours max 9.Doing productive things. This could be as simple as washing the dishes in the kitchen sink to as complex as a major house project. I would suggest starting out small.Reading uplifting literature or scripture.Meditation, especially mindfulness meditation.Prayer.Take supplements: fish oil, flaxseed oil, magnesium, b complex, vitamin d, multivitamin.Light therapyDrink enough water. How much to drink? Take your body weight in pounds, divide that number in half, the resulting number is how many fluid ounces of water you should be drinking.Going to a support group meeting, whether it is therapy, 12 step, or other.Power poses. See TED talk with Amy Cuddy.Talking to another depressed person for mutual support.Binaural beats meditation music listened to with stereo headphones.Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation.Tapping / EFT.Once you've done all that then watching up to an hour of comedy of your choice, more than that and I'm avoiding life.I personally do not take other alternative supplements such as St John‚Äôs Wort (one of many examples), because I‚Äôm currently on several antidepressants and I could get myself into a worse situation.Depression is REAL. There is no simple fix. Accept that fact. Depression can be managed however. I have had significant relief from depression but I wouldn't say it's gone. It's in the same room as me, but not in my face. I don't listen to it anymore. The monkey is off my back, but the circus is still in town.There is hope, there is healing. Sadly, there is no quick fix. Good luck.Edit 1/19/2019 - Thanks so much for all of the upvotes. I‚Äôve written a post on my blog that lists over 100 options available to treat depression. Many are evidence based proven techniques and some of them fall under the umbrella of quackery, but I strived to be thorough in putting together the list. I‚Äôm not recommending or suggesting you take any of the options as the post is meant to be informational. If you‚Äôd like to read the list please go to: Over 100 different depression treatments."

375,"""[if everyone has a preference] Then everyone is missing half the world's pleasure. The gods made that [women], and it delights me. The gods made this [men]... and it delights me. When it comes to war I fight for Dorne, when it comes to love ‚Äî I don't choose sides.""This is a quote from Game of Thrones, and the philosophy is a compelling one. If one has a desire, but does not act upon it, they are denying themselves the pleasure of experiencing what the world has to offer. We live in a world and a society that has become quite open and free for the gay and bisexual community, that there seems to be no reason why one should feel ashamed of experiencing their desires. In this case, my advice is to treat this just as a typical love-interest. Ask her out, tell her how you feel, she can only respond in one of two ways; either she will be attracted to you as well, in which case life will be just dandy, or she will not be, which happens in our everyday lives as well."

379,"I am writing this based on 30 years of my own experience of reducing migraine headaches sans medicines. So, this is a proven method, which can be used by all migraine-affected people, with zero side effects. It reduces the frequency of migraine attacks substantially, for sure. Here is my simple but very very effective remedy to prevent/reduce migraine headaches:always cover your eyes with a good-quality pair of sunglasses & also cover your head with a comfortable cap/hat, whenever you go out in the sun/in any kind of glare. Wear the sun-glasses & the cap/hat all the time when you are outdoors, or when you feel that the glare is too much to bear;Eat something at your daily-intake times, without exceptions. What you eat & how much you eat is secondary. What is vital is to feed your stomach at regular intervals, or at/around the time you normally consume food everyday. This eradicates the ill-effects of bile & prevents headaches;Do not keep awake late at night. Ideally, a 11 pm to 6 am sleep is desirable. Also, try to stick to your daily routine, to the extent feasible & avoid erratic daily routines as far as you can;Keep stress as low/less as feasible. Try your best & then, accept the results coolly. Worrying over what is beyond your control is a invitation to migraine headaches;Have more fruits, salads, nuts & other natural foods. Avoid processed/non-veg./fried foods, or consume as less of it as may be possible;For peace of mind, do meditation (focus on breathing) daily, morning & night. Vipassana meditation is very good;Keep this attitude as regards the results, after putting in your best efforts: 0% expectations & 100% acceptance. This will reduce stress & thus, reduce the frequency & intensity of headaches. Do your best & then, accept the outcome with grace & equanimity. This attitude will reduce headaches."

388,"Differentiate scientists from engineers:Engineers are generally only dedicated to building things using knowledge that exists. Scientists can also sometimes do that, but they spend more time looking at things that no one knows anything about.For example, if Jim doesn't know how an engine is constructed but he is required to design pistons in an engine and he spends time researching engine construction, he's still an engineer. But if Jim spent his time working on creating a recipe for a new material to make pistons out of, and that material is something no one knows anything about, then he's a scientist.In general, engineers know more about building things - they typically don't have a PhD (but they can). Scientists almost always have a PhD, and they only know little bits about how to build things. Scientists spend more time analyzing things in broad strokes, in generality, but engineers spend more time looking at the minutiae. But things become confusing since many scientists start out as engineers and the other way round. Also scientists have to frequently build things - they sometimes seek the help or employ engineers, but it is as likely that they figure out how to build things themselves as well. The engineers that scientists employ are sometimes called 'R&D engineers' - and they sometimes like to think of themselves as scientists.Engineers in general have more breadth in topical knowledge over scientists and scientists have more depth in a few topics. Engineers go to scientists when a very specific piece of the puzzle doesn't fit nicely.To conclude, there's also a third category - technicians. Not to knock against them, but they also like to self-identify themselves as scientists or engineers. In my personal opinion, there are far fewer engineers than scientists (that are already very few). Most people are merely technicians looking up things and implementations."

Instead try to learn programming skills, Data analytics or apply with some startups where you get a very good learning experience.Basically you need to understand that the work going on an electrical site is very serious and generally it takes engineers years of experience to handle the heavy electrical machinery therefore they dont allow any fresher to just walk in and work without proper training.You can apply with NTPC as they have a very well structured in plant training during summer."

[2] He spent the first five years of his life in Mangalore, where his maternal grandfather, Ifthikar Ahmed, served as the chief engineer of the port in the 1960s. [8][9][b] According to Khan, his paternal grandfather, Jan Muhammad, an ethnic Pashtun, was from Afghanistan. [11] [12] Khan's father, Meer Taj Mohammed Khan, was an Indian independence activist in Peshawar, British India (present-day Pakistan).‚ÄùHe came from a royal background of rich, succesful famous people who had alot of money. His family is filled with ancestors that were important political figures, one was a activist of India‚Äôs independence, another was a chief engineer of a port.So he clearly had a strong start as he already had several family members to back him up and guide him, he did not come from any poor family.When your grandfather is the cheif of all engineers, your father is a well paid political acitivist. His other grandfather was born in Afghanistan, while his father was born in Pakistan, and SRK was born in India. (His family was born in three different countries)."

I revisit them frequently because I get more out of them every time I go through them.However, books cannot change your life ‚Äì only you can do that. Simply reading the book alone, then moving on to the next one is useless.The books can guide you down the right path, but you must take massive action and dedicate yourself to doing the work.Grit: The Power of Passion and Perseverance by Angela DuckworthAchievement isn‚Äôt reserved for only talented individuals, but for those with passion and perseverance.Grit is about what creates outstanding achievement in people. Through her own story of success, research, science, and interviews with high achievers from various fields, Angela Duckworth reveals what it takes to persevere in any situation.Key Takeaways:Grit = perseverance + passion + purposeWe obsess over talent because it protects our ego ‚Äì if we believe we either have it or we don‚Äôt, we don‚Äôt have to feel bad about not measuring up.Effort has a much greater impact on achievement than talent.Combine small, low-level, daily goals with a larger vision to stay consistently motivated.Grit is changeable with:Interest: enjoy what you‚Äôre doingPractice: deliberate practice to improve on your weaknesses to constantly improvePurpose: know that your work mattersHope: believe in yourself.

395,"At first it will seem useless, as you will end up using it for brief notes (you never refer to), clipping web articles (you most likely won‚Äôt read again) and creating shopping lists. You can do these with a range of other apps. So for the first few months the benefit will be negligible or zero.The key to finding Evernote useful lies in integrating it with how you work; in my case I use it as my information and ongoing thoughts store. So if I get important emails with attachments, I put them in there, write comments and tags and (depending on how you use Evernote) then put it in a notebook. Other things you can do are add meeting minutes, store other files (with your own summaries attached) and almost replace your paper notebooks. I still use the latter, but now I scan my notebook pages into Evernote (which I can search in). You can create reminders and to do lists.If you dump information into Evernote, it will quickly become chaotic. One useful feature is that you can link different notes (pages) together. This can save a lot of time if you currently have to search lots of emails or various file stores. Tagging and notebooks are critical to staying organised, so look up some tips online.One useful think I have found is to create two folders in My Documents on my computer, one is the working folder where I have for example all Word files I am editing for a particular project. I then have an Evernote Sync folder. Once a document is complete, I move it to the Sync folder and erased from my computer. If I need to find the file again I go to Evernote. Don‚Äôt forget that services such as IFTTT and Zapier to connect lots of online services together and can automatically feed information into Evernote. This can include creating a daily summary of all the files changed in shared folders or data from CRM systems. Integration with third party systems such as Google Docs/Drive is useful and improves workflow.Evernote is only useful if you make use of its many features like notebooks, links and tags plus also use it as your main data store. However, if you do that, it is a lifesaver in this age of email and endless Cloud file folder options. Don't forget there are many excellent tutorials online and it is a matter of finding the right usage style for you.A long answer, but I hope it helps. I have no connection with Evernote."
396,"I have to buy something for him. Something special. Something that would remind him of me constantly. It was their wedding anniversary and she felt lost. She had so many gifts in mind but every single one of them would cost a fortune. They barely managed to pay for daily necessities. How was she going to buy him the unforgettable gift? She took out her purse and started counting. 100. 200. 250. 258. Not a rupee more. What could she possibly buy for such paltry amount and at the same time, mesmerize him? She had¬† 2 more hours until he got back home. She had to think something quick. This is not happening. She looked around the house in despair - hoping she'd find something good enough to sell. The house was barely furnished and all they had was old stuff their parents were gracious enough to give as wedding gifts. That's when she laid eyes on her sitar. It suddenly reminded her of this sly music shop owner who mentioned he can fetch her a good price for it. The sitar was part of her family tradition. Her grandmother played it. Her mother played it. Her childhood evenings were spent learning that sitar. She even played it for the entire school audience. It had become a part of her. But I'm not that girl anymore. I have only one responsibility now and that is to make my other half happy. I haven't even touched it for years. She lugged the sitar to the nearby music shop. ""How much can you give me for this?"" she asked the owner. ""This is very old. The strings look like they might collapse any minute. Is it even in tune?""""Oh, yes it does. I tune it every other month,"" she lied through her teeth, ""let me play it for you."" She played the tune she learnt from her mother. As she wrapped it up, the owner just stared at her, mouth wide open. Few more seconds passed and he started clapping. ""That was beautiful. You should play for an audience."" He remarked. He continued, ""I'll loan the money to you. Till you return it to me, I'll keep the sitar in my possession. How much do you need?"" ""Rs. 5000,"" she said without blinking. ""That's too much."" He inspected the sitar. ""I can give you Rs. 3500. In the current market, you won't get more than Rs. 2500 for this. The strings in this sitar are very old. No one uses them anymore.""She was beaming inside. She had already started making a mental list of all the things she could buy with that money. ""That's fine,"" she blurted out. As soon as she had the money in her hands, she headed straight to the gift shop. And there it was, the perfect gift for her husband. A heart-shaped slot where two photos can be inserted. Her husband always wore his family heirloom - a gold locket -¬† around his neck. This would perfectly fit into the locket. She knew he'd love it and at the same time, it'd constantly remind him of her. She rushed back to the house and started cooking his favourite snack. He's going to love my gift. As he entered home, she was waiting at the door for him. ""How was your day?"" she asked. ""Nothing remarkable. You?""""Me too."" she pause for a few seconds and continued, ""Do you know what day today is?""""Of course! Our wedding anniversary! And I think I have the perfect gift for you.""""Yeah, me too! But you show me mine first!""""Okay. Remember how you always wanted to play the sitar as a profession? I bought you new strings and booked a show for you in this fancy new auditorium. You will open for Ravi Shankar! It's going to make you an instant celebrity!""It took her a few seconds to grasp the situation. He continued, ""Your turn. What do you have for me?"" She produced the heart-shaped slots.""This will go perfectly well with your gold locket."" That's when she noticed that he wasn't wearing it today. ""Where is it?"" ""I sold it to book your show,"" he admitted sheepishly.

398,"If you were unsure of your sexuality, and found out that you are actually straight, would you announce it? No. Why should it be any different for bisexuality? It's a preference of who you like. It doesn't affect any of them or their preferences, unless you have feelings for one of them. However, you didn't say that, so I'm gonna assume that that's not the case.If I were you, I'd simply end up with a girlfriend one way or another, and introduce her to them as such: ""Guys, this is my girlfriend ___"" (___ obviously being their name XD). Because, really, it's who you love. They should support you no matter what, and they also shouldn't be bothered by it as you'd be in a relationship, so it's not like they can assume you have feelings for them. Bisexual is just a label for you and others to understand what it is you 'prefer', but as long as you make it clear to your friends that just because you are capable of loving a female like that, doesn't mean you love EVERY female ever, and therefore you don't have feelings for them.Don't worry about it. It's just a label to explain who you are capable of loving. They'll later ask about your sexuality if you do follow my example with the girlfriend thing (I'm not even kidding, do it), but there's a chance they won't too. Besides, it'll probably just be; ""You didn't tell us you were lesbian!"" or ""Are you lesbian?? Why didn't you tell us?!"". Just explain to them that a) you're bisexual, not lesbian, and b) why should you have to make a big deal out of it? People always say it's not a big deal, so why make a big announcement of it? There's no point, that's just hypocritical really."

400,"I believe I could be of help to you. I have just started my open source contributions, after meandering for almost a year, trying to get started. I was facing the same problem as you were, mainly, lack of information on how to start contributing and how to read code.BasicsYou must be familiar with Github and Git. Many open source organisations use Git for managing source control. You must be able to clone a repository, fork it, pull from a repository, push to a repository, send a pull request and you must also know how to manage conflicts.As long as you know this much about Git, you will be able to start contributing.Know the language of your choice thoroughly. For example, if you want to contribute to the Spring Framework, knowing Java in and out is a must. If you want to contribute to the LLVM compiler,knowing C++ well is necessary.How to contributeChoose a projectSee which project interests you and choose accordingly. Are you interested in games? Check out Battle for wesnoth. It is a game written in C++ and Lua. However, be wary that it doesn't exceed your skills. For example, the game I mentioned requires some grasp of AI for any meaningful contribution. If you are not interested in AI then it may not be the right project for you.Join the mailing listEvery project has a mailing list. If you go on their Github page, or their homepage, you will be able to find it. Most of the time, it may be a google group. Sometimes it will be a mailing list on other sites like sourceforge or gna. Join the list, and introduce yourself.I just joined the mailing list for Wesnoth. When you join the list, write a post on the list introducing yourself and telling them that you would like to contribute. They will welcome you with open arms and give you two or three links which you would have to read to understand how to contribute.In my case, they gave me the link to the page where bugs were filed and told me to start on the easiest one.Choose a bugGo to the page where bugs have been filed. Every organisation has bugs in its software. Typically the low priority ones, or the minor ones are not touched. They are left for beginners so that they can read the code by means of fixing the bug.Choose the easiest one. I chose one which required only modifying one line in a file. Ask for helpI couldn't locate the file where the bug was supposed to be, so I posted on the mailing list detailing the bug I intended to resolve and the file¬† in which it could be found. I got a reply immediately. They told me the file where it was located and I resolved it.Send a pull requestOnce you resolve the bug, send a pull request to the organisation. If they accept your code will incorporated in the main repository.Thus, you have started your open source contributions.Hope, I was of help."
401,"One thing to remember about stories you read about is that there are a lot of people who just make things up.¬† Some may be placebo effects (which are shockingly powerful), some may be coincidences, some may be lacking context or reading too much into things, but many personal anecdotes lies--pure and simple.¬† This is especially true with hearsay, where one person tells another person something, who tells someone else something, each person adding their own embellishments, until what gets to you has almost nothing to do with what even appeared to have happened.Since this is an A2A, I will assume that your story is not a lie.¬† There are nonetheless many possible causes.¬† I will list a few of them.¬† The probability of all possible causes should add up to 100%, so the longer the list, the less weight each possibility has.¬† The probability distribution, however, is not uniform.¬† Potential causes that conform with more of what one's general understanding of reality should be given more weight than those that contradict it:1) As you suggested, dreams cause reality.¬† Think about what this possibility implies, from the perspective of the child killer in your dream.¬† He (guessing at pronoun) did not know you were dreaming, and certainly did not know you were dreaming about having your blood drained.¬† He was simply going about his life, which just happened to involve the extremely unusual activity of draining people's blood (in addition to killing children, because he is apparently very busy), and decided to choose you of all people for whatever nefarious reasons--probably thought up long in advance and before you were asleep.¬† Your dream then reached back in time via some mechanism (psychic dream tendrils?), of yet undiscovered by science (and, if discovered, could some people very rich), took control of his brain, and made him drain your blood, all the while thinking it was his own idea.¬† This bizarre scenario goes sharply against almost everything I know about how the world works, so I would only consider it if every single alternative were conclusively disproven.¬† Probability share: very, very small.2) Reality causes dreams.¬† You were anemic for some pre-existing medical reason (might be worth looking into) and slept on your arm causing the pain and redness (or maybe that was related to the anemia, or a separate condition).¬† You felt the effects of the anemia and arm pain while you were asleep, so your subconscious generated a story to explain what it was experiencing.¬† Probability share: High.3) Placebo effect.¬† Your dream scared you, and suggested that your were lacking blood and might have pain in your arm, inducing a placebo reaction.¬† The effects of placebos are well-documented, common, and extremely powerful (they can literally kill you).¬† Probability share: High.4) Coincidence.¬† The dream was unusual, and so were the effects you felt when you woke up, so what are the odds of both of them happening at the same time?¬† Actually, higher than you might think, largely because you wouldn't be asking if you had a boring, forgettable, or nonsensical dream, or any dream followed by nothing interesting happening.¬† Probability share: Moderate to High.5) False Reading.¬† Your dream was of a child-killer stealing your blood.¬† You felt ill and had some arm pain.¬† These are not the same.¬† Did you find a syringe hole?¬† Are you sure the illness was actually caused by lost blood (did you measure how much blood you had before you went to sleep and after you woke up)?¬† Do you have any evidence at all that a person was near you when you were asleep?¬† Do you have any evidence at all this person, if they exist, has killed children?¬† If the answer to any or many of these is ""no"", then your dream was wrong and should count as evidence against dreams having any correlation with reality, not as evidence in favor.¬† Probability share: Not Applicable, but I include this answer because it may diminish the need for any explanation at all.6) Some other explanation I haven't thought of.¬† I like to think that, on a typical late night of binge-Quora writing, I can consider a question from all possible angles and give a 100% perfect and complete explanation.¬† Unfortunately, honesty and humility (those spoilsports!) force me to admit that there will always be an unknown amount of possibilites that I fail consider, no matter how hard I try.¬† Thus, there may be any number of explanations of your experience that command respectable probability shares that I have not included on the above list.¬† Collective Probability Share: Moderate to Very High.Summing up, if we were to draw all of the above explanations on a pie graph, I believe that 2, 3, 4, and 6 would each command large sections of the pie, which isn't very large to begin with because of 5, with 1 being a tiny crumb that fell out of the pan.¬† In other words, not very likely.The same reasoning could be applied to the anecdotes you read about, except that I would add possibility 7) they are lying, (""they"" referring to the individual, or to one or several of the people in the chain of reporting) which would take 75-90% of the pie in each case, with 2, 3, 4, and 6 again finishing off the remainder."

403,"I admitted the undergraduate students to MIT for 28 years, nearly 10 as Dean of Admissions.¬† It is very difficult to describe how one gets admitted because it is a subjective process based on a variety of factors.¬† But let me say that of all the answers below, Anonymous is closest to the truth.¬† Simply put, you need a 'hook', which means something so special that it is pretty rare.¬† (A hook is also known in the admissions business as an 'institutional need', something that the schools want but will never tell the public about.¬† Div 1 athletes, children of major donors or celebrities, best in state, best in nation, academic superstars, someone who is published in a major publication, etc are examples nationally.¬† MIT has its own institutional needs that their outstanding admissions office works hard to identify and admit.)¬† Note that this is not just high scores and perfect grades, as most people believe.¬† It's different.¬†¬† As Anonymous says, for MIT¬† be world-class at something (accent on 'world class'), crush school (that's right - crush it, no excuses) and build writing and interpersonal skills so you can communicate effectively with others.¬† MIT people are action people so the admissions office is looking for people who regularly make things happen for themselves and others with great self-initiative.¬† A deeper than normal curiosity is critical because that screams MIT.¬† And a fearlessness is necessary because not only is MIT the most extraordinary university of its kind on Earth, it's also one of the most demanding.¬† (There's no place to hide in the curriculum there as one can in Ivy schools.)¬† Each of these attributes must be represented by actual evidence in the case.¬† But it's the hook that gets one admitted.If I could tell future applicants anything, it is to understand the culture of the individual school and see if you are a match.¬† For example, MIT is an action place and so is well suited for action-types and not really that suited for intellectual types.¬† Also, do not pick a college based on ranking.¬† That's just ignorance.¬† All ranking systems have been designed to sell products so they are neither neutral authorities nor really true. You must learn about schools yourself in this era of Big Spin.¬† That takes work. And most importantly, don't take advice about college admissions from anyone who has never admitted for a living.¬† Your friends and parents know nothing about such an arcane process and do what we all do - make assumptions about how it appears to work and then act on the assumptions they just made up as if they were true (a process I refer to as M.S.U. - making sh*t up).¬† That never ends well since it isn't based in truth.I hope this helps."
404,"The answer to this question is simple: They don‚Äôt! Not even a tiny little bit!A fetus/baby in the womb. You can clearly see the umbilical cord connected to the placenta in the background.The fetus develops inside what is literally a sack of water inside the mother‚Äôs womb. It does not take a single breath until some time after it is born. The developing fetus/baby gets everything it needs to sustain its life and development through the Umbilical cord. This includes oxygen. The umbilical cord is in turn connected to the Placenta, which is where oxygen and nutrients are switched from the mother‚Äôs bloodstream to the fetus‚Äô/baby‚Äôs bloodstream. So, because of this the fetus/baby does not need to breathe or exhale.During a typical birth the baby comes out first, and then sometime later the placenta comes out. It can be as long as half an hour before the placenta comes out, and in un-normal cases it can be a lot longer. When the baby is first born, it is still connected to the placenta and the mother through the umbilical cord which is almost like a wire hanging out from the mother. As soon as the baby is out in air, it can start breathing using its lungs for the first time, but actually, as long as it has its umbilical cord and the placenta is still connected to the mother, it does not have to. For example Water birth has become much more normal, where the baby is actually born in water, not in air. As long as the umbilical cord is still intact and the placenta has not been birthed, the baby could actually quite happily stay submerged in water without breathing.A water birth where the father holds the placenta in a bowl while the umbilical cord is still attached.In the bad old days doctors and midwives were very keen to make the newborn baby breathe using its lungs as quickly as soon as possible, which is why they sometimes smacked the baby‚Äôs bottom to make it cry out. In modern medicine it is appreciated that the newborn baby can continue to use the umbilical cord for some time, and the baby is allowed to experience a more gentle adaptation to the outside world. It is also thought that leaving the umbilical cord attached for some time will allow the blood in there to be retracted into the baby‚Äôs main body with significant health benefits to the baby.So, in conclusion, fetus/baby does not breathe or exhale inside the womb.

405,"Great is such a subjective term, so I will add some movies that some may or may nor agree with.Oldboy (2003)One of my favorite films, well worth watching.Cat People (1982)One of my faves, a beautiful film with a beautiful leading lady.Caligula (1979)Considered by many to be a terrible movie, I personally thing it's amazing and well worth checking out.The Devil's Advocate (1997)I missed this when it came out, but I caught it recently and I was surprised at what a fun movie this was!Volver (2006/I)I'm not sure if I would call it a theme, but it is part of the plot.Angel Heart (1987)An amazing film that is an overlooked classic.Twin Peaks: Fire Walk with Me (1992)David Lynch, do I need to say anymore?The Witch Who Came from the Sea (1976)A relatively unknown film with an interesting story.The Hotel New Hampshire (1984)A movie that grows on you, not something everyone would like.Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer (1986)A disturbing real life horror movie.Cruel Intentions (1999)A ridiculous soap opera of a movie that is so much fun.Visitor Q (Video 2001)Takashi Miike in one of his harder to watch films, that ends up being no less brilliant by the end.Society (1989)Not your typical horror movie, but interesting.Moebius (2013)Not an easy film to watch, and without any dialogue might be too much for many.Pink Flamingos (1972)Not my fave, but many people love it.Amityville II: The Possession (1982)Most people would say this wasn't a good movie, but I remember enjoying it!That's it for now, if I think of any others I will add them later!EDITED TO ADD :Luna (1979)I was not a huge fan of this film, but I recently saw it and the main plot of this movie is a mother son relationship."
406,"I just learned this, and I thought it was pretty amazing. According to this website 5 Languages of Love (not affiliated with it in any way), which has a quiz you can take to determine your style of communicating affection, there are five different ways we express love:Words of affirmationPhysical touchQuality timeGiftsActs of serviceYou may have different ways of expressing love for each other. Perhaps someone primarily likes to hear the words, but the other mainly loves taking time out of their day to be with you. Maybe one person likes gifts but the other person expresses love through touch. Those are examples of each person conveying affection in different ways, meaning that you may be prone to miscommunication or misinterpreting signs, and it helps to understand that. Take the quiz and see how you prefer to express yourself, and see if your partner might be interested in it as well -- it doesn't take long and I thought it was very revealing."
407,"How did I gain my muscle?Well, that came about after my love affair with Mary Jane(MJ).You see, I was addicted to MJ throughout college, I would miss all my classes to spend time with MJ.When I got home, I would sneak around with MJ.It was your typical first love scenario and you want to do it all the time.Whenever you are in situation like that, you are unaware of the negatives until 1 day you find your mirror looks a bit strange.Unfortunately Mary Jane gave me the munchies and that lead to sweet and sweaty nights.This is me on my 21st birthday. Do not be fooled by the clothes, I was skinny fat.When you are skinny fat you look skinny with your clothes on but when it is off, you can be used as modeling clay.‚ÄúIt is not me Mary Jane, it is you. You have to go‚ÄùLater that year I joined the gym with the goal of getting big and shredded.Over the next 3 years I started reading about everything fitness.Fad diets, fancy training and bullshit supplements.I consistently tried new things to get the edge. I wanted quick results and I was not going to spare any cost.About 3 years later.As you can see, my progress was not much to write home about.There had to be a better way.7 years later.It is safe to say I rectified what I was doing wrong but this should have not taken me 7 years.What was I doing wrong?Everything.Here is what I learned.My diet is a variation of these foods when trying to add muscle.Diet - Ignore your diet and you will not go anywhere in regard to fat loss or muscle building. I was eating take outs regularly and my sweet tooth controlled me. Food is a natural athlete‚Äôs anabolic, use it as such.I figured out my maintenance calories and added 300 to gain lean mass.I focused on getting 1 gram of protein per lb of body weight. You don‚Äôt need 2 grams as many say, studies have shown you can build muscle on a lower protein intake.[1]My fats were set to 0.45 gram per lb of mass and the rest I filled in with carbs.I occasionally fit in my favorite treats like doughnuts and cupcakes.Training - This was a mess, my form was non-existent. My partner and I were benching 120 kg together, he would spot me and I would lie to myself that it was all me.Master the basics and you will achieve a great body that you may never need to experiment with other training methods. The edge only works when you got the basics down. The basics are you lifting compound movements with the correct form.Progressively get stronger, this does not mean you should rush to bench a 100 kg. It means you must lift a weight that is challenging. That could be 50 kg 60 kg etc. Overtime you want to get strongerControl the weight, there‚Äôs 3 parts to the lift, eccentric, concentric and isometric. You need to do all 3 things to gain mass.I started to lift with intent, my mind to muscle improved. I could visualize the muscle working.I used variations of push pull legs[2], upper lower body split[3] and bodybuilding split.[4]Rest - I would love going to gym 7 days a week, I never believed in rest. Now I go in 4 to 5 days and usually it is an hour-long workout.Tracking - How do you know where you are going, when you don‚Äôt know where you are coming from. You make changes based on what you see in your training journal.I tracked my workouts, every single lift and focused on getting stronger.I measured my waist to know if I am gaining fat.I took progress pictures over time to see the results.I tracked my calories and adjusted them as needed on MyFitnesspal.Supplements - They are optional and most cases never needed. I relied on supplements to do the work for me, unfortunately they don‚Äôt. I now use them when I cannot get my calories in from whole foodsConsistency - The most important of all, you have to be consistent with the above. Find what works for you and do that consistently over the years and you will get the results.Cold days, lazy days, long work day, I still get it done.I h..."

409,"I‚Äôm writing this on Father‚Äôs Day. Yesterday, I drove 250 miles round trip to have dinner with my adult daughter who was working at her fun part time job after her first week at the full-time job that she got after graduating college and getting married. It‚Äôs a trip that I have made many times and we still communicate pretty much every day.I regret the emotional damage it did to my daughter. Although I tried everything to make sure she was emotionally protected, I simply couldn‚Äôt afford the endless litigation that my ex-wife brought to the table. Heck, my ex-wife once threatened my daughter that she would call her lawyer if my daughter she didn‚Äôt stop crying.Ok, a little background. When my daughter was young, it was a good day for her if she didn‚Äôt cry at school. She was always emotional but I always knew how to deal with her to calm her down. And it drove my ex-wife nuts our daughter would go to me when she was upset. My ex-wife was one of those mothers who would put the baby half way between the two of us just to see which parent she would crawl to first. The results were always the same and that made my ex-wife very angry. She once told me that she wanted another kid because maybe the next one would favor her and not me. The result of the divorce was my daughter spent years in therapy.Even though it has been well over a decade since the divorce, and we both have moved on and have remarried, I still get angry thinking about the amount that my daughter suffered. Over the past month, I got to spend 6 hours at my daughter‚Äôs graduation with my ex-wife and then the next week with all of the ex-family members who also hold an incredible grudge at me for fighting for my daughter. Great times. A divorce when there are kids involved means that there will be events that you will always have to be around them. And no matter how long it has been, there will still be issues.As for what I could have done to make a difference, I‚Äôm really not sure. Personally, I would have stuck it out in a marriage that wasn‚Äôt all that great if it would have helped my daughter but it wasn‚Äôt my choice in the matter. I‚Äôm much happier without her but it still makes me angry to know what my daughter went through."

411,"Once you post a status to Facebook, you are more or less hoping to receive interaction from others, right? It could be like clicking, commenting, or simply ... watching. And in order to attract these activities, in addition to good or right post content, there are a number of other factors that also contribute to how other people interact with the content you post to Facebook. A few interesting things that Facebook people sometimes don't know.1. Posts with photos that are liked more than 53%According to data from Kissmetric, posts with photos receive 53% more likes and 104% more comments than posts that are full of words. And if there is a link in that post, the number of users clicking on the link will be 84% higher than the traditional post posting. And of course, beautiful photos with profound content, self-explanatory ability are getting more and more interaction.Meanwhile, a survey by Wishpond Research said that the photo post will receive 120% more interaction than normal, and the photo album will receive 180% more interaction, a very impressive number. This means that if you have a lot of photos, you should put them in the same album, so it will attract more friends than posting them individually.2. Posts are liked and commented moreWriting short states is not just for Twitter but also for Facebook. If your article has less than 250 characters, you will get more than 60% of the maximum interaction, and if you drop it below 80 characters, this number will increase to 66%. You can also see this with adjusting yourself, that when you encounter too long posts on Facebook, we tend to ignore, especially if it doesn't relate to yourself. Therefore, keeping it short and concise is very important.3. Using emoticons will be 33% more commentsIf you think emoticons are only for teenagers, you may have to think again. According to AMEX OPEN Forum, a specialized place for entrepreneurs and entrepreneurs to share experiences with each other, the post-emoticon posts will be 33% more commented by others than traditional postings. And also with emoticons, you will get more than 33% share, 57% more likes. The reason for this is because emoticons contribute to making your post more friendly, and of course there is far more ""emotion"" than traditional dry characters.4. Posts on Thursdays and Fridays are more interactiveCompared to other days of the week, the BuddyMedia study shows that if you post status on Thursday and Friday, people will see, like or comment more than 18%. It's understandable, because these are the last two days of the weekend, and during that time people tend to go to Facebook more than work.The study also surveyed various fields, such as sports, retail, electronics, cars, health ... to see which days are most suitable for posting relevant status. Although the results vary slightly, the focus is mainly on Wednesday to Friday. Surely no one wants to post status on Monday and Tuesday.5. The post contains more than twice the comment questionQuestions are one of the most effective forms of interactivity. Kissmetric says that their question-based posts are 100% more commented by others, which is double, compared to a traditional text post. HubSpot research firm also came to the same conclusion, ie the comment into your state will increase, but clicking like and sharing will decrease compared to other types of content.You also need to know that the words you put into the question will also affect the interaction. HubSpot found that if your question contains ""so"", ""which"", ""who"", it will get more comments from others. For example, I posted a status like this: ""Have 100$, should take a girlfriend to eat tea or eat hotpot?"" then people will enter more comments, although this is a relatively ""closed"" question. With more ""open"" questions, such as ""why"", ""how"", people will be less interactive because it requires thinking before writing a comment.6. 35% of users click like a Page to participate in competitionsIf you have a Page of your own and want to attract more fans, organize a contest, because according to Buffer, 35% of Facebook users click like Page just to participate in the contest. A title contest for photos has also received 5.5 times more comments than regular posts. According to BuddyMedia's research, test-related words, such as ""winners"", ""wins"", ""participation"", ""competitions"", ""competitions"" will attract users to interact more.7. Most Facebook users use social networking support servicesBusiness or social networking users say that they feel social networking support services give a rather high profit performance, helping them save time and effort for the next. close to customers. Indeed, according to statistics from Sell Real Likes, a company that provides services to support likes, comments, followers on social networks, it is assumed that in 3 companies, 2 companies contacted them for cooperation and on average in 2018 the total number of people buying their services increased 5 times compared to 5 years ago.8. 42% of users click like Page to enjoy discounts and promotionsThis data is given by survey company Socially Stacked. According to the company Wildfire Interactive, the advertising campaign with coupons attracted people to interact more than the campaign gift or related campaign requires people to participate in the competition.Good luck!"
412,"Howard Dean himself has said that he think it‚Äôs ‚Äúunlikely‚Äù that Donald Trump is using cocaine, but that he can‚Äôt rule it out and that he‚Äôd like to know more.Howard Dean stands by Donald Trump cocaine tweetI saw Dean‚Äôs tweet when it went live during the debate, and while I think it far more likely that Trump has a sinus infection or some other minor cold that was making him snuffly, it is a fair point that Trump‚Äôs behavior is not inconsistent with someone who is routinely using stimulants such as cocaine.I personally don‚Äôt think Trump is using cocaine or other stimulants, but it‚Äôs not that far of a reach. And the weird nature of the medical releases made by the Trump campaign, and the candidate‚Äôs persistent claims to have ‚Äúgreat stamina‚Äù (something which stimulants would make much easier to sustain) and the campaign‚Äôs constant attacks regarding his opponent‚Äôs health put his own health quite fairly into legitimate question.Instead, Trump‚Äôs campaign has taken the position that there were no sniffles; apparently, those weird snuffly noises we were hearing were caused by a ‚Äúdefective microphone‚Äù."

414,"Bzzt! Wrong assumption. About 70 percent of the adults in the USA don‚Äôt have college degrees. There are 18.5 million white blue collar production workers and 14 million white service workers. If you put them together with their white spouses, that‚Äôs only about 40 percent of the people in the USA who don‚Äôt have college degrees. So these are the ‚Äúpeople without highly p;aid jobs‚Äù referred to here.A majority of working class people in the USA don‚Äôt vote at all. And thus they don‚Äôt vote for Republicans.But there‚Äôs another major group of people without college degrees: Small business owners. There are 17 million of them and they are 86 percent white ‚Äî much whiter (86 percent white) as a group than manual and service workers. Moreover they vote more regularly than the working class does and they tend to be predominantly Republicans (78 percent say they are conservative on economic issues). And their average income is $102,000 a year ‚Äî so they are not low paid. We could add in real estate agents and brokers into this list.There are also 1.8 million managers, 8.8 million supervisors, and 1.6 million cops whose jobs don‚Äôt require a college degree. Some may have a degree, but it is clear that there are tens of millions of non-working-class people in the United States who lack such a degree.If we add in their white spouses, you can account for all of the 29 million people without college degrees who voted for Trump in 2016.It‚Äôs been true for decades that a sizeable minority of union members vote for Republicans. But the more affluent small business and supervisorial-bureaucratic classes are really much more of a major base for the Republicans. This also explains why the average income of Republican voters is higher than Democrat voters."

418,"Original question: Does your graduation score matter during MBA.If you are aiming for iBank and Top consulting companies, yes your graduation college and marks matter a lot.Yes it does. Almost all colleges allocate certain points to your graduation marks.

419,I guess the question itself is the origin of dilemma... Rather you should be asking yourself why do I want to watch it. Porn is all about unrealistic behaviour. The characters involved are not lovers but they are actors. Porn is all about humiliation of women and dominance of men. It is a major cause of human trafficking. Can make you addicted as of dopamine secretion. Physiologically affects you giving a fake image of sex. Reproduction is a necessary life process but it make you sick if it gets over your mind. I myself was an addict for 3 consecutive years and that's why I strictly advice you not to watch it. Porn isn't natural. Though masturbation is natural (though I won't recommend that also) and normal but over doing it oftenly comes along watching porn which makes it bad for health and a major factor of times waste. AVOID PORN
420,"That is hard. Really hard! And the difficulty to start trusting again gets bigger according to how much you had trusted that person before and how that person broke your trust.I think, that person is the one who should prove himself/herself again for you to start trusting that person again, because it is that person‚Äôs fault that the trust was broken (unless it was a misunderstanding between you two).Starting to trust a person again who broke your trust is a scary thing, unless that person IS REALLY now a trustworthy person and has repented for breaking your trust and has been working hard to prove that the person is trust worthy.But, I must say, in case you have lost trust in all other people around you because of that one person who has broken your trust, then you must understand that not everybody is the same and really kind and nice people (like me ;p) still exist in this world. Do not lose hope. Basic trust among us humans is what that keeps the world still going and helps to maintain harmony (at least a bit). But, it is not easy to find such good people. So you must take your safety measures. Trust people around you to some extent, but don‚Äôt trust them fully. Be alert and aware of what is happening around you. Only time can answer if all the people around you are really good people.Finally, let‚Äôs stay good in heart and be a human. Cheers!"

422,"When I was about 8 or 9, my parents bought me an iPad so I could play games and watch videos without me bothering them. When I was around 12, I was looking through the internet, and one way or another, I came across porn for the first time. I was interested and going through puberty like any other boy my age would be, and I watched more and more of it as time went on.As someone who‚Äôs growing up in an extremely Christian household, my parents were very strict about things. I didn‚Äôt get my phone until I turned 13, and I‚Äôm denied any kind of social media until I‚Äôm 18. I‚Äôve never had a sleepover before, which I think of as a crucial part of growing up. I‚Äôve never had a girl over at my house, and have never hung out with a girl outside of school. I didn‚Äôt watch much TV growing up; I never really watched Disney channel, and I‚Äôve never seen a full episode of spongebob to this day. My parents are very homophobic, so I‚Äôm denied being friends with or hanging out with anybody they consider ‚Äútoo gay for their household‚Äù. All this, leading up to my porn habits, eventually lead to my mom searching through my iPad and finding my search history.She was hysterical. She yelled at me, beat me with a belt, and overall threw about every insult she could think of at me. She immediately told my dad, who proceeded to do the same to me. Long story short, I wasn‚Äôt allowed to use my iPad for a good few months or so, and my parents installed an app on my iPad and phone that lets them track my search history and screen time, as well as disable my phone at any time they wanted.I‚Äôm 13 now, and my parents haven‚Äôt gotten any more lenient. I‚Äôm often downplayed for being known as the kid who‚Äôs never really done much, and it‚Äôs taken a toll on my self-esteem and social life.All that being said, if I had a daughter that was watching porn, I would sit down and have a conversation with her. I‚Äôd ask her why she was doing so, who or what introduced her into it, and inform her of the dangers of watching porn and what it could do to her and her health. One thing I wouldn‚Äôt do, though, is punish her. Being introduced to and watching porn it‚Äôs something that every child goes through in their lives at one point or another.You can‚Äôt take complete control of what your child is exposed to on the internet, only how they react to it and what they know it could do to them."
423,"Both Uber and Lyft have a large presence in Atlanta. I believe there are a couple other small startups trying to get into that space but they don‚Äôt have much of the market and I have never tried them. I've tried both Uber and Lyft and settled on using Uber early on. I found that I felt Uber was a little more professional than Lyft, but that was a few years ago. You can't really go wrong with either.Both are far and away better than taxis in a city like Atlanta. Atlanta isn't the type of city where you can just step to the curb and hail a cab like New York is. Aside from a select few places around Atlanta, like MARTA stations or the airport, you have to call the taxi company to hail a cab. Opening up my phone and pressing a few buttons is just way too convenient and I generally feel safer when taking an Uber or Lyft. I've also found that car sharing services are a lot more consistent than taxis in Atlanta in terms of quality of service.TL;DR You can't really go wrong with Uber or Lyft, but both are far better and far more convenient than taxis in Atlanta."

425,Don't accuse your spouse of cheating unless you have solid proof. Just ask your spouse calmly ‚Äúhave they ever cheated or thought of cheating ‚Äú . prepare your self for the one answer you don't want to hear.If they say yes ‚Ä¶ your marriage is on trouble suggest consouling if that's what you BOTH want.If the answer is no‚Ä¶.

Then apologize for thinking the worst.Married couples assume to much. The reality is.. Neither are mindreaders.

427,"Compare tourist attractions? Both boroughs just like the 3 other NYC boroughs, have unique as well as similar attractions. Both have beach attractions, but you can only see Coney Island-type of attractions in Brooklyn. Only Staten Island has got the ferry that allows you to have a more closer view of Lady Liberty. Generally my impressions of parks in both are similar, although I find that Brooklyn‚Äôs Prospect Park is admittedly better known than Staten Island‚Äôs Silver Lake or Clove Lakes.Brooklyn has the Brooklyn Bridge Park, but Staten Island has got Sailors Snug Harbor. Plus, with the emerging Fresh Kills Park in Staten Island, you‚Äôll find it hard looking for something similar in Brooklyn. But then again, you can see Floyd Bennett Field in Brooklyn, which is also a huge, expansive park, being formerly among NYC‚Äôs airports converted into a park. Oh, well, you can find Jacques Marchais museum of Tibetan Art only in Staten Island. So, whichever attractions you‚Äôll decide to visit in either borough will call for you to draw from your personal preferences, time, inclinations plus available logistics.You can take:the bus that crosses both boroughs via the Verrazzano Bridgethe train (R, 4, 5, J,Z) from White Hall, Bowling Green, or Broad Street. Then walk the distance to the South Ferry station of the Staten Island ferry boat.your own car to cross the I-278 via the Verrazzano Bridge again. Or take a cab."
428,"I take Spirulina daily 3 grams AM and 3 grams PM and I have been doing this for many years. I have noticed my health is more balanced and easier to maintain since I have been taking it. NASA even say you could survive on it alone.Here are some bits from various sources including the Diet DiaryDiet Diary: Astronauts‚Äô meal ‚Äî Power-food for earthlingsSpirulina, an ancient staple food of the Azetacs and Mesoamericans, is now available as a food supplement at health food storesSpirulina, a blue-green algae that is available in the form of powder, capsule and tonic, can help regulate blood sugar, blood pressure and cholesterolSpirulina, an ancient staple food of the Azetacs and Mesoamericans, is now available as a food supplement at health food stores. The blue-green algae shot to fame in the 1970s when National Aeronautical and Space Agency (NASA), USA, used it for astronauts food in space Spirulina is rich in proteins (60%), amino acids, essential fatty acids, Gamma-linolenic acid (GLA) fatty acids, nucleic acids (DNA and RNA), beta-carotene (pro-vitamin A), vitamins- B, C & E, minerals like iron, potassium, magnesium, sodium, phosphorus and calcium, and phytochemicals such as chlorophyll (the green pigment) and phycocyanin (a blue pigment). Its outstanding nutritional profile, high protein and low calorie count makes it a ‚Äòsuperfood‚Äô.Centuries ago, the Aztecs and the Mayas realised the healing properties of spirulina and enjoyed this source of vegetable nutrition as a ‚Äòpower-food‚Äô to boost their energy levels and enhance stamina.Recent scientific research has revealed numerous health benefits of this ‚Äòsuper-food‚Äô. Spirulina has been shown to help regulate blood sugar, blood pressure and cholesterol, alleviate pain, inflammation and allergies, balance the immune system, improve digestion by increasing good gut flora and deliver antioxidant activity to protect from life-threatening diseases like cancer, Alzheimers and strokes.It has also been shown to suppress appetite and help weight watchers. Its high beta-carotene content helps maintain good skin and hair.A study conducted at the JC Bose Institute of Life Sciences, Bundelkhand University, Jhansi, published in ‚ÄòCurrent Pharmaceutical Biotechnology‚Äô in 2005, reported that spirulina improves the activity of white blood cells, stimulates antibodies and increases the population of natural killer cells.Spirulina‚Äôs concentrated nutrition makes it an ideal food supplement for people of all ages and lifestyles, fussy eaters and especially those who do not manage to eat adequate amount of vegetables. However, pregnant and lactating women and people allergic to seafood or seaweed must consult their physician.Tropical weather, strong sunshine, pure water resource and pollution-free environment is all what Spirulina needs for its cultivation. However, if water is polluted or contaminated with heavy metals, it is not suitable for spirulina cultivation as these metals and toxins will get highly concentrated in spirulina and make it unsuitable for human consumption.

432,"The syllabus for UGC NET English is extremely vast, but unfortunately there is no shortcut-it is a continuous process, there is no point starting a month before the test and thinking you‚Äôre going to clear it. You need to strictly dedicate a certain amount of time every day for the preparation; make it part of our routine. Firstly, one has to be thorough with one's MA coursework. Get a general idea about all literary periods (right from Chaucer to the postmodern/contemporary), major authors and their works.Make sure to have read a standard history of British literature book- A Critical History of English Literature by David Daiches, History of English Literature by Edward Albert, An Outline History of English Literature by W H Hudson are some of the affordable choices. Also read Beginning Theory by Peter Barry. While you are reading through these, make sure to collect as much info as possible about each important author/critic and works mentioned in it. You could use the Oxford Companion to English Literature for this. It is a costly book to buy, but most libraries will have a copy in their reference section. Or you could buy the Concise version which is affordable and supplement it with info you collect from the web and the library. Reading entries from the Oxford companion (the latest edition is better as it will be the most updated) daily will help us to learn about works and authors from other literatures like American literature, Post-colonial literatures, world literatures in English etc that you won't find in the British literature history texts.Another important step is to be thorough with terms from M H Abrams' Glossary of Literary Terms. You need to make sure to have studied at least one or two entries from the Glossary daily.Also stay updated on contemporary developments in the field of literature especially the important literary awards like the Booker Prize, Pulitzer Prize, Nobel Prize etc.Maintaining a healthy reading habit is also important. Also solve previous question papers to get an idea about the kind of questions asked.An important step: Do not ignore Paper I as many people tend to do, because it is easy to score marks in this paper, which will help in increasing your average percentage, and thereby the chances of making the cut-off. You may buy any good guide for Paper I available in the market and practice as many sample questions as possible.While the NET is a hard nut to crack, with timely and systematic preparation, it is doable. Simply solving previous question papers is not enough, you need to develop good knowledge of your subject. Combined study is a good idea if you have friends who are also preparing for the same. All the best! :)"

435,"Satire is the use of humor to expose someone or something's vices or flaws. In The Canterbury Tales, Geoffrey Chaucer uses satire to expose the faults of institutions, and common stereotypes of¬† his time. Satire is broken into six elements, all of which are prevalent in the tales.1. Verbal Irony - to say one thing and mean something else2. Mockery - to make something the laughing matter3. Understatement - implying the opposite something by saying less than one means4. Overstatement - implying something by exaggeration5. Parody - a mocking imitation6. Sarcasm - the use of praise to mock someoneEven in the General Prologue, the reader is exposed to Chaucer's satiric tone. This is especially true when he introduces to us the characters. For example, The Knight's¬† description is understatement. He is meant to poke fun at the Knights's of Chaucer's time that no longer followed the Code of Chivalry. Usually, the more Chaucer dislikes a character the more prevalent satire is in their description. An example of this is the Pardoner, his horrible description is overstatement to show what a horrible person he is. Also the animalistic description of him is a parody for the same purpose. Corruption of the Catholic Church was a major problem during Chaucer's time and, is a major theme in The Canterbury Tales. Through the use of satire, he exposes this issue to the audience. A major example of this is the overstatement of how bad the religious figures. The only moral religious figure, the parson, is a understatement whose pure lifestyle is meant to exemplify the adulterated lifestyles of the other clergy members. Hope this helped!!!!"

I only know the term from old Scooby Doo episodes.We don't have the word ‚ÄúTaffy‚Äù here, so if anyone wants taffy (rather than toffee or fudge), they would need to make it or import it.I asked an American living here what it was and I seem to remember she said it was softer than toffee, but not the same as fudge. If so, it might be different enough to import some, but probably not different enough to displace those two very popular types of traditional sweets*. If there aren't many people who want it, its unlikely to be economic to make it here. Especially if part of its appeal is in being a traditional american sweet.*I like bonfire toffee the best.

446,"No, it's not too late. Learning piano is one of the best experience that I have ever had and I totally recommend it to you. However, there are some difficulties that I think you should be aware of:- Sometimes you will feel frustrated because there are many kids (5-6 years old) on youtube playing the same piece that you are playing flawlessly.¬†- Learning piano is not easy. To play a classical piece well, you need to understand all the detail of the piece, i.e.: all the voices on the left and right hands (at any time of playing, you should be able to switch between listening to your left hand and your right hand playing), feeling the beats, having clean legato, understanding the chord progression, dynamics,...It can take couple of months (30'-1h of practicing a day) just to play a short piece (1 - 2 minutes) flawlessly. - Please have a piano teacher, he/she will point out many mistakes that you have. When I play, I make many mistakes that I am not aware of ( having tension on the fingers, the legato is not clean, the notes played by the 4th and 5th fingers do not sound the same as other fingers,... ). She will also help you make the piece sound much better on the phrasing and dynamics, so that the music will take off. - Please practice counting the beats and using the metronome and study music theory right in the beginning. I didn't practice counting carefully before and now I have difficulty learning complicated pieces. You will need music theory if you want to understand what's going on with the piece, and it makes playing piano not just the action of pressing the keys.- It's hard to practice piano in a right way. I often played the whole piece many times to enjoy it, rather than practicing phrase by phrase to listen and fix my mistakes. Playing the piece many times is time consuming, and you will not have time left to work on your mistakes. The best way to learn is to break the piece into smaller chunks, and spend time practicing each chunk perfectly. Many people advise to practice from the hardest chunks to the easiest chunks, although I often do from the beginning to the end. Your teacher will tell you more about good practicing methods.¬† I think if you can study both music theory and piano, have a good piano teacher, and stick with it for 2+ years, you will enjoy your experience very much."

Rape has been defined under Section 375 of IPC, 1860 and it endows that a man is said to enunciate rape when he penetrates his penis to any extent into the vagina of a woman. How far it has gone inboard vagina is intangible. Even slightest penetration of penis by a man into the vagina of a woman amounts to rape. Marital Rape refers to inexpedient sexual intercourse by a man with his own wife which is achieved by unlawful force, threat of force, or physical violence, or when she is in capacious to give her consent to such sexual copulation.

455,"First of all, Shaq has a vested interest in protecting and advancing his own legacy by discounting Tim Duncan as a center. In nearly every all-time NBA ranking, O‚ÄôNeal is ranked behind Duncan. Therefore, disqualifying Duncan from the list would effectively advance Shaq a spot in the discussion of the greatest big men to play the game.Let‚Äôs also acknowledge that rankings and even position estimates are very subjective. Skill sets are changing; at one time a 7-footer like Dirk Nowitski would have been told to not shoot threes because that‚Äôs something that guards do; today he‚Äôs #15 all-time in 3-pointers made. We might call Lebron James a small forward even though he‚Äôll be guarding a power forward on a nightly basis and the offense runs through him, with the ball in his hands as often as any point guard. Stephen Curry shoots the ball more than any shooting guard and the ball-handling responsibility moves around so much with the semi-positionless Warriors that he‚Äôs certainly not a ‚Äútraditional‚Äù point guard, but we call him one anyway. James Harden is a shooting guard who leads his team in assists, dominates possession of the ball, and plays alongside a nominal point guard/defensive specialist in Patrick Beverley whose offensive contributions are significantly more limited. And does anyone even know what position Giannis Antetokounmpo plays? He‚Äôs grown since entering the league and is probably legitimately 7‚Ä≤0‚Ä≥ but Coach Kidd suggests he should be considered a point guard for the Bucks moving forward.Bottom line: we can assign these position labels, but ultimately who cares what they call you as long as you produce on the court, and that‚Äôs exactly what Tim Duncan did.The reason many people think of him as a power forward goes back to the start of his career, when he was playing alongside David Robinson after being drafted. He also possesses tremendous versatility with excellent passing skills and a strong midrange game, and the power forward position is often perceived as being the more skilled, ‚Äúfinesse‚Äù position of the two as opposed to the low-post battling of the two. ButAccording to Gregg Popovich, Duncan was the Spurs‚Äô starter at center for the past 15 years; the exact number is a likely figure of speech from the acerbic Spurs coach but non-coincidentally it closely aligns with the end of the Robinson era in San Antonio. So for Shaq to say Duncan isn‚Äôt even a true big man is a bit much to swallow. But like I noted earlier, any attempt at ranking all NBA players regardless of era or position is going to be hopelessly imprecise anyway, so he‚Äôs free to consider Duncan any way he wants."

457,"I am cognizant of the fact after reading the top answers for this answer that every exceptional and great scene of The Dark Knight Trilogy and the comics and the games have been cited and voiced, so there's no point in answering from the Movie point of view, because people over here according to me have described a particular scene from the movie and then went on to conclude in a line as to how did it effect the world.Rather I want to take a Movie Vs Reality approach in my answer. I will take different aspects and characteristics of the Batman and Bruce Wayne (Which I can make out of after having seen the trilogy for at least 10+ times) which have been displayed to the audience by the creators and directors.So Coming right to it,(This list is not at at all exhaustive and can be decoded and improvised according to one's appetite)Responsibility: Bruce Wayne went on to become the silent protector because he sensed a feeling of responsibility towards his city which was shattered and consumed by atrocities and lawlessness which also took his away his loved parents from him. He didn't want that to happen with the other inhabitants of Gotham City.But in real life, who are we responsible towards? We are responsible towards our parents, our life-partners, children and ultimately oneself. If you are dirty rich, then you've an obligation towards the needy people. You don't need to wear a cape for that. Perseverance and Patience: Bruce Wayne and Batman both lost everything they once had. Bruce Wayne lost his parents, his love, his friends (After the Birthday debacle in Batman Begins), his wealth and everything else he had cherished, his own Palace of a home. Batman lost Harvey Dent, he lost all the people who were killed by Bane, he lost his physical power to Bane, and much more.But in reality, we are faced with unsatisfactory jobs, we lose our loved ones, we lose jobs, homes but not faced with the herculean task of a city. We can look up to Mr. Wayne and Batman is that Life is all be being Patient. Patience is the key to lead a happy and content life. All is never lost, until you perceive it to be lost. Someone can take your wealth, but not your patience, not your will power. So never ever be under a false impression that you've lost EVERYTHING. Sacrifice: Bruce Wayne and The Dark Knight sacrificed everything they had. Bruce sacrificed his wealth, models, and a billionaire life. The Dark Knight sacrificed his identity for protecting his near ones. He sacrificed his Life for his city (Well, technically he is dead now in Gotham, after the third installment)In your life, if there comes a moment where you have to sacrifice something, do not think twice about it. It is just for the greater good. You just don't know what good just yet. Nobody is asking you to live a life of a recluse. We need a bit of materialism in our lives, but when the times call for it, don't hold back. You're Sacrificing for a better Tomorrow. Health: In order to protect his city, the man in black armored suit had to be physically and mentally healthy. He had to fight 20 thugs at a time and then his fears were abused by Ra's Al Ghul, his mental health lacerated by the Joker, and was physically broken by Bane. But why do we fall Bruce? In reality, to be successful in work, relationship and life we need to be physically healthy and mentally free. We just cannot consume Junk, Alcohol and Cigarettes like addicts, well I accept all three help touch the taste buds gently but don't let it control you. Eat well, you do not need to have greens daily. Walk 10,000 steps, no need to run a marathon. Limit the rest to a monthly affair.  Right Vs. Wrong: Bruce¬† Wayne knew that by portraying himself as a squashed up billionaire was wrong, but in order for a greater good and for a importance purpose, it was correct. He had the awareness and the basic premise betwe..."

How do we know that you'll come back?Because you always do. Think. Think hard. Do you remember it now? This is not your first time here, is it? You have come to us before. Perhaps in a different place and time. But you have.Everyone has.So, why do we do it? Why do we fall in love with a shiny new toy only to throw it away in a couple of days?Here's the reason, and if you read just one line in this answer, this is the one you should -Sometimes, we fall in love with the ""idea of possessing something"" rather than the thing itself.You are here on this thread. Tell me, does reading every new trick in these answers give you a little dopamine rush, even though you haven't implemented it yet? When you sit down to apply it, do you feel the rush fading away? Do you then abandon the trick and come back to this thread to get a new trick and a new dopamine shot?If the answers to all these questions are affirmative, then perhaps you're more in love with ""the vision"" of you sitting in a dark room and working hard, having overcome your procrastination; rather than actually overcoming your procrastination, sitting in a dark room, and working hard.Can that be?So, what's the answer?There is none. Procrastination is just a symptom. A symptom of the fact that you don't realize just how short and precious your time on this planet is. Or how illogical it is to while it away. Procrastination shouldn't be a problem, any more than ""I know how important breathing is, but sometimes, I don't feel like doing it and keep putting it off"" is a problem.I mean, can you imagine Elon Musk logging in to Quora and asking the question -""I have to send rockets to Mars, but I can't stop procrastinating. What should I do?""But we can‚Äôt all be Musks, can we? So, let‚Äôs pretend that our stupidity has an official sounding name - ‚Äúprocrastination‚Äù. Let‚Äôs pretend that it is a ‚Äòreal‚Äô problem for which an ‚Äòefficient‚Äô solution must exist, which we‚Äôll perhaps find someday on some obscure quora or reddit thread.And until we do, let‚Äôs keep using ‚Äòprocrastination‚Äô as an excuse to waste our time.In case we‚Äôre meeting for the first time,Hi, I‚Äôm Abhimanyu Sood, the storyteller.Thanks for reading my answer‚Ä¶"

460,"Before I start answering this question, I would like to say that there‚Äôs no organization in this world (except a few) who doesn‚Äôt want to expand. Even a street vendor in India who rises to popularity wants to expand within the city and even beyond that. So, first and foremost thing that Spotify isn‚Äôt available in India is not because they don‚Äôt want to expand. They surely want to expand, not only in India but in almost all countries in the world. In fact, think about it yourself, why wouldn‚Äôt Spotify want to expand in India, being the second most populous country in the world?Moving on to the main part of the answer, there are several reasons why Spotify isn‚Äôt available in India. Music licensing is one such trouble and it‚Äôs legal equivalent of herding sheep in space. Launching in a new market involves thousands of hours of legalese and negotiations with many people spanning many companies, and there is also generally large upfront investments needed, often of several million dollars. Even with all that work, things will only be partially under their (Spotify) control - they will need others to allow them to have their music on the service - until they‚Äôve managed to convince the major labels in a country like T-Series, Sony Music Company to name a few, they simply cannot launch.India is of course an important market that they want to be in, but it's also an enormous country and therefore the label landscape is also enormously complex.Adding to that, India is a country with very spotty internet connectivity, something they're not used to (something similar was quoted by Snapchat‚Äôs CEO on being questioned about expanding Snapchat in India), and which creates a technical hurdle on top of the legal complexities. Nothing is unsolvable, of course, they have awesome people for both the problems, but it's non-trivial and they're not here yet.Once Spotify arrives in India, lite version can be launched for people having slow internet connectivity but tackling legal actions with dominance of major labels will tend to be their prime concern. Until Spotify isn‚Äôt available in India, you can refer to Sahil Singh's answer to How do I use Spotify in India? and continue using Spotify on your desktop / laptop / smartphone.I almost forgot to mention one more thing. Though it‚Äôs not the reason why Spotify isn‚Äôt available in India but it might be one of the highlights of this topic. Piracy, yes, you heard it right. We, Indians (majority) are so used to piracy that we won‚Äôt ever pay for paid subscription which is the primary source of Spotify‚Äôs revenue. In near future, even if Spotify is made available in India, number of paid subscribers will be very less in comparison to FREE users. In India, piracy can be broadly divided into 2 categories:First category deals with things for which we feel guilty at some point of time. This category includes piracy of movies.From the above point, it‚Äôs obvious that this section contains things for which we don‚Äôt feel guilty at all and there‚Äôs no scope of feeling so in near future. It includes piracy of softwares (especially Microsoft Windows, Microsoft Office etc), Android applications, songs etc. I once asked a friend of mine if he wants to share my Apple Music subscription or not and he replied saying ‚Äúgaane ke liye kaun pay karta hai bey‚Äù (Who the hell pays for songs?)NOTE: Some readers may feel offended after reading this but ask yourself whether I‚Äôm saying right or wrong. Also, I‚Äôm not pointing out everyone out there, there are people who are not indulged in piracy and they should be proud that they are supporting the creators by doing so. But the truth is that majority of us are indulged in piracy and most of them don‚Äôt even have an idea that it‚Äôs not legal and is a serious crime in itself.If you like my answer, kindly hit the upvote button and feel free to express your views in the comment section below. Hope I could be of some help to you!P.S. Excerpts taken from Mattias Petter Johansson‚Äôs answer to Why is Spotify not available in India?"

463,"As you sow, so shall you reap. This is one of the famous phrases used frequently.Literal meaning is, if you sow wheat then wheat will grow and wheat will be reaped not barely or rice.This phrase has a deep meaning and it revolves around the Karma, the deeds a person does. Anything you do has an outcome, it comes back to you in one or the other way. You can not escape the consequences of your actions. If you do good work, results will be good. If you do bad things in your life, you are going to get bad returns.What goes around comes around. Probably, Newton was also enlightened by this phrase and he derived the third law, ‚ÄúFor every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction,‚Äù but in real life reactions maybe more.If you take up any task with good intentions then the outcome will always be good. If your actions and intentions are bad then the results are going to fall in the bad directions.Watch your actionsImage source: Google"

467,"Here's an easy and approachable pizza recipe that will yield excellent results.¬† Follow it closely and you'll be able to make an amazing pizzeria quality pizza at home.¬† I've made over a thousand pizzas and this is the recipe I share with people because it doesn't require special oven or a mixer.¬†¬† All that's needed is a baking stone/steel and an inexpensive scale.¬† With the exception of the flour, which is really important (more on that below), it's pretty easy to find the ingredients at the supermarket.Note:¬† This answer focuses on making the dough.¬† The sauce, shaping and preparation are also very important but probably something that should be addressed in a separate question/answer.¬† Ingredients796 grams high gluten flour - Pendleton Power or General Mills All Trumps brand is what most pizzerias use.¬† See below.493 grams filtered water - Dasani, Aquafina or spring water is fine.1 teaspoon active dry yeast - Instant dry yeast or rapid rise yeast is fine if active dry yeast is unavailable. 2.5 teaspoons fine sea salt - Don't use coarse sea salt or table salt.1 teaspoon sugar - Plain old white sugar.1 teaspoon diastatic malt - If diastatic malt is unavailable, use 1/2 teaspoon of sugar, bringing the total amount of sugar to 1.5 teaspoons.1 tablespoon olive oil - Extra-virgin imparts too much flavor.¬† Use a plain olive oil.¬† About the IngredientsPizza making, and baking in general, is all about precision and attention to detail.¬† Everything makes a difference, and seemingly unimportant details, are important, so a few notes:Flour - The type of flour used is really, really important.¬† You can use what you have lying around, but it won't be nearly as good as using a high gluten flour.¬† If you go to an amazing New York style pizzeria, you'll probably find big bags of Pendletons Power or General Mills All Trumps in the kitchen.¬† You can also use King Arthur Sir Lancelot, but in my opinion, it's better suited for bread making.Water - It's not uncommon to hear people say that New York pizza is great because of the water.¬† This is a misleading statement.¬† Good water is a factor in pizza, but it isn't what makes pizza great.¬† You can't use bad water, but it just needs to be good enough.¬† Filtered water or spring water will do just fine if the tap water isn't good in your area.Yeast - Use active dry yeast if possible.¬† SAF or Red Star are great brands.¬† Trader Joe's will have these, so will some supermarkets.¬† If not, any brand will work.¬† Make sure it's not too old.Salt - For the most part, salt is salt.¬† Don't use table salt because it's too salty.¬† Don't use coarse salt because it might not dissolve properly. Diastatic Malt - Malt, if you have it, is an excellent browning and flavoring agent.¬† It's more subtle than sugar, but not required.¬† Preparing the DoughMeasure the ingredients - You'll notice we're using weight measurements (grams instead of cups).¬† A cup of flour can a significant variance. But 125 grams of flour is 125 grams of flour.¬† Whisk yeast and water - Add the yeast to the water and whisk for about 15-20 seconds.¬† The water should be lukewarm, about 85F, or warm to the touch.Mix flour and water/yeast mixture - Pour the water/yeast mixture into a large mixing bowl.¬† Add about 500 grams of the flour.¬† This doesn't need to be exact.¬† Using a wooden spoon, mix the flour/water mixture until it comes together.¬† It should take about 30 seconds for it to form into a batter-like consistency.Add the remaining ingredients - Add the remaining ingredients to the bowl:¬† salt, sugar, malt, olive oil and remaining flour.¬† With your hands, mix the dough for about 4-5 minutes.¬† You should end up with a nicely formed ball.¬† There shouldn't be any dough or ingredients sticking to the side of the bowl.Cover and Rest - Cover the bowl with a towel or some plastic wrap and set aside for 30 minutes.Knead and Ball - Grab the dough and give a quick knead (5-10 seconds).¬† You'll notice that the dough is much smoother than it was 30 minutes ago.¬† Using a dough cutter or a knife, divide the ball into 4 balls,¬† each 325 grams in weight.¬† A 325 gram ball will make a 13"" pizza.¬† This is a great video on balling dough:¬†¬† Refrigerate - Place each dough ball onto a tray or individual plastic bowls.¬† If using a tray, cover tightly with plastic wrap.¬† I prefer plastic bowls.¬† Coat the bowl with a tiny amount of oil.¬† This prevents sticking.¬† Next, place the dough in the refrigerator for 48 hours.Making The PizzaAfter 48 hours, the dough will be ready for shaping.¬† As mentioned previously, stretching the dough, making a sauce and topping the pie are worthy of their own posts, so I won't go into great detail here.¬† Here are some basic steps though:Preheat Oven - Place a stone or baking steel in the oven and preheat to 500F.¬† Allow the oven to warm up for an hour.¬† This is important.¬† 30 minutes, as most recipes call for, isn't enough. Remove dough from the refrigerator - Take the dough out of the refrigerator and allow it to warm up.¬† Place on the counter for an hour while the oven heats up.Shaping the Dough - Sprinkle some flour on a clean, dry countertop or surface.¬† Remove the dough from the container or tray and dunk it into a bowl of flour and shake off the excess flour.¬† Stretch the dough.¬† Here's a good video on shaping dough: Place on a Peel / Top - Once the dough is shaped, place it on a lightly floured pizza peel.¬† Add the sauce, cheese and toppings.¬† It's important to complete this step quickly to prevent the dough from sticking to the peel.¬† Give the peel a tap/shake every 15-20 seconds to keep it moving.¬† Bake - Slide the pizza from the peel onto the stone/baking steel.¬† Bake until done, most likely 8-12 minutes.¬† Each oven is different. There's a good chance the recipe will yield excellent results even on the first try.¬† If not, keep trying.¬† Technique is very important, and like most things, practice makes perfect."
468,"A2A,I've written about this before, but suffice to say that I have yet to find any evidence of Indian Mountaineering courses and institutes of providing anything other than techniques that were out of date in the 80s, and gear that is not suitable for mountaineering:What are some top institutes in India to get certified in mountaineering, skiing, rafting, kayaking, and paragliding?With that said this only matters if your goal is to learn how to bag peaks, and climb mountains independently. The majority of climbing in India focuses on the commercial climbing method, or siege style. They used aid climbing and fixed ropes to ascend all but the easiest terrain instead of technical skill and physical ability. So if you‚Äôre happy being a cog in a slightly unsafe machine, then Indian Mountaineering Instituites will provide you with excellent opportunities to help out other people on summits until you have risen up in the hierarchy.Here is why the course are terrible from the perspective of classical mountaineering and alpinism:Skills that critical to mountaineering (whiteout navigation, glacier travel, free climbing, proper rappel techniques) are absent, or undervalued on these courses in favour of fixed lines.Many of the techniques and equipment used on courses I have seen photographic evidence of are incredibly dangerous and would lead to serious legal consequences in other parts of the world.The fact this exists shows there is no oversight, or standards within Indian mountaineering. Instruction in safety techniques should ALWAYS have oversight from legitimate authorities. The lack of proper safety procedures reveals the whole system is brokenCalling this out led to outrage, and frustration towards myself, rather then the actually systems which were objectively incorrect according to every other international standard.I would strongly recommend against taking any course from anyone without IFMGA and UIAA accreditation. IFMGA and UIAA use scientific methods to test various techniques and practices. Nepal is the closest country with IFMGA certified guides: Nepal National Mountain Guides AssociationMajor skills are absent, or undervalued on these coursesThe courses do offer good comraderie, and a excellent chance to experience what a climbing expedition might look like in the Indian style.With that being said, I am biased by my western notions of mountaineering as a independent means of travel in hazardous environments that focus on small groups, onsight climbing and route finding, free climbing (gear and ropes, but ascent by purely physical rather than mechanical means), moving faster, and lighter.Mountaineering traditions in India were legitimate thirty years ago. Today they haven't evolved and are behind the rest of the world. The sole focus is on siege style methods, aid climbing, and ‚Äúattacking‚Äù and ‚Äúconquering‚Äù peaks with very large groups and any means necessary. Such style was rejected by European climbers in the fifties, though they kept the practice up in the Himalayas well into the 80s. Commercial expeditions too continue to follow this trend.But this style is rejected by guides, alpinists and mountaineers in the west, and southern America thanks to fancy lightweight gear, and leisure time to allow for skills and fitness training. there is also less social stigma for climberswho choose not to adhere to the norms of building families and careers. These options are not available to the average Indian, and to a certain extent one should make the best of what is available to them.But please review the answer I wrote. Some of the techniques taught have led to loss of life. I would highly recommend purchasing a UIAA recommended textbook like Mountaineering: The Freedom of the Hills, 8th Edition or Alpine Skills: Summer . Be critical of your instructors. Remember they are a self-certified organizations which means nothing. Trust these books over your instructors. These textbooks have been built on decades of learning from thousands of professionals using scientific methodology.Also, perhaps write to this program Arc'teryx Alpine Academy - Chamonix and tell them you are interested in bringing alpine style climbing to the growing market of Indian mountaineers. If you can convince Arc'teryx you could make money for them, perhaps they would sponsor you to go on the course."

Merely competing hypotheses. You are free to believe in any one of them until we prove one specific idea with observation and evidence.In the film, it's never really mentioned what data Cooper uncovers inside the black hole's singularity.

473,"Yes....you can...The road to becoming a pilot can be challenging, but the following is information about where to take your first steps and a basic idea of what is in store. There is a large amount of free information concerning certification, training and various things available straight from the FAAStep One:¬†¬† Obtain a First Class Medical CertificateA ""First Class"" medical is something that you'll need to maintain throughout your pilot career. I won't go into the particulars of the medical however I highly recommend obtaining one if you'd like to be an airline pilot. You can look in the yellow pages for ""Aeromedical Surgeon"" or call the local FSDO (Flight Standards District Office) for a listing of doctors that can examine you in your local area. Contrary to popular belief, you can wear glasses and still be an airline pilot as long as your vision is correctable to 20/20.Even if you cannot pass a class one medical, discover this early enough to weigh your options. There are circumstances in which you could apply for a medical flight waiver (even I had one of these for a period of time) and the earlier you begin this process, the better.Step Two:¬†¬† Private Pilot CertificateThis phase is approximately 40 hours of flying time in which you learn basic maneuvers, navigation skills, and some basic instrument skills.Step Three:¬†¬† Instrument RatingAfter you've built up some hours after your PPL, you begin to work on your instrument rating.¬†¬† Basically, you learn to fly the aircraft solely by reference to the instrument panel.¬† You do various instrument approaches and cross country flights in actual or simulated instrument conditions.Step Four:¬†¬† Commercial Certificate(s)The certification requires demonstration of advanced maneuvers and more precise flying skills than shown for the private pilot check ride.¬† You need at least 250 hours in order to qualify for this certificate. Also, many students will begin their multi-engine training in which you learn to fly a multi-engine aircraft -- usually a Beechcraft Duchess, Piper Seminole or Seneca. You will be responsible for demonstrating that you can do instrument approaches with both and only one engine operating.Step Five:¬† Time building!You can obtain your Certified Flight Instructor certificate in order to build flight time by instructing other student pilots, fly banner towing, friegh, aerial surveying, or whatever else you can do to build flight time. Some freshly certified commercial pilots are fortunate enough to be offered positions at a regional airline affiliated with the flight school at which they learned. Flying for a regional airline is critical because you fly advanced equipment into high density airports and hone the skills that major airlines are looking for in a new hire pilot.Step Six:¬† The Airline Transport Pilot CertificateYou can think of the ATP certificate as the ""Master's Degree of Flying"". You're eligible for this license when you have at least 1500 hours and meet some other requirements. Without an ATP, many major airlines really wouldn't want to consider your application until you do. I received my ATP during my initial captain upgrade training at Skyway Airlines a few years ago.FinallyApply. Apply. Apply.You may think that you're not ready for a job at a major, but unless you apply, they don't know you're out there. I'd even recommend apply to every major airline when you hit the 1000 hour mark. By the time you've earned your ATP, you've already built a history in the human resources file at the majors and be persistent.Anyone working for the majors would agree that this business is ""feast or famine"". Either no job offers are coming through or there is a FLOOD.Cheers...best of luck...!!!"
474,"Finding Lower Back Pain ReliefNearly everyone will experience some form of back pain in his or her lifetime. The low back is the area behind the belly from the rib cage to the pelvis and is also called the lumbar region. Back pain is a major cause of missed work. Low back pain usually resolves on its own and is commonly the result of a strain injury. There are many treatments for low back pain.At Risk for Lower Back Pain?Low back pain can start in a person's early twenties and continue on throughout adulthood. Studies have shown that up to 80% of the general population are affected by low back pain (LBP) at some time during their lives. Learn to prevent lower back pain by knowing what activities could be putting you at risk.Common Causes of Low Back PainManual materials handling (especially lifting)Twisting of the trunkBending the trunk forwardBending the trunk to the sideExcessive reachingFallsProlonged sittingSedentary jobsHighly physical jobsExposure to whole-body vibrationCigarette smokingObesityExtreme tallnessLow Back Pain Symptoms: Does Your Back Hurt?Low back pain symptoms range from sharp and stabbing to a dull ache. The pains can be constant or intermittent and positional. Acute low back pain can appear suddenly after injury. Chronic back pain is defined as pain lasting more than three months. Consult a doctor if you have prolonged back pain longer than 72 hours.Low Back Pain and Serious Back InjuriesSevere back pain after an injury should be evaluated by a health-care professional. Warning signs of more serious injury include pain with coughing or urinating, loss of control of the bowels or bladder, new leg weakness, and fever. These additional symptoms require medical evaluation.Is It Muscle Strain or Sciatica?Back pain that occurs after excessive exercise or heavy lifting is frequently a strain injury. However, occasionally these activities cause disc injury and rupture or herniation. When a herniated disc irritates the sciatic nerve, it can cause back pain.What is Sciatica?Sciatica is a form of nerve pain caused by pressure on the sciatic nerve. The sciatic nerve is a large nerve that runs down through the buttocks and extends down the back of the leg. Pressing on or pinching of the sciatic nerve causes shock-like or burning low back pain. Sometimes people feel as if the pain radiates down through the buttocks and down one leg, sometimes even reaching the foot.Is Your Job Causing Back Pain?A job that involves pulling, lifting, or twisting with the low back can cause injury and low back pain. Even prolonged sitting in an awkward position can cause low back pain. Standing on your feet for hours on end? That can cause lower back pain too. The best way to prevent back pain is to know if you are at risk.Jobs That Can Cause Lower Back PainAirline crew (pilots, baggage handlers)SurgeonsNurses & healthcare workersBus and cab driversWarehouse workersConstruction workersCarpet installers and cleanersFarmers (agricultural, dairy)Firefighters and policeJanitorsMechanicsOffice personnel (eg, telemarketers, file clerks, computer operators)Find Back Pain Relief: Lighten Your BagsCarrying an overstuffed purse, briefcase, or handbag can strain the low back. If you must carry a heavy load, consider using a wheeled briefcase instead. By reducing the amount of weight you're carrying, you reduce the amount of pressure on the spine. Help keep your kids' backs healthy by making sure their backpacks are not overloaded. A heavy backpack could mean future back pain for your little ones.Workouts That Can Cause Low Back PainMost athletic injuries to the back are sprains of the ligaments or strains of the muscles surrounding the spine. Serious conditions or complications can have similar symptoms to those of a routine sprain or strain. The most common sports injuries occur after repetitive overuse of the spine either through twisting, compr..."
475,"Hobbits: Excavations of a limestone cave on the Indonesia island of Flores uncovered a three-foot-tall skeleton with a skull one third the size of a normal human‚Äîa hobbit. Researchers discovered the bones of nine such people, the youngest of which dates back about 12,000 years. They also found tools and other signs of civilization. There are skeptics who believe the hobbits are simply humans that suffered from a growth inhibiting condition such as microcephaly, but the popular opinion among scientists is that the hobbits are a separate species like Neanderthals that shared a common ancestor with humans. Moby Dick & Captain Ahab: Not only was Moby Dick inspired by an actual giant white sperm whale, but the real one was infinitely more badass. He was named Mocha Dick, perhaps because he lived near the island of Mocha. He came off victorious against a hundred whaling ships, sending some in splinters to the bottom of the sea. He also took on three whaling ships at once and won.Captain Ahab was also inspired by a man living around the same time as Mocha Dick. Captain Pollard didn‚Äôt seek revenge after his ship was wrecked by a whale, forcing him and his crew to resort to cannibalism to survive, but he did go back out to sea as the captain of a new ship . . . that also was sunk‚Äîthis time by a storm.

476,"Yes we can, rapidly.Most of the people answering that it can‚Äôt, or that it would take hundreds or thousands of years are focusing mainly on emissions and not the other side of the carbon cycle. Even the few that acknowledged the other side of the carbon cycle, focused mainly on CCS and afforestation. Neither of which is up to the job. So I understand their concerns and don‚Äôt dispute their numbers, except they are missing something.Recent advancements in the biological sciences have discovered a biochemical pathway that we have been missing for well over 100 years. This is the way the biosphere naturally builds deep fertile soils and cools the planet.Cenozoic Expansion of Grasslands and Climatic CoolingEven though this is in the fossil record, the actual way the biosphere accomplished this really wasn‚Äôt completely known. We did know for over 100 years though that the best agricultural soils in the world were found under grasslands/savannas and/or open woodlands where the sun reached the understory of grasses. Those soils being so saturated with carbon they were black and fertile very deep despite no one ever fertilizing them.Mollic Epipedon - SpringerFor that reason these were the prime agricultural lands. And agriculture basically degrades them in almost every case.Land Degradation: An overviewOnly 60 Years of Farming Left If Soil Degradation ContinuesClimate and Land Degradation ‚Äî an OverviewSo the only known solution was simply to add fertilizers while still farming them, and when they degraded too far, let them go fallow. No one really knew how to farm without fertilisers and restore the soil naturally. Even most the organic farmers were heavily reliant on manure and compost inputs and fallow rotations to keep yields up. And lets face it, any solution to climate change involving soil carbon by necessity must equal or improve yields of food over green revolution industrialised agriculture. Lowering yields with our current growing population just won‚Äôt work. There just isn‚Äôt enough land left because most the land suitable for agriculture already is in agriculture.Farming Claims Almost Half Earth's Land, New Maps ShowIf we started degrading what is left we would basically leave no room at all for any wildlife!

It‚Äôs still unrecognised by the accepted mainstream, but with recent advancements in biological sciences and agricultural methods, it can no longer be called impossible. For the first time in human history we know how to restore degraded land while continuously improving agricultural yields at the same time! And low and behold, it just so happens it involves the other side of the carbon cycle! Coincidence?Currently the atmosphere and ocean have too much carbon while soils have lost carbon at an alarming rate due to development, conversion of native grasslands and forests to cropland, and agricultural practices that decrease soil organic matter.-Daniel KaneTurns out there is more carbon missing from our soils worldwide than the additional carbon in the atmosphere since the beginning of the industrial age. That means almost accidently, those stubborn scientists and farmers that found out how to solve the agricultural dilemma, actually figured out how to solve AGW too. Solve one, you solve both. There are still a few minor gaps with certain crops. But the principle is sound and the gaps are small enough that they don‚Äôt prevent action or end result. We still need to reduce emissions by converting to ..."

478,"Gravity exists everywhere. Its strength depends on mass, so on a small planetoid like the Moon it‚Äôs only 1/6 of its value on Earth.I see most people refer to it as a force. My physics professor was always very careful to avoid calling it any such thing, and taught us always to refer to it as ‚Äúthe acceleration due to gravity‚Äù, which in fact is what it is. An acceleration. How can this be, I hear you ask, when gravity is experienced by stationary objects. Well - there are no stationary objects in our 4 dimensional Universe. Everything is moving in the direction time at the speed of light, according to Einstein. So when we find ourselves in the presence of mass, which distorts space-time, we‚Äôre obliged to follow a curved path, and the effect we feel is what is commonly called ‚Äúcentrifugal force‚Äù. It‚Äôs not actually a force - it‚Äôs an inertial effect.

Diet is the key factor when it comes to losing weight, so get the grip of the most significant factor first.Next up, you can start following a workout routine, by workout routine it doesn‚Äôt mean you start lifting heavy weights, weight lifting is also a wise idea but just to get the ball rolling, take a start with some cardio exercises such as running, jogging, sprinting or swimming. With the course of time you can add on different exercises as it will only do good and no harm.Sleep is also very important in order to keep your body healthy and active. Once you are on the verge of weight loss, you need to make sure that you are doing every possible thing to keep your body as active as possible because you would need some extra energy to perform workout and other daily routine activities. Take sufficient amount of sleep at least 6 to 8 hours daily.Water intake must be consistent. Consume as much amount of water as possible. Water have 0 calories, so it won‚Äôt harm in any way instead consumption of water in good amount will aid in weight loss as it will keep the body detoxified and hydrated.If you can manage sometime of your daily routine, try practicing some other well renowned techniques such as meditation and yoga.So you see things are fairly simple but certainly requires some dedication and consistency.

A person can‚Äôt by law, put flashing red or blue lights on their personal vehicle for this reason. This is why you see yellow (the next most visible color) on Tow Trucks etc, or anyone who has a vehicle for business etc that needs extra visibility in traffic.The wavelengths of the colors etc were not taken into consideration when deciding what colors to use..just convention and tradition. There are different local conventions as well. For example for years the Michigan State Police only used 1 solitary Red light on all of their police vehicles. They still have the one red light but it is supplemented with additional light bars for safety today. Where I was a Fireman in Edwardsville Illinois the Fire used Red and white and the Police used Blue and White light bars."

487,"It's generally a term meaning that the value in that variable doesn't have some sort of planned meaning. I.e. when the variable was declared (i.e. the compiled program allocated space in RAM to hold a value for that variable) nothing was placed there. So whatever was previously in that spot in RAM is now the value.Something like this:#include <stdio.h>int main(void) {	int my_int;	my_int = my_int + 1000;	printf(""%d"", my_int);	return 0;}Just what is in that my_int variable? It might be 0, then again it might be a portion of a string which was in the html of the web page you last viewed, or it could be a set of bytes from a program which was last executed, or anything which was previously in that spot in RAM. The C compiler (usually) just builds a program which takes the raw bits in that spot and interprets them as an integer (because of the int type specifier), it doesn't clear anything, it doesn't set anything, it only allocates the RAM which was free before it ran.This is also referred to (more correctly) as non-initialized values. Because the most common way to avoid this is to initialize a variable with a value when declaring it. Or at least set it to something prior to making use of its value. I.e. rather than leaving it as is, you'd do something like this:#include int main(void) {	int my_int = 0;	my_int = my_int + 1000;	printf(""%d"", my_int);	return 0;}At least now you ""know"" that the value starts off as 0.Similar stuff happens with other types of variables. E.g. an array of ints is also such non-initialized values. Worse, a variable as a pointer means it may very easily point to somewhere which is impossible (e.g. beyond the available RAM). So in nearly all cases it's a very good idea to initialize your variables as soon as possible, you may leave it till a bit later in some very select cases where you want to optimize, but there's extremely few cases where you'd never initialize.You can set some command switches in some C compilers which would auto-initialize such variables for you, but you should not need to rely on that. Some other languages guarantee that they auto-initialize to some default values (usually 0), but C is not one of them."

491,"Asteriods and Comets are both celestial bodies orbiting the Sun. The main difference between the two is their composition, i.e, the stuff they are made of. An asteroid is made of rocky material and metals, where as a comet is made of ice, dust and small rocks.Asteriods are formed much closer to the Sun. The temperature around the Sun makes it too warm for ice to remain solid.Whereas comets are formed farther from the Sun where ice won‚Äôt melt.Asteroids typically remain much more solid and self-contained, even when near the Sun.Comets, while approaching the Sun, lose material with each orbit because some of their ice melts and vaporizes to form a tail, which asteroids don‚Äôt have.Another difference between comets and asteroids are the path they take or orbital patterns. Comets tend to have extended and elongated orbits, many times going more than 50,000 AU from the sun (1 AU, or astronomical unit, equals the distance from the Earth to the Sun). Asteroids tend to have shorter, more circular orbits and group together in belts than comets.Comet.Asteroid"
492,"Why do you believe it is?At least, in my experience, the belief is usually the opposite: if milk is seen to be left out unrefrigerated and has reached ambient temperature, it is usually thrown away as dangerous.Within certain extremes, the temperature of milk doesn‚Äôt change how good or bad it is for you. Warm, cold, room temperature milk is all the same ‚Äî until you take bacteria into account.All milk is contaminated with bacteria, some of which is harmful, and milk makes an effective growth medium for bacteria. Raw (unpasteurized) milk can have varying levels of contamination, and may in many cases be safe to drink ‚Äî but in some cases can be deadly. Pasteurization kills most, but not all, of the bacterial contamination, with ‚Äúultra high pasteurization‚Äù (UHP) being better at it than regular pasteurization.Refrigeration slows down bacterial growth, and prolongs the time it takes for bacterial grown to become harmful. Without refrigeration, bacteria can grow to unsafe levels within a couple of days, and can start to cause changes to the milk in a few hours, especially in raw milk.This is used in traditional butter and cheesemaking, as the byproducts of the bacterial growth help transform the milk into these products. In modern cheesemaking, the same results are achieved by inoculating pasteurized milk with the desired bacterial cultures rather than using the natural ones in the milk.UHP milk, if still sealed, has low enough starting concentrations of bacteria that it can last for months at room temperature. But as soon as it is opened, it will get infected by airborne bacteria and start to turn."

497,"New space ‚Äòemanates‚Äô from all massive particles at the speed of light. What we see as a constant value, c, exists as a constant because photons exist in a state(s) allowing them to travel on the expanding wave front of space/time from all massive particles, synchronized across the universe by the ‚Äòcreative‚Äô phenomenon we name the ‚ÄòBig Bang‚Äô. [e.g. When a photon is emanated by the sun, it expands on the wave front of the sun‚Äôs space/time emanations. When it reflects off of the moon, it is expanding on the wave front of the moon‚Äôs mass. When it is created by an explosion of mass / energy (equivalent, essentially) and reflects off a tiny particle, it moves on the wave front of this mass‚Äôs emanations and then the tiny particle‚Äôs emanations.]The source of this space/time emanation is temporal in nature. The crux of the explanation is that the big bang is not a distinct event that created the universe, but instead a continuously occurring and simultaneous phenomenon. The energy (infinite by our standards or nothing could exist), released in the big bang is continuously/simultaneously restructuring itself into the infinite pantheon of everything that exists in momentary memory.Instead of an answer, I have posed a possible solution, because nobody really knows the correct answer to this. I have been looking for the answer to this and a few other questions (such as why does gravity exist and what is its nature?) for nearly two decades with no answers forthcoming that do not make fundamental assumptions that something simply is, and has to be because the equation doesn‚Äôt make sense otherwise.Exploring this is imperative for our understanding of physics to advance in a major way. It is my belief that our understanding of multiple dimensions would be flipped upside down by a more accurate theory with which to frame this question that accounts for dynamic dimensional flow instead of simply various dimensional geometries. None of the answers have truly addressed this, and the Higgs Boson solution or other quantum explanations may be the closest model approximations we have yet conceptualized that are accepted by mainstream physics. My belief is that this is tied intricately into the question, where does gravity come from and why does it draw masses together (a wave-like cancellation of the ‚Äòexpanding‚Äô space/time wave front between two masses that is ‚Äòstronger‚Äô as the masses draw closer or are more massive)? Also, why is there a maximum light speed? Or, rather, why do particles get more massive as they accelerate towards light speed?"

If anyone in your family upto 4 generations on mothers or fathers side, then chances are that you will get baldness too.Male pattern baldness starts at the front on angles of hairline and in crown area. It slowly spreads to make the entire top of head bald.Prevention of baldness can be done in early stages of hair loss by regular use of minoxidil and finasteride.If the baldness is in very early stages with presence of small baby hair on head then hair regrowth therapy may work. It includes a combination of medicines and PRP therapy. Remember hair regrowth therapy is not a pne time procedure. It needs to taken continuously indefinitely. Despite regular use, regrowth is not guaranteed.But if baldness is in advanced stages then hair regrowth therapy may not work. Hair transplant remains the only natural and permanent option here. Hair transplant treatment includes taking hair from the back of head or beard or other parts of body and implanting them at bald areas. Sonce it is your own hair, they will remain lifelong and do not require long term of maintenance. It is a completely safe procedure. It helps in changing the looks of a person completely. Nowadays the technology is very advanced and hair transplant is possible without visible scarring.Other ways of treating baldness are artificial biofibres hair implant, scalp micropigmentation or wigs and hair bonding.

499,"Being Chinese, once I interviewed my Japanese coworkers who work in China,‚ÄúWhat Chinese cuisine do you DISLIKE the most?‚ÄùI asked this question because all of them have been constantly telling me they love love love Chinese food. When I asked them which cuisine is their favorite, they gave me an unbelievable long list. But, the thing is, 99.99999% Japanese people are freakishly polite, especially when they are your coworkers (which means, you can easily know what they like, but you can hardly know what they dislike). So I was deadly eager to hear their real voice.From 20+ coworkers, I got a ‚ÄòThe Worst Chinese Cuisine For Japanese‚Äô rank. And the No.1 totally shocked me.The steamed freshwater fish.There are lots of ways to cook fish in China. And steaming is commonly considered as the most authentic way, because you only put the scallion and ginger slice, light soy sauce in, steam shortly, without heavy cooking, to keep the original flavor of the fish as possible. It also means you can only make this dish with 100% fresh fish. In inland regions, people usually use freshwater fish to cook it because those are fish they can buy living from the tanks of morning markets or supermarkets. It‚Äôs also a gorgeous and expensive cuisine in high-end restaurants. Generous Chinese hosts like to order it for their VIP guests.But my coworkers hated it, despite that they tried hard to pretend to enjoy it for politeness.The reason?The fishy taste of ‚Äòfreshwater fish‚Äô. Most Japanese people eat mostly sea fish, hence their tongues are unfamiliar with the taste of freshwater fish, hence ‚Äòfishy‚Äô. (Likewise, lots of my inland Chinese relatives who are rarely exposed to seafood say sea fish tastes ‚Äòfishy‚Äô.) Some of my Japanese coworkers got shocked by knowing carp is a common dish too in China which they considered as ‚Äòinedible‚Äô.Too many bones. ‚ÄòPutting something into your mouth then spitting part of it out‚Äô is considered a no-no in Japanese table manner. So most cuisines in Japan are prepared bone-less. In the case bones are unavoidable, they tend to use the sharp chopstick tips to neatly remove the bones before putting into their mouths. There is no such a table manner in China. In a typical Chinese restaurant, a small plate is placed in front of each person. People freely spit out bones, nut shells, fruit seeds etc onto them. Waiters frequently replace them with clean plates. Most steamed freshwater fish have far too many bones to remove by chopsticks. This is a typical Chinese cuisine which is designed to ‚Äòuse your mouth and achieve your food‚Äô, which, apparently became ‚Äòa pain in the ass‚Äô to my poor coworkers who grew up in another food culture.‚ÄòI just can‚Äôt stand making eye contact with a fish to be eaten.‚Äô Well, enough said.(Side note: Interestingly, 100% of my Japanese coworkers fell in love with Yangcheng hairy crabs, or in Japanese language, ‚ÄòShanghai crab‚Äô, despite the facts they are from freshwater, they have countless bones which costs you a great effort to remove by mouth, and, their tiny eyes occasionally make contact with you too‚Ä¶)Lots of ‚Äòweird food‚Äô are on the rank, such as duck‚Äôs tongues. Apparently my coworkers are not particularly into French kissing ducks.Frogs.Snakes.They don‚Äôt hate the taste. They hate the awareness they know what they are eating- things which are considered ‚Äòinedible‚Äô in their culture.Different food cultures not only make ‚Äòdislikes‚Äô, they make ‚Äòlikes‚Äô too.My Japanese coworkers have a consensus:The best beef is in Japan. The best pork is in China.They make love with different, creative and diverse Chinese pork cuisines.Braised pork with brown sauce is one of their ‚Äòmust order dishes‚Äô.Sometimes Japanese coworkers who are karato (spicy food lovers) would suggest to eat hot hot Hunan cuisine. And every time, the first disappeared cuisine is this one- West Hunan chili fried pork.And their favorite Shanghai dim sum is ..."

Given a homework assignment, complete it early and you can relax ‚Äî enjoy yourself. ‚ÄúYou earned it.‚Äù Day after day, university, college, or boot camp, they were given a list to complete and they showed their vocational ability to check off the task.

Average programmers are given requirements and they jump directly into implementation. A kind of muscle memory from months and years of programming education.An amazing programmer will take ‚Äúrequirements‚Äù, think about them, shadow the users, do it themselves, and apply everything they have learned while living a day in the life of someone else and ask:What am I really trying to solve?How effective are the requirements I am given?How can I add or change the requirements to be even more effective?Who gave me these requirements, maybe they are not accurate?How do I get accurate requirements?What‚Äôs the real improvement goals, is it measurable? Specific?The fact is, everyone has perspectives based on their own views of the problem. Programmers will look at it differently. Users will too. Even managers. If we blindly accept requirements, then we are putting trust into those ideas. If we do not mentally simulate and even physically simulate, than we might not get the whole story.A massively great skill to have as a programmer, is to be willing and able to live a day of the life of someone else‚Ä¶ to know their hardships, their inefficiencies, their annoyances, and their real issues. This skill gives programmers the ability to do more, be more, and excellerate faster."

504,"I don't know what life is like as a whistleblower anywhere else, but I can tell you quite a bit about what my life as a bank whistleblower living in the United States has been like...When I left Bank of America, they went on an immediate smear campaign against me I was not prepared for, with their corporate security team calling the Chandler, AZ police department to report a bomb threat on my facebook page. In my blog, The Night My Whole Life Changed... I described what happened the night the police surrounded my house in front of all my neighbors and accused me of calling in a bomb threat.I was calm and intelligent enough to stay out of jail, but I had been effectively blacklisted, and while I filled out paperwork to obtain unemployment and other government assistance, the bank was hard at work sending adjusted income forms to the IRS and collecting any and all information they could on me.The only reason I was able to survive any of this long enough to speak to a regulator (at the time, the State Attorneys General Coalition, who was pursuing the largest bank settlement to come out of the housing crisis) is because I went public via Anonymous and the internet. If not for Anonymous and the internet, I would be dead like the countless other whistleblowers who make ""Whistleblower found dead"" the top auto-fill suggestion on Google.Not only did speaking to the Attorneys General Coalition not affect anything, but I found myself with nothing. Nearly everyone around me cut me off as I was no longer climbing the ladder with them; I was now labeled a problem...a snitch...a whistleblower...It was while laying on rock bottom, on the precipice of overdosing on spice (synthetic marijuana that was ironically legal in AZ at the time), losing my house, my car, and my entire world that I pondered how this could happen to a man whose only crime was in telling the truth. I realized for every Bradley Manning we hear about, there are thousands who were silenced. That's the thought that led to me building my blog and becoming a writer.As a free man who blew the whistle on a civilian corporation in the United States (the supposed beacon of human freedom), I would say the only safe place to seek asylum is on the internet...that's where I've been hiding...Brian Penny"

And because these events are a little more uncommon than even the media cares for, they eagerly and uncritically jump to the first relief coming their way: a normal human being taking responsibility. Great, we can go back to sleep! But Sherlock isn‚Äôt that easily satisfied with shallow claims.This mandala appeared 1990 carved in the hard bottom of a desert lake in Oregon and comprised a total of 13 miles of 10‚Ä≥ wide furrows dug 3‚Ä≥deep.

507,"Zika Virus (ZIKV) is mosquito-borne emerging flavivirus which was first identified in Zika Forest of Uganda in 1947 in rhesus monkeys. It was later identified in humans in 1968 for the first time in Nigeria. Different outbreaks of Zika virus disease have been recorded in Africa, the Americas, Asia and the Pacific. Its infection is caused by the bite of an infected Aedes mosquito, usually causing mild fever, rash, conjunctivitis, and muscle pain. In Brazil in May 2015, the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) issued an alert regarding the first confirmed Zika virus infections.Group: Group IV ((+) ssRNA)Family: FlaviviridaeGenus: FlavivirusSpecies: Zika virusStructure of Zika Virus :-The virion is approximately 40 nm in diameter with surface projections that measure roughly 5-10 nm.Nucleocapsid is 25-30 nm in diameter surrounded by a host-membrane derived lipid bilayer.EnvelopedIcosahedralContains envelope proteins E and MGenome of Zika virus :-Non-segmented, single-stranded, positive-sense RNA genome10794 bases long with two non-coding regions flanking regions known as the 5‚Ä≤ NCR and the 3‚Ä≤ NCR.Sign and Symptoms of Zika Virus :-These symptoms are mild and usually last for 2-7 days.HeadacheFeverSkin rashes (exanthema)Pink eyeConjunctivitisMuscle and joint painMalaiseSymptoms are similar to that of dengue or chikungunya.Epidemiology of Zika virus :-The virus was first isolated in 1947 from a rhesus macaque in the Zika Forest of Uganda.It was later identified in humans in 1968 for the first time in NigeriaThe first major outbreak, with 185 confirmed cases, was reported in 2007 in the Yap Islands.The first cases confirmed in Brazil was in May 2015 and the country is currently experiencing the largest epidemic ever recorded with 440,000 to 1,300,000 suspected cases reported by the Brazilian health authorities.There are 3174 cases and 38 deaths from microcephaly in Brazil as of 21 October 2015.There has been total death of 152 as of 21 October 2015 in the world.Affected Countries: Barbados, Bolivia, Brazil, Colombia, the Dominican Republic, Ecuador, El Salvador, French Guiana, Guatemala, Guadeloupe, Guyana, Haiti, Honduras, Martinique, Mexico, Panama, Paraguay, Puerto Rico, Saint Martin, Suriname, and Venezuela.Countries and territories with active Zika virus transmission as of Jan 2016.Source: CDCSince November, Brazil has seen nearly 4,000 cases of microcephaly in babies born to women who were infected with Zika during their pregnancies.Transmission of Zika virus :-Zika virus is transmitted from one people to another through the bite of an infected Aedes mosquito, mainly Aedes aegypti in tropical regions.There has been one report of possible spread of the virus through blood transfusion and one report of possible spread of the virus through sexual contact.In 2015, Zika virus RNA was detected in the amniotic fluid of two fetuses, indicating that it had crossed the placenta and could cause a mother-to-child infection.The Asian tiger mosquito, Aedes albopictus, is also known to transmit the virus, but it is not clear how efficiently.To date, there are no reports of infants getting Zika virus through breastfeeding.Pathogenesis of Zika Virus :-Incubation period in mosquitoes is about 10 days.The vertebrate hosts of the virus are primarily monkeys and humans.The pathogenesis of the virus is hypothesized to start with an infection of dendritic cells near the site of inoculation, followed by a spread to lymph nodes and the bloodstream. Flaviviruses generally replicate in the cytoplasm, but Zika virus antigens have been found in infected cell nuclei.Infection with the virus appears to be linked to the development of unusually small heads and brain damage in newborns (microcephaly). The most dangerous time is thought to be during the first trimester of Pregnancy‚Äì when some women do not realize they are pregnant. Experts do not know how the virus enters the placenta and damages the growing brain of the fetus.Diagnosis of Zika Virus:-Sample: Blood, Saliva, Urine.PCR: It is useful in the first 3-5 days after the onset of symptoms. It helps in the direct detection of Zika virus RNA or specific viral antigens in clinical specimens.Serology Test: It detect the presence of antibodies but are useful only after five days.Treatment of Zika Virus:-There is no specific treatment or vaccine currently available.Prevention and Control of Zika Virus:-Avoid travel to areas with an active infestation.Travelers should take the basic precautions to protect themselves from mosquito bites.During outbreaks, health authorities may advise that spraying of insecticides be carried out.Reducing mosquito populations and avoiding bites, which occur mainly during the day.Eliminating and controlling Aedes aegypti mosquito breeding sites reduces the chances that Zika will be transmitted.References:-Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)- Zika Virus.WHO, Media Centre, Fact sheets- Zika virus.Pan American Health Organization- Zika Virus Infection.CNN- Five things you need to know about Zika.CBC Radio Canada- Zika virus: what you need to know.Guardian News and Media Limited- Zika virus: what travellers need to know.The New York Times Company- Short Answers to Hard Questions About Zika Virus.Vox Media, Inc.- Zika virus, explained in 6 charts and maps.Microbeonline- Zika virus: Transmission, Pathogenesis, symptoms and laboratory diagnosis.Wikipedia- Zika virus."

If your book is a website, you have to be very disciplined to not switch to some other site just for a few seconds to check in on something.You can watch videos if you want, and if you feel they‚Äôre helpful. But one thing is certain: you will never learn algebra 1 if you don‚Äôt do exercises. Ideally, lots of them.The good news is, you can do this in a short time. You can stop reading now if you like, but I‚Äôll finish up with a little story from my education:I switched schools in 8th grade. Unbeknownst to me, the book I used in the first school was basically in the reverse order of the book I used at the next one. That meant I saw half of algebra 1 twice, and didn‚Äôt see the other half at all. Worse yet, I didn‚Äôt discover this until the final exam: I had no idea about half the stuff. So I got an F in the class.This was scary for me because (a) I knew I wasn‚Äôt an F student, and (b) the F meant I‚Äôd be placed into ‚Äúmath for dummies‚Äù next year. Fortunately, the F came in 8th grade. (For international readers: US colleges only look at your academic record from 9th grade on. So this F wouldn‚Äôt hurt me in that way.)In any case, I explained the situation to the 9th grade school administration, and somehow managed to get placed in the advanced math class on the condition I get up to speed on algebra by myself.So I did what I suggested above: over the summer, I worked through the first part of my algebra book. Sometimes I sat down for hours at a time, sometimes just 15‚Äì20 minutes a day. But I was relentless.If you can do that, you can learn algebra. In fact, you can learn a lot more."

511,"The battle of Agincourt happened because Henry V had a tougher time of it at Harfleur than he anticipated due to dysentery in his siege camp. It was late in the year and he needed to find someplace to overwinter. Rather than get on a boat and retreat to England he decided to take his army to English held Calais. And he took them overland rather than use his invasion fleet to hop round the coast as it had been dispersed back to EnglandThe French army that had been raised to relieve Harfleur marched to intercept him. I don‚Äôt know why the French were so tardy and didn‚Äôt make it to Harfleur in time to save the town, Henry was there for a month.Henry failed to evade the French and had to take them on with his experienced army tired and in poor health, but his skillful use of the terrain meant that he bogged the French men at arms down in the mud and surrounded them on three sides.Edgehill was completely different, and I don‚Äôt know why you are trying to compare them. Both sides had secure supply lines, both were very new armies and had plenty of untried troops and some materials were in short supply.Charles had far more freedom of choice than Henry, he could have taken his army anywhere, he was in no way forced along the road to London, he took it because he wanted the war over quickly. He knew Essex would intervene, Parliament had to keep London, and he thought he would beat them. Essex‚Äôs position also in no way resembled Henry‚Äôs, he had a well supplied army, he didn‚Äôt know where the King was (unlike the French and English armies in the Agincourt campaign who were dogging each other‚Äôs footsteps most on the way), and he was on his way to relive the besieged town of Banbury when his scouts ran into the King‚Äôs scouts. Edgehill was an accident, not a long anticipated confrontation after a couple of weeks of chasing around.The battle used cavalry as actual cavalry; at Agincourt the French had mounted troops but they just charged straight at the English defensive position and got mown down. Terrain advantage lay with the Royalists as they had a ridge to deploy on, but they made no attempt to close down the front to a narrow defile. Outflanking was done loudly and obviously by cavalry, not by concealed missile troops and conventionally Parliament countered with their own cavalry, though ineffectually.Parliament‚Äôs army wavered as their cavalry was swept away and the Royalists advanced to meet them - Henry stuck to his position. What stopped Charles winning the battle was the fact that his cavalry were too busy chasing routed Parliamentarian cavalry and looting their camp, Parliament still had a few in reserve and they helped their infantry beat back the Royalist infantry and even managed to menace the King‚Äôs sons by breaking through Royalist lines. However with most of their cavalry gone the Parliamentarians couldn‚Äôt make enough of this advantage and when some of the Royalist cavalry eventually returned to the fray they withdrew.The battle ended as a draw - while Agincourt was a fairly decisive win - both sides retreating to their camps leaving a rearguard to take pot shots at each other and neither willing to have another go the following day. Charles went on to take a few towns along the Thames Valley to secure supply lines, while Essex returned directly to London and when he met the king‚Äôs army again at Turnham Green had more than enough men to hold the Royalists back.The only resemblance between the two was that a cavalry unit got detached from the fray to loot a camp and baggage train. But at Agincourt this seems to have happened at the end of the battle when the French had already been mauled enough to withdraw and did not affect the outcome."

As we understand that, day by day newer apps and software versions requires more memory and faster processor.Inshort waiting for newer model worth the wait and will be beneficial for your upcoming task for next few years - although the current macbook will do the tasks as well but newer is better.There are other reasons as well. Since past few years apple is constructing macbooks with non upgradeable memory feature (memories are soldered on board)Buying a newer model will give you the opportunity to get more RAM at faster bus speed (again benifical for your future use)The only reason to buy the current macbook is if you need it urgently in few days or by next month.The price will not be much higher when they launched new model and on the other hand the price will drop instantly on current model. Why invest on the item which we know will be less worth as soon as newer model come in market (which is expecting soon) think for a mement about what will be the re-sale value of your expensive machine in just next two yearsNewer is betterCheers hope this helpsRegards"
516,"Hell, Yes.Assuming the binge drinker lives a long time, because binge drinking can cause immediate brain and body damage.Read about it here: Binge drinking - Wikipedia‚ÄúBinge drinking causes brain damage faster and more severely than chronic drinking (alcoholism). The neurotoxic insults are due to very large amounts of glutamate which are released and over-stimulate the brain as a binge finishes. This results in excitotoxicity, a process which damages or kills neurons (brain cells).[8] Each binge drinking episode immediately insults the brain; repeat episodes result in accumulating harm. The developing adolescent brain is thought to be particularly susceptible to the neurotoxic effects of binge drinking, with some evidence of brain damage occurring from drinking more than 10 or 11 drinks once or twice per month.[9]‚ÄùOf course, immediate, total destruction of the brain by binge drinking is common. Typically, this results from motor vehicle accidents or wandering where one shouldn't, but the Darwin Awards list many of the more creative ways drunkards have offed themselves.Further info can be found here: CDC - Fact Sheets-Binge Drinking - AlcoholOr look it up yourself, google: ‚Äúhealth effects of binge drinking.‚Äù"
517,"As an anecdote, I was conversing with a Chinese-American Evangelist who stated that Christianity was persecuted and repressed within mainland China. However, I didn‚Äôt agree because Christians were not singled out for harsher treatment from society and politics. When we both attempted to explain our positions, he argued that the CCP was a dictatorship which should be overthrown to deliver social and religious freedom. Although I agreed that the Communist Party was often heavy-handed, I was appalled by his willingness to dismantle the existing order (rather than attempting to work within the system) for reform, which could throw China ‚Äúinto another bloody civil war‚Äù or enable foreign powers ‚Äúto reimpose unequal treaties‚Äù.In retrospect, I believe that roots of our disagreement stem from Confucianism and Christianity, which believes that original sin is inherited as an act of turning away from God, who empowers an individual‚Äôs free will by granting them the choice to establish a personal, heartfelt relationship with Him. This contrasts with a Confucian assertion that people are born inherently good, but chose to become evil after performing behavior that harmed them and society. I thus attempted to revolve my personal habits and lifestyle around a collectivist viewpoint that idealized ‚Äústability and harmony‚Äù on earth, but not heaven.As a result, a Confucian does not consider him/herself to take priority over other people and the nation-state. Their social roles remain more or less unspoken, so individuals and the CCP expected each other to follow tacitly agreed-upon limits until very recently. If citizens did not oppose the government, they were ignored and allowed to gain wealth. The political reformers were also satisfied, because it was possible for potential (albeit gradual) reform in the government. The modern centralized administration arose from warlord-ruled provinces that reunified in a life-and-death struggle against a shared enemy during the Second Sino-Japanese War (1937‚Äì1945), despite their cultural, ethnic, and geographic divisions. Despite this, Confucianism is ultimately responsible for creating and actively enforcing a ‚Äútyranny of the majority‚Äù because an individual‚Äôs rights are carefully controlled by the government and society. Although rulers attempt to gain their legitimacy by catering to public opinion, this can easily silence dissent: ‚Äúthe nail that sticks up is hammered down‚Äù. (Âá∫„ÇãÈáò„ÅØÊâì„Åü„Çå„Çã)Similar themes can be found in Squirrel and Hedgehog, when the spy from Flower Hill sent a warning with his own blood.Unlike Christianity‚Äôs assertion of an Absolute Truth and divine intervention in human affairs, Confucius told his followers to ‚Äúrespect ghosts and spirits, but keep them at a distance.‚Äù Instead of turning to God, I looked toward the past to discern cultural and historical patterns which could explain this authoritarian leadership: In short, the overthrow of a dynasty was a power grab (not a quest for liberty) under a new emperor, whose own descendants were toppled after they became unresponsive to the welfare of the population or lost control of China‚Äôs internal and external affairs. This cycle continued for 4000 years, opening the door for bloodshed, famine, national division, and foreign invasion without any long-lasting changes. The U.S. Constitution, however, was based upon the idea of God-given rights (‚ÄúWe hold these truths to be self-evident and that all men are created equal‚Äù), creating a highly flawed, but self-correcting democracy with active civic participation among well-educated and propertied white males in 1791."

Whenever a visitor standing outside the door presses the doorbell button, the wireless panel sends a signal from outside the house which is received by the doorbell inside and lets you know who is at the door through its camera and can even communicate without even opening the door.For more information click here- Smart Home"
520,"I take Spirulina daily 3 grams AM and 3 grams PM and I have been doing this for many years. I have noticed my health is more balanced and easier to maintain since I have been taking it. NASA even say you could survive on it alone.Here are some bits from various sources including the Diet DiaryDiet Diary: Astronauts‚Äô meal ‚Äî Power-food for earthlingsSpirulina, an ancient staple food of the Azetacs and Mesoamericans, is now available as a food supplement at health food storesSpirulina, a blue-green algae that is available in the form of powder, capsule and tonic, can help regulate blood sugar, blood pressure and cholesterolSpirulina, an ancient staple food of the Azetacs and Mesoamericans, is now available as a food supplement at health food stores. The blue-green algae shot to fame in the 1970s when National Aeronautical and Space Agency (NASA), USA, used it for astronauts food in space Spirulina is rich in proteins (60%), amino acids, essential fatty acids, Gamma-linolenic acid (GLA) fatty acids, nucleic acids (DNA and RNA), beta-carotene (pro-vitamin A), vitamins- B, C & E, minerals like iron, potassium, magnesium, sodium, phosphorus and calcium, and phytochemicals such as chlorophyll (the green pigment) and phycocyanin (a blue pigment). Its outstanding nutritional profile, high protein and low calorie count makes it a ‚Äòsuperfood‚Äô.Centuries ago, the Aztecs and the Mayas realised the healing properties of spirulina and enjoyed this source of vegetable nutrition as a ‚Äòpower-food‚Äô to boost their energy levels and enhance stamina.Recent scientific research has revealed numerous health benefits of this ‚Äòsuper-food‚Äô. Spirulina has been shown to help regulate blood sugar, blood pressure and cholesterol, alleviate pain, inflammation and allergies, balance the immune system, improve digestion by increasing good gut flora and deliver antioxidant activity to protect from life-threatening diseases like cancer, Alzheimers and strokes.It has also been shown to suppress appetite and help weight watchers. Its high beta-carotene content helps maintain good skin and hair.A study conducted at the JC Bose Institute of Life Sciences, Bundelkhand University, Jhansi, published in ‚ÄòCurrent Pharmaceutical Biotechnology‚Äô in 2005, reported that spirulina improves the activity of white blood cells, stimulates antibodies and increases the population of natural killer cells.Spirulina‚Äôs concentrated nutrition makes it an ideal food supplement for people of all ages and lifestyles, fussy eaters and especially those who do not manage to eat adequate amount of vegetables. However, pregnant and lactating women and people allergic to seafood or seaweed must consult their physician.Tropical weather, strong sunshine, pure water resource and pollution-free environment is all what Spirulina needs for its cultivation. However, if water is polluted or contaminated with heavy metals, it is not suitable for spirulina cultivation as these metals and toxins will get highly concentrated in spirulina and make it unsuitable for human consumption. Hence, the source and purity of spirulina is critical.Commercially, Spirulina is available in the form of powder, tablet, capsule and health tonic. It can be added to soups, pastas, fruits, vegetables, salads, pulses and lentils. Being high on nutrition and easy on digestion, it certainly is a good addition to our daily diet."
521,"There are many words in the English language that are borrowed from Hindi like Avatar, Chit (chitti), Guru, Jungle and Loot. You can find many more examples like this. All these words have been included in the Oxford dictionary. Slowly as the world becomes more globalized, more and more Hindi words would find their way into the English dictionary."
522,"Remorse generally involves an implication of guilt on the part of the experiencer.A death in the family could cause a wide range of emotions depending on many factors but remorse would most often be associated if you personally caused the death in some way. Have you contributed to the death of a family member and feel nothing, or do you feel nothing when a family member passes away?The same goes for your girlfriend: do you hurt her feelings and feel nothing when she cries, or does she cry over other matters and you feel nothing?If it is the latter of the two, many factors, such as your preferred method of cognitive processing, could come into play. If you are a primary Thinker emotions are not going to come as naturally to you as they will for those who view the world through a Feeling lens. This is something that develops with time and some people who strongly prefer Thinking never wade too deep into ‚Äúthe feels.‚Äù Most societies also teach, inadvertently or not, that men ‚Äúaren't supposed to cry.‚ÄùChildhood dynamics could significantly factor in as well. Did you experience trauma of some kind in your formative years, say, age 2‚Äì12, or even multiple traumas? If so, too much exposure to highly emotional situations as a kid will send your body into ‚Äúself protection mode‚Äù as an adult, meaning you subconsciously bury those painful Feels. Therapy can help for this, but even simply being cognizant of it can as well, or having someone you trust to talk to, or journaling or some other form of creative expression. The biggest one, time, will also help to eventually shake out those emotions and that will usually happen whether you want it to or not. I call it the ‚Äúthawing out process.‚ÄùIf it is the former of the two and you are unable to experience remorse when you cause pain or damage to others then a Cluster B personality disorder is one possibility: think Dexter. Other possibilities are vast as well, though, brain damage being one, overall physical and emotional health, or lack thereof, being another.I'm a huge advocate of therapy for, well, everyone. If you're not opposed to trying out a therapist, I would seek out one with specific experience in emotional regulation/disregulation and/or any of the other topics that I or other writers have brought up. Remember, you can schedule an appointment to ‚Äúinterview‚Äù potential therapists and most will do this free of charge. Often if they don't it's a good sign to skip them anyway and getting the right ‚Äúvibe‚Äù with and from your therapist is a huge key to the success of the treatment regardless of how long you go. I saw probably 10 very different therapists over about a decade of my life, most for only a session or two, until I accidentally stumbled upon The One. And that, has made all the difference."
523,"Practice regularly, even if it's only a few minutes every day. If done every day or nearly every day, even 10 to 15 minutes will help build concentration, increase flexibility and strengthen willpower, making it easier to practice the next day. Consistency is key. If possible, establish a regular time of day to set aside for practice. Morning or evening practice is advised.Practice when your body is most limber. Some people find their bodies are stiff in the morning, making practice more difficult. Night practice, however may limit the kinds of postures you do as some are too stimulating and affect sleep. The key is regularity. Enjoy whatever time you have set aside for practice.Most yoga instructors believe that there is more benefit to doing a brief practice regularly than hit-or-miss home practice sessions, sporadic class attendance, or the occasional workshop. The greatest and longest-lasting benefits are achieved when at least 3 or 4 yoga asanas are done every day.Most experts recommend a minimum of 10 minutes of practice every day. However, to practice a range of postures and incorporate breathing or meditation, 15 to 25 minutes is necessary. These brief practice sessions should also be interspersed with longer sessions several times a week."
524,"This is an easy question to respond to with a joke. And I have enjoyed the humor in some of the other answers. But I‚Äôll attempt a serious one. As a guess (since I don‚Äôt know how you and your dog get along normally), I would say he was stressed out by the loud and aggressive energy between you and your friend, and urgently wanted to leave. It sounds like he had no intention of hurting you, but was using his mouth to ‚Äúcarry‚Äù you away. Your music may hurt his ears. Dog ears are MUCH more sensitive than ours. And it may sound angry and confrontational to him. And your reactions to winning may have looked like it could develop into a violent altercation. So he may be very distressed by the discomfort and the possible risk to his human in the situation. He sounds like a really smart dog, to bring you out to the car like that. And if I am right about his reasons, he is very devoted to you. Take good care of him.I answered - ‚ÄúWhy did my dog bite me? Me and my friend were having a rap battle. I killed him with this diss: ""he drops the bar of soap, there's no hope, the black prisoner makes him choke"". Everybody was cheering for me but my dog, kuro, wasn't happy. He bit my wrist not too painfully taking me with him outside to my car.‚Äù"

I should have fell on the rocks im sure it would have caused less damage to my body. the jerking back was what did the damage.
526,"If this is a one-time event I would apply a heating pad to relax the muscles. However, if this is frequent or persistent then I would consult a rheumatoligist to determine if I were developing arthritis. The most important thing to do whenever there is persistent pain is to obtain a diagnosis to ensure proper treatment is being provided. Early diagnosis is key to minimizing irreparable damage."

528,"Well, ""degrade"" is an interesting way to put it. Though hardware components do degrade over time, this process is slow and likely your hardware has shipped more capable than what it is set to perform. So a degradation will not affect the expected performance of the hardware, within 2 years there will be no difference.The other interesting point is ""longevity"". The causes of a laptop to be considered dated can be real slow downs, such as multiple background/startup programs hogging up resources, or in comparison, being so much slower than new machines. Since technology constantly improves, an older laptop will always under perform a newer one. So perhaps the goal is to purchase a machine that will stay within a small margin of the performance of newer products.Computer products have a tiered shift phenomenon, in which last generation's top model becomes this generation's mid-range, last mid-range becomes bottom tier, and the top model gets a new rendition. The only way to have your last generation PC to be as good as this generations mid-range is to purchase a top model. Top tier PCs often have expensive features tacked on that most people have no need for, such as a high performance graphics card, that drives up the price. It seems what the asker is seeking is how can I meet next generations mid-tier performance without buying a top-tier PC this generation.You have some good suggestions. Dollar for dollar a desktop PC will always outperform a similarly priced laptop, since desktop components focus on performance rather than size or power efficiency. It could be said that this generation's mid-tier desktop will perform at the level of next generation's mid-tier laptop. Adding an SSD is one of the most significant improvements that can be made to the current state of PC hardware. It is magnitudes faster than an HDD and the effects are noticeable in almost every application. Additionally, it is probably the only observable improvement to the current state of PC's that the average user would notice. Processors are already more than fast enough for general tasks, high tier graphics cards dont matter unless your gaming, more RAM does nothing (8GB is already generous). That really just leaves the data device.The short answer is you were right all along, get a desktop with an SSD and you will be miles ahead."

532,"Here is the state of the world now (only highlights).North Korea- Has missiles and Nukes in its stockpile. Their missiles do not have enough range to reach continental US. Even if they somehow manage to strike a few Nukes at the US, it will only affect the impact zones immediately. So it will result in the total wipe out of NK in the US‚Äôs retaliation. North does not want to nuke the south coz their first goal is to take over the south and unite the Koreas. It does not want to attack any of its neighbors simply because there are no compelling reasons to do so for North. So there‚Äôs no real threat.Russia- She has a lot of technologically advanced weapons. Some even better than the US. She has a stock pile of Nukes and intercontinental ballistic missiles. But they have one thing working against them. Their own economy. Their economy is weak. They cannot keep the supplies alive to support an all out war or an invasion. No place can be dominated or occupied without boots on the ground. So there‚Äôs no real threat.China- She has the largest army. Lot of hardware, strong economy, many missiles and long history as well. What is working against them is their size and their political leadership. Most of the weapons in their arsenal are old and reverse engineered stuff from the Soviet era. They are modernizing however, but not at the rates they want. Also their navy and air force does not have enough hardware to back an invasion. So no real threat.India- Certainly a large number of people, large army. Relatively modern Air force and Navy. India is historically peaceful and non-aggressive they have stood their ground against aggressors but never pushed back. Also the air force does not have the infrastructure to support an invasion. Navy has inadequate number of modern vessels. Submarine fleet is aging. Modernization is happening at a snail‚Äôs pace. Political leadership is not helping with the process either. So no real threat.Europe- Collectively, very powerful and has strategic advantage over the rest of the world due to sheer strength and size of hardware of individual members and the collective strategic knowledge and experience. However, Europe is not as united as they wish to be. Member nations have trust issues with each other due to leftover emotions from previous two world wars. Also there is an impending financial crisis and a social crisis due to the refugee movement. So no real threat.Africa-Individual nations(some of them) may be strong enough to defend own territories against invaders, however none of the African nations are strong enough to launch a war or an invasion against even their Asian neighbors; let alone European or American. Also, most of the continent is torn apart by countless civil wars, racial and tribal conflicts and regional disputes. There is not enough reasons for an outward spill-over of the conflicts. So no real threat.South America- Same as Africa. Third world countries, slow or crippled economies, poverty, smaller, largely inadequate military forces. There are no compelling reasons for them to cause a large scale conflict, let alone global. So no real threat.Middle East- There are a few who can put up a real tough fight against an invading foreign military.Their situational awareness, familiarity with terrain and guerrilla tactics are all advantageous but only works withing the region so they are only good at defense. Certain countries possess good hardware and moderately large modern armed forces. However, none of the Middle Eastern countries possess the military strength to lead an invasion on foreign land or sustain the defense of their own territories for a long time (including Iran). Also they are not synonymous with the modern equipment that they possess. This is because of lack of experience in large scale multi-face, multi-theater warfare and lack of trust between troops. This seriously undermines the collective efforts. So no real threat.Last but not least,USA- Uncle Sam checks off all items on the list when it comes to size, numbers and weaponry. Certainly strong, economy wise. Has a global reach and has lead countless invasions, successfully. They are already the dominating force and has a firm hand of control over the world with many military bases in strategic locations across the entire planet. She is ruling the world now, at least by a big margin (Economically, politically and strategically). So she wouldn‚Äôt do anything that would start a third world war and cause a global meltdown. Because once the world goes in to the chaos of war, the balance of power might tip against them. Off course she will get involved in many other small scale conflicts, trying to bring down a dictatorship or install a new one, home-delivering freedom and democracy to the needful. Still, no real threat.Unless something dramatic plays out anytime soon or some nut job decides to let some nukes loose willy-nilly, we are certainly not heading towards a third world war. So just relax and have a cold beer."

Without tune :This is the tricky part.Often musicians will be pleased to make songs with lyrics on hand.Ultimately both complements one another.If the tune is not ready and you have to start up with ur work first ,Dont think of chorus first !Make rough draft with the stanzas first.Chorus portions must gently slip into the song .It is often soothing /energetic (depending upon the situation ).If you find it difficult to find rhyming words , always have a discussion board with the creative people whom you know.A collective effort can be more helpful(provided the number of persons accompanying is less as too many people getting their hands on a single job often leads to mishap )Apart from these have a good spot to write you song which is naturally compelling you to be more creativeAnd thanks for the A2A!"

542,"I recently wrote about this on my blog, which you can find here: How Can A Software Developer Become A Business Analyst? - Joe BarriosHere are the highlights.1) Learn to think like a Business Analyst. The mindset of a developer is completely different from what you need as a BA. Software developers are responsible for building code, they‚Äôre not required to understand the business reasons for the code. By the time it‚Äôs the developer‚Äôs turn to code, all business questions/scenarios/concerns should have been addressed and resolved.A BA has to do all of the work to figure out what to put into those specs to begin with. The developer‚Äôs role is very much ‚Äúin the weeds.‚Äù The BA is required to think more holistically about the entire business and about how to best meet business needs. It is their responsibility to get a project into a state where the software developer can simply be concerned with building the code.In order to make the transition you have to start asking some of the questions that BA‚Äôs ask. Why is the software code required in the first place? What business problem will it solve? Who will the code help? Where will the code be used by the business? How can the software be leveraged for future business capabilities? And so on.2) Learn the BABOK. The Business Analysis Body of Knowledge is the BA‚Äôs ‚Äúbible.‚Äù You should become familiar with it, as it covers all of the basic BA concepts and techniques.3) Learn Business Process Modeling. Documenting and re-engineering business processes are a core BA competency. Developers may have similar experience with documenting workflows, data flows, sequence diagrams, etc., so this may not be a big lift.4) Get involved with the business. Start sitting in on meetings that define business strategy and analyze business needs. Get to know your company‚Äôs BA‚Äôs and ask to participate in their requirements sessions. It‚Äôs important to learn the perspective of a business and what it seeks to accomplish. In doing so you may also find people willing to mentor you to help your transition to business analysis.5) Understand the role of software in the larger system and business. A developer may be most concerned with the software that ‚Äúhe owns.‚Äù It‚Äôs important to understand how pieces of software are part of a larger integrated whole: the interfaces to other applications and systems, the interaction of human users with those systems, and the business capabilities enabled by applications and systems of systems.6) Leverage your technical knowledge as an asset. Having a software development background is a huge asset to a Business Analyst. It allows you to serve as an ideal bridge between IT and the business, since you are able to speak the technical language of IT. Being a developer also provides you insight into what is possible with coding, and how applications and systems may be changed to provide future business capabilities."

544,"I started lucid dreaming when I was a kid. I haven't even been aware that normally people can't control their dream til I was 12 (15 now).I know that I lucid dream... A LOT. I've heard that a lot of people wanted to try out once and I even helped one of my friend doing it be telling him to keep clinching his cheek, no matter it is in reality or in his dream.But I can tell you, lucid dreaming is not all that good. And somehow, I hate lucid dreaming and I will wake myself up whenever I find myself in that situation by fake sneezing (I found that this method is the BEST to wake myself up). Strange but I always end up with sleep paralysis, which is that I see horrifying things like ghosts in my room and having my body paralyzed and squeezed on my bed, when I try to shout for help, I just end up making no sound like I'm a mute. And it follows a panic attack. WORST EXPERIENCE EVER.Moreover, although I have had some cool lucid dreams... flying around, having magic and... well mostly about sex after I entered puberty, I guess, due to the sexual impulse (sorry I can't help Xd). I sometimes also get some horrifying dreams. Usually is when I found out that I'm dreaming, I say to myself: No, I'm now dreaming so I can't think of horrifying things such as ghosts or demons as they will instantly appear. And poof, here goes the worst dream, as you will hear, see, and feel. Usually dreams goes bad when I think of something like that and usually too scary that I must wake myself, then followed by the crazy feeling due to sleep paralysis.Therefore, I enjoy some of the dreams, but due to that I have had it too many times that my mind is developed to make the dreams not so enjoyable and comfortable and crazily turns it from a Harry Potter fantasy to a crazy chainsaw killer kidnap.So seriously, if you want to lucid dream, you could by pinching yourself, like every hour or so and make this event memorable and make yourself do it even when dreaming, this makes you realize that you are dreaming and thus starts a lucid dream. But, just please don't overdo it as it could get all wrong and undesirable.Oh and funny thing, when I start to sense that I might be dreaming, I'll clinch my cheek, a few dozen times just to be sure that I'm really dreaming (don't want to die when testing out my flying and ending up dead in reality). I did it too much that one time I asked myself: will my cheek just get torn apart? And you guessed it right. I got a glob of flesh pulled down but still attached to my face and is swinging like a pendulum... after that... I clinched my leg for testing. Hopefully it will go on smoothly =["
545,"I have been at both ends of the spectrum.During my teen years, I was chubby, short, had acne rosacea, glasses, braces, and I was a smart but shy music nerd. I felt invisible and self-conscious. I hardly have any pictures of that time. Some people said unkind things about my appearance that I still remember to this day.When I hit my growth spurt, lost the weight, my braces came off, got contact lenses, my skin recovered, and my confidence grew with having to interact with more people in university and my career, it was a stark difference in how I was treated as an individual. I wasn‚Äôt invisible anymore. Over time I‚Äôve learned to value my health above all, and regard my body as the only one we are given so it‚Äôs best to take good care of it and treat it with respect.There were stares and double-takes.Random people would start to compliment me on my appearance such as my outfit, or my lipstick, or what do I use for skincare. They would say it plainly: ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre so pretty!‚Äù or ‚ÄúWhy are you not modeling somewhere right now?‚Äù Comments from people young or old, male or female. It seems like people are more comfortable approaching you if you‚Äôre attractive to say something nice, and certainly I‚Äôve learned to accept their compliments graciously with thanks.I noticed that I would get better treatment and service, whether it‚Äôs in town or traveling abroad.For the most part, it is great. And especially nowadays, people practically faint when I tell them I‚Äôm 38 - they then try to grab the attention of whoever else is in the nearby vicinity and bellow out my age like it‚Äôs a public service announcement because I look younger now than I did when I was 18. So there‚Äôs that.Sometimes, I do sense some jealousy because I‚Äôve heard some comments like ‚Äúskinny bitch‚Äù in the dressing room or ‚Äúdid you get plastic surgery?‚Äù These untrue comments don‚Äôt bother me, as the comments I had when I was unattractive were far worse.I‚Äôm quite observant and find attractiveness in everyone. I always try to tell a person if possible what I find beautiful or attractive about them ie. Hey, awesome shoes, man! Love your hair colour! You have THE best smile‚Ä¶If you would like to experience the peak of feeling ‚Äúattractive‚Äù, I recommend doing an all-inclusive photo shoot package in Hong Kong where they take care of everything to make you feel ultra glam - from taking your photos in a gorgeous studio, doing your hair and makeup, outfitting you in multiple changes of fantastical attire, PLUS they provide you lunch!"

548,"I work in buyside finance and looked into this as a sort of fun valuation exercise. The surprising and amusing answer is yes, USC could straight up buy UCLA: land, hospital, and all.https://ucla.app.box.com/acct-pd... Referring to page 12 of the annual financial report, we see that UCLA is heavily leveraged on government backed debt. As a public university, UCLA has access to ridiculous amounts of cheap debt because its existence is secured by the government as a corollary of the University of California's mission: to educate the common people of California. Therefore, it needs little collateral to achieve high levels of leverage, theoretically past its total equity value. In this case we see an asset-debt ratio of: 9019 million / 11,694 million = 77%.Its umbrella entity, the University of California allocates funds separately across each of the UC campuses, so any loan default is further guaranteed by this larger entity. We'll note however, that on page 14 of the report, the university's bonds were dropped a grade from Aa1 to Aa2 in 2014 (a pretty big deal, comparable to US government's credit rating being downgraded from AAA to AA+ during the mortgage crisis) signifying that the rating agencies are beginning to perceive UCLA as hitting the limits of risk-free borrowing despite its innately low-risk and unexciting mission of public service. The idea is that private or public for-profit corporations can sustain a level of debt at 77% of its assets in the pursuit of near term growth, but a not-for-profit entity with no foreseeable revenue growth has no business taking on this much debt.UCLA's net position is less than $2 billion, lower than its endowment. This includes the ridiculously valuable land that UCLA sits on, which coupled with its buildings is worth $5.7 billion, half of UCLA's total asset value. A major thing contributing to UCLA's huge liability accounts are the pensions and benefits owed to retirees.http://about.usc.edu/files/2014/... On the other hand, many would observe USC's balance sheet and see it as an investor's dream. It takes on $2.5 billion in debt, which is barely half its yearly revenues. From a financial perspective, USC is under utilizing debt, but obviously cannot effectively acquire the same levels of leverage as UCLA, as USC is a private entity without the government guarantee and interest subsidies UCLA as access to. USC is the far more financially sustainable institution, sitting at a net position of $7.46 billion, which is... a lot more than UCLA, almost 3.75x to be exact. To achieve this, USC has had to cross some large chasms in the past, such as in the relative value of its land and buildings ($2.9 billion compared to UCLA's $5.7 billion). The fact that it's even in the same magnitude says a lot about the success of USC's financial strategy over the long term. While UCLA is situated on far more valuable land that has benefited from enormous appreciation AND owns more acreage, its buildings are older and are beginning to hit their depreciation limit, while USC has been injecting literally billions into new buildings for its campus and surrounding area over the past decade or two. USC owns the majority of off-campus student housing in the University Park area, including the under-construction University Village. In addition, Pat Haden's efforts led USC to snagging the 99-year lease on the Coliseum involving rights to all revenues... just one year before news comes out that an NFL team will be moving to LA. And along with them 3-4 years of ticket sales to USC as the Rams await the construction of their own stadium. Someone there is making some good decisions.If we were to look at UCLA to see whether or not it could be reasonably ""bought"" by USC, we'd have to first take the factors established above and temporarily suspend disbelief in placing a market value on the UCLA campus and owned entities. If UCLA was floated at the value of its assets minus liabilities i.e. book value, it would only be worth $1.9 billion. If it was floated at 1x its revenues, it would be worth $4.9 billion. For a non-profit entity with no predicted revenue growth, I would say these numbers provide a reasonable lower and upper bound. Unfortunately, I can't apply an EBIDTA multiple to this valuation as UCLA is operating at a loss of $1.081 billion, subsidized by $268 million in private gifts and $242 million in injections from the University of California, both highly unsustainable income streams.Applying the above valuation metrics towards USC as a corporation, we would arrive at a tentative market value of around 3 times as much. If anything were to kill this deal, it would be USC's public finance investment bankers snapping them out of wanting to acquire an entity that's bleeding a billion dollars a year.Let's say UCLA is valued anywhere in between its present book value and estimated market value inclusive of goodwill ($1.9-4.9 billion). USC presently holds $450 million in cash. If they were to structure a leveraged buy-out at the standard ratio of 10% equity to 90% debt, they would have $4.5 billion purchasing power. This is just short of buying up only UCLA's land and buildings ($5.7 bil) as standalone assets, but quite reasonably enough to buy the whole of UCLA inclusive of its liens and liabilities. The $4 billion debt stack would be secured by USC's other assets and revenue generating holdings. If USC were to borrow the full amount necessary to buy UCLA, they would still have less debt than UCLA does currently - both as a flat amount and in proportion to their assets: (2516 + 4000) = 6516 million (65%) vs. 9019 million (77%) respectively.Of course, whether the UC Regents would just go ahead and agree to selling their #2 campus is another matter. Leveraged buyouts don't quite work the same way when there are no shareholders. Furthermore, there is an invisible line of credit that comes out of the University of California that can't be accounted for as we don't know how much the Regents would commit to shielding UCLA from a stock buyout in the event of a hostile takeover. By exposing the equity holdings of the other 9 UC campuses in a poorly executed takeover defense, such as by splitting its equity stack but failing to unload all of its shares in time, USC could just buy a 51% ownership stake and accidentally end up with controlling interest in all 10 UC campuses. Woops. Might be better to not risk the body for the limb.In any case, it's evident that the UCs aren't in fantastic shape financially, which can be deceptive if you're only looking at budget and endowment figures, for which these two institutions aren't that far apart. While it looked like business went on as usual for public universities post-recession, their issues were really just swept under an enormous rug of debt. It's not like USC is quite as wealthy as Harvard or Yale, but USC does look like it's in a place where it has a ton of financial headroom for expansion that it hasn't yet begun utilize. If the world of public finance was quite as cutthroat and unregulated as buyside corporate finance, I wouldn't be surprised if UCLA would have been renamed USC Westwood years ago. Then again, in this fictional dystopia, everyone would probably be attending one of Harvard Corporation's 100 campuses."
549,"Ten weeks ago I was at my wife's business and my daughters phoned to tell me that she wouldn't be home till late as she and her boyfriend were going out. Fifteen minutes later she phoned again, but this time it was a stranger asking for Tyler's mum or dad and that Tyler's car had been in a crash (it was hit by a speeding unmarked police car) and that she was ok but they were waiting for an ambulance.I got the address and was there within 8 minutes. It was horrific, my daughter was still trapped in the car, the firemen were just starting to cut the roof and doors off of the car. Tyler was sitting in the passenger seat being supported from behind by a fireman who was stopping her from moving. She was covered in blood with a gash across her clearly broken nose.Because her car ended up knocking over and on top of a cable cupboard with live electricity it took over an hour and a half to get her out and on the way to hospital. They took her to the Royal London, which has a specialist trauma unit. At the hospital they found that she had broken her neck. The fracture being of the C2, which is also known as the hangman's fracture. The Neurosurgeon told me that if the fireman had not held her for that hour and a half to stop her moving she would almost certainly be either paralysed or dead.In the end she was in hospital for a week and she still has an Aspen brace on her neck, which hopefully will be able to come off in a few weeks after more scans. Her scars are healing well.I learnt that one'‚Äôs life can change in a second, through no fault or cause of your own and that you have to make the most of every minute.‚ÄãYou can just make out the fireman supporting my daughter. He is a hero."

551,"I don‚Äôt talk about personal politics on public forums; instead, I will stick to facts as much as possible. In short, everything below I believe to be true, but not everything I believe is true is written below. (-:It‚Äôs far too early to know for sure exactly what the impact will be. As of this writing (mid-Nov 2016) we don‚Äôt even know who is going to be in key policy positions. Then, we don‚Äôt know how the Senate and House will react to their policy views. We don‚Äôt know how much party-line‚Äîcrossing there will be; likely very little for the most part, but that is harder to predict if a policy is clearly prejudicial or damaging to the economy at large.Now, in terms of impact, there are personal impacts and job impacts.In terms of job impacts, it seems highly unlikely that anyone who is well-educated will do poorly in the short term. The US has tremendous economic opportunities for people who are skilled in high-value fields. Those companies are not going to fill their jobs out of nowhere. If the government starts to put in place policies that make it difficult to hire talented employees, companies will take those positions to where the employees are ‚Äî abroad ‚Äî creating exactly the opposite situation of what Trump promised when he ran. Of course, politics rarely follows along strictly rational lines of calculation, but ultimately it‚Äôs therefore important to separate bluster for the press versus what actually happens quietly in the background.Keep in mind, also, that if the job market does change by the time you graduate, unless the Revolution comes, you‚Äôre hardly the one who will be impacted. Anyone who is willing to pick up sticks, move half-way around the world, deal with differences in language and food and climate and a dozen other things, is likely going to have a place somewhere in the world. Getting a quality education can only help that.In terms of personal impacts, it might depend quite a bit on what you look like ‚Äî in some locations. However, the vast majority especially of US research universities are not located in the places that are also appear to be the most prejudiced. Indeed, this election further widened the gap between urban and rural areas, and urban areas resoundingly voted for a more global perspective. A student at Brown doesn‚Äôt live in the USA as much as they live in Providence, a vibrant, multi-cultural town with numerous nationalities and races represented broadly. Inasmuch as you think the vote for Trump says anything, only about five states gave Clinton a higher percentage of vote (and not by much) than Rhode Island. So to someone who lived here, on a day-to-day basis, there would hardly be any perceptible difference in treatment. If anything, at this moment many people are especially sensitive and careful about how they treat others.It is also easy to forget how much progress has been made in the US. People reading about the election from a distance, getting news dominated by Trump, might be surprised to hear that in this election season, the US has voted in [list courtesy Brighten Godfrey]:Stephanie Murphy (FL) ‚Äî first Vietnamese-American woman elected to CongressCatherine Cortez Masto (NM) ‚Äî first Latina elected to U.S. SenatePramila Jayapal (WA) ‚Äî first person of South Asian descent elected to House of RepresentativesKamala Harris (CA) ‚Äî first person of South Asian descent elected to U.S. SenateIlhan Omar (MN) ‚Äî first Somali-American legislator (she was elected to the state house of representatives)Kate Brown (OR) ‚Äî first openly LGBTQ governorTammy Duckworth (IL) ‚Äî first female senator that has seen combat, and second Asian-American female senatorSamuel Park (GA) ‚Äî first openly gay man in the Georgia legislatureand so on. I bet those stories were not covered in the international press. Note that Ilhan Omar is openly Muslim, and even wears a hijab. There are many Muslim countries where she could not even stand for election.Finally, just remember that eight years ago the USA voted in its first black president. Things go in cycles. History is long, and bears reading.Personally, I‚Äôm pretty confident I could mail out my resume to a bunch of different countries and get pretty positive responses. (When something happens in the US, I get notification from foreign friends of job postings at their university‚Ä¶.) Let‚Äôs just say I haven‚Äôt dusted off my vita at all. In time, I think most things heal themselves. In the meanwhile, I‚Äôm committed to doing what I can to improve the education of students and state of knowledge‚Äîthe very same things I was committed to the day before the election."

553,"This one hack can sure as hell help you save minutes and in some cases hours of your day.Remember the last time when you SNOOZED the alarm, not once but thrice and finally woke up an hour later.Also, remember how you got guilty later wasting that one hour and probably missing the breakfast (used to happen a lot with me since I live in a hostel)We all face this daily or at best on weekends when we do not really have to compulsorily wake up on time.After months of this routine I realized no matter how big was the urge of going back to sleep and snoozing that alarm, every time I splashed my face with water, suddenly the sleep ceased to occur.

554,"So I‚Äôve actually done this before and the way your question is worded I‚Äôm guessing so have you?I was doing an internship during summer break while I was going to college. I don‚Äôt think it is necessary to go into the reasons why I did what I did; however, after doing it for around 4 to 6 weeks I noticed that it really wasn‚Äôt helping me lose weight. Now I wouldn‚Äôt do it after every meal, but I did it enough, at least once a day, sometimes two, 4 to 6 days a week. I would think that should count for something! So I started researching it and what I learned is that in many cases, your body has already done a lot of digesting by the time you get to your ‚Äúplace of purge.‚ÄùFrom the time you start eating, to the time you finish, how long does that normally take? Your body goes to work doing it‚Äôs thing as soon as you see food. So the second that first bite hits your tummy its going to town doing what it does best. By the time you finish your last bite you‚Äôve already digested a fair amount of the food you ate. And if you‚Äôre out with friends and family, or your at home with family around, it‚Äôs going to take even longer for you to get to a place where you can do it without them noticing (I assume you don‚Äôt want anyone to know‚Ä¶). -I guess if you live alone and you down a pint of Ben & Jerry‚Äôs in under 5 minutes every night your results may be different-Eventually I realized that it just wasn‚Äôt worth the pain and suffering of barfing and I stopped. Puking sucks mega hard, especially when you‚Äôre puking up stomach acid and half digested food. I‚Äôve found very few foods that taste the same coming up as they did going down.I‚Äôm not here to judge you, or tell you to stop. I‚Äôm not going to tell you to go get professional help because its dangerous and you could die, blah blah blah. I know the mind set of bulimia because I experienced it and I know that most of the answers you‚Äôre going to read will not change your plans. You‚Äôre going to do what you want to do and I respect whatever you decide. All I can do is share my experiences and answer your question - How much weight do you lose after purging?Well, not including water weight, you probably are not losing that much. If you compare the weight you‚Äôd lose by taking a dump after a meal to the weight you‚Äôd lose by puking after a meal, it would be a small amount. If losing weight is your goal, you should probably find something that is 1) more socially acceptable and 2) works better. If you eat a crazy meal one day, try fasting for 12 -24 hours the next day. What that‚Äôs doing is taking that crazy meal and spreading it out over 2 days! Not as bad that way, in fact it‚Äôs probably better than if you were to eat 2 normal meals over the course of 2 days!Whatever you end up doing, just make sure you don‚Äôt lose sight of your goals. If your goal is to lose weight (fat) there are easier/faster/healthier ways than purging. If your goal is to feel immediate satisfaction followed by guilt, well you might want to take a few minutes and rethink your goals. I wish you the best of luck!"

558,"Technically not very different than a hedge fund.¬† Gather seed investment capital, and start investing - make decent returns - raise more capital - repeat.¬† However, that's where the similarities between HF and PE ends.¬† The actual investment process couldn't be more different.People often say that anybody can start a HF, and it's true, investing $10M in securities isn't all that different than investing $1,000.¬† Picking the right stocks can be very difficult however, so while getting a good performance is difficult, just getting the fund started is easy.PE is the opposite, it's easy to find right investments, but it's much harder to actually place the investment.Easier to make returns:Let's say I buy some shares of Apple, say $1,000,000 worth of stock.¬† Now, to make return, I just sit back and wait for the stock to pop - and cross my fingers the mgmt doesn't mess up.¬† And may be also pray that the board decides to increase dividend.¬† Obviously, this leaves lot of room for error, to make a good investment, not only does the financials and valuations need to make sense, but the key players - mgmt/board must do the right thing.¬† This is a lot to get it right.But, what if I give you full control of Apple after you invest the money.¬† So, say I invested the same $1M into Apple.¬† But this time, I can control the company's capital structure.¬† So, first thing I do after investing is payout the most of Apple's cash as special dividend, based on Apple's current cash holdings, it'd be about 20% of the market cap.¬† So, right off the bat, I get 20% of my original investments back.¬† Then I look at Apple's capital structure and see that it hardly has any debt.¬† Based on its FCF of $120B per year, Apple can easily issue $300B 5 year bond at low interest rates.¬† Take the $300B, then pay that out as dividend as well.¬† That gives you additional 60% of your original investment back.¬† So, now, all you invested in Apple is $200k, and you successfully minimized $1M investment's exposure down to $200k.¬† Now, your plan is to exit your investment at year 5, after you pay off your $300B bond - if Apple does exactly as well as it does today, no better or no worse, at year four, your investment should be worth $800k, and you'd have made 400% return on your investments in 5 years.¬† Not bad.¬† That's not all, to squeeze more juice and improve the financials around your exit time, you can stop much of long term R&D activities and save money, in the old days, you could also reduce salary and increase stock options, but GAAP put a stop to that practice by requiring options to be expensed right away.¬† Also, you can start selling parts of the company that the public doesn't care about, say Apple has a publishing arm that prints all its manuals, designs and makes packagings, it's likely that Apple's valuation won't be affected even if you sell it off.¬† So, you sell those units that the public doesn't know or care about, generating extra returns.¬† You can also fire a bunch of people particularly in non-production roles, this will improve your financials and you can generate higher valuation on your exit.¬† Then you sell the company by taking it public.¬† Of course, not all PE shops do this, and this type of activities were much more prevalent in the old days when people weren't aware of these tricks.¬† However, my point is that PE shops have lot of recourses to make their investments perform.¬† One more thing, PE managers also pay themselves fee when they close a deal, typically in 2-3% of the investment made.¬† This fee is paid right away and comes out of the fund.But harder to place an investmentThe difficulty is in actually closing a deal.¬† Let's say you somehow raised $100M and set up a PE shop without any experience in banking and without network of business managers and bankers.¬† Now, your job is to buy a company.¬† How do you do that?¬† Hiring a team of bankers is easy enough, and perhaps they can get you few meetings with company managements, but you'll hit an immediate road block there.¬† If you're the management of the company, when a PE approaches you, they're not only looking to be an investor in your company, but also trying to be your boss.¬† More often than not, PE will lay you off after they buy your company.¬† So, what mgmt often does is to talk to their board and investors that PE is bad news - if you have no credibility as a PE, it'd be rather easy for mgmt to brush off your attempts.¬† Even if you somehow get the mgmt to get on board by offering lots of severance and paying high premium in valuation, you probably still won't be able to close the deal.¬† Because, PE buyouts are typically leveraged buyouts - meaning that you need to borrow money to complete your purchase.¬† If you don't have cred in PE, not only bank syndicate will require higher equity ratio (which will destroy your economics) and higher rates, it probably won't go through - they don't like the risk of investing in a rookie PE shop.¬† This is the main reason why almost every single PE founders have very senior level banking experience, while HF founders have varied backgrounds from college dropouts to consultants to bankers to business owners.EDIT:¬† Let me be clear on one thing, buying $5-10M small business or startup venture is *NOT* what I'm talking about here.¬† Technically that's private equity too, but it really isn't.¬† I'm talking about $1B+ enterprise value private equity deal that involves syndicated leveraged financing."
559,"SleepThese days it has become very common among the youngsters to sleep very late say 2 AM, 2.30 AM. And get up at 7 AM something, rush to our college/work. Then come back exhausted in the evening, do what is called as catching up on sleep for some time, then the same cycle repeats.Were we humans programmed for such a lifestyle when we evolved to what we are today? The answer is an obvious NO. Let‚Äôs try to understand the importance of sleep for our body.The term ‚Äúbody clock‚Äù which in a vague sense refers to our sleep timings, hunger etc. A more technical term for it is Circadian rhythm which is defined as a biological process which is periodic and keeps repeating itself roughly after 24 hours in sync with the surrounding environment. In human body this involves oscillations on a daily basis in the levels of one particular hormone called Melatonin. This hormone is secreted by the pineal gland situated in the brain. During daytime when there is light, this gland is inactive and when darkness truly seeps in (before the invention of the light bulb) secretes this hormone which induces sleep. Then again the next morning roughly after 10-12 hours when light is back, the gland switches off and the hormone‚Äôs levels in the blood fall drastically. Hence the primary function of this hormone seems to be to induce sleep.[1][2]To quote some popular culture, this hormone shows Vampire like behavior, coming out in the dark and vanishing during daytime.That‚Äôs why we have night shift workers whose sleep patterns are even more erratic which is a major cause for worry as there have been reports that among that class of people cancer occurrences have been pretty high.[3]When investigations were carried out into the causes for the Chernobyl disaster and the Challenger Space Shuttle‚Äôs accident, one of the reasons found was poor judgment and decisions from the sleep deprived, tired workers. That‚Äôs enough to show the dangers sleep deprivation holds.[4]Sleep is God, go worship!- Jim ButcherFootnotes[1] Melatonin: Never Ignore This ""Wonder Hormone""[2] Why do we sleep?[3] The Health Risks of Shift Work[4] 5 Other Disastrous Accidents Related To Sleep Deprivation"

Now your task is to drink all the water without letting a single drop spill on the ground.Thats probablly a very good analogy to MechE, because of the ammount of different material that you cover, you will learn electrical engineering, computer science, computer engineering, material science, civil engineering, Fluid mechanics, Thermodynamics, Physics, control systems, Vibrations, Heat transfer, Physics, Chemistry, Math, etc.I will never forget that when I took Mechanical Components, every chapters was a totally different class. For instance chapter one was all about electronics and responses, chapter 2 was all about thermodynamics , chapter 3 all about fluids, chapter 4 all about strain gages, etc.My advice will be to try to teach yourself Computer Science specially Matlab and be good at it!PS: I am not saying all of this to discourage you, just be aware that there will be alot of material and good luck!"

562,"The reason for so many IQ questions is because either some people feel like their self value revolves around their IQ, some people are not successful so to make them feel special they say that they have a high IQ to make people think that they are smart so they mean something, some people have nothing in life by which I mean they are not sporty, not handsome, not good at making friendships, not good at any school subjects, and in order to feel like they are good at something, they say that they have a high IQ even though they suck at every subject at school, and some people just like saying that they have a high IQ just to brag. There are many different people on quora with many different reasons to tell their IQ or to ask questions about their IQ. However, most of the time, the reason they do this is because even thought they are not good at math, not good at english/language, not good at public speaking, not good at sports, not good at acting, and etc, at least they have a high IQ to validate that they are intelligent, not any substantial evidence besides an IQ test to show that they are intelligent. They do not or did not show any giftedness in math, science, english, etc, but, hey they have a high IQ, so none of that matters to them. All they need to do is to show people they are a different kind of intellect, by that I mean a person with a high IQ, and they don‚Äôt need to be good at any subject in school to be intelligent, because to them that doesn‚Äôt matter. All that matters is having a high IQ."
563,"No man can.Not even Dave Consiglio!Why?The Earth is big. Like, really big. All that mass holds Earth strongly together. Destroying it would involve hitting it with something roughly Earth sized or else running a black hole by it or exploding a star or some such.But no one can do those things, either. Remember, early on Earth got hit by something Mars sized. Earth survived. Besides, if we could move a planet or a black hole, we could probably just pick the Earth up and fling it into the sun, which would likely do the trick. :)Now, if you want to kill everyone, that's a different story. Nuclear weapons have been mentioned already, but honestly, I think it would be hard to kill everyone this way. Most people? Sure. But everyone? Possible, but difficult.So how do we do it? Easy. First, you get the premier of China to go on a death wish. He orders the construction of an asteroid capture mission. The purpose is to put an asteroid in orbit around the moon and study it. But, the premier then secretly sabotages the thing to deflect asteroids toward Earth. Find an asteroid more than around 20 miles across, aim for Asia, and watch the dust fly. Literally.By striking the land, you kick up enormous amounts of dust which blacken the skies and starve billions. Asia is geologically active almost everywhere, so you get enormous earthquakes and volcanic eruptions, which throw up more dust and ash. Oh, and nearly half of humanity lives in Asia, so you wipe more people out just with the impact this way.Why China? NASA and the ESA are probably too transparent and poorly funded for something like this. But China? China might just be able to pull this off."

568,"I've met many people who say, 'I wish I could write', or 'I've always wanted to write but I just can't'. I believe that if you can think, you can write. If you can talk, you can write. Because writing is nothing but talking... on paper. But what I do understand is that starting the process of thinking on paper is difficult. Somehow, all the thoughts that flow out in an organized, clear fashion when you are talking to your friends or family, seem to get all jumbled up and incoherent when you sit down to write them down. But ""you can't cross the sea merely by standing and staring at the water,"" as Tagore said. You have to just start writing. So that's what I'm going to talk about - how to write, i.e, how to think on paper. Unclog the brain pipesTo start writing you need to do just that: start writing. Get something to write on, clear a space to write in, put your pen to paper, and just GO! Start writing and don't stop. Don't stop to question. Don't stop to think. Don't stop to notice what rubbish might be coming out of your hand. ""I always start writing with a clean piece of paper and a dirty mind."" - writer Patrick Dennis. This is a brain detox exercise. You know how in yoga there is a detox exercise where you stick two fingers down your throat and throw up toxins? This is just that. It cleans your dirty mind. Nobody will ever read this. You don't even have to read it. This exercise has two purposes:Getting your jumble of thoughts out of you... so unclog your thinking pipes; and You will see that what was in your head is now on paper. Even if in an incoherent mumbling fashion. But now you can start to see how your logical thoughts can be put down on paper as well.Think of One Clear Idea to write aboutRemember in school, we were given a topic to write an essay on: 'TV - Is it a Boon or a Bane?' Or something like that. It's that exercise. But in this case it's easier because you can pick any topic you like and already talk about. For e.g. '10 Reasons Why My Daughter Should Not Stay Out Late at Night', or, 'Let Me Tell You Why This Government is Better/Worse Than the Last One' or whatever gets you going... Each piece you write should have one clear topic/idea/direction. Then you can develop that idea fully and not get pulled in different directions. For example, this piece is about how to get started writing for general communication. If I started talking about writing as art, for poems or novels, or different genres and languages, I'd get lost. Stay on point with one big idea. Is it really love?If you are knowledgeable and passionate about the topic you choose, it will come through loud and clear. Just like when you talk to someone passionate or energetic, their passion can be infectious, in the same way that passion can also be conveyed in writing. That is what attracts people to your writing - not merely the knowledge you share, but the passion you convey. If you care about what you're writing, others will care too. Use emotions to connect to other people. Write for someone close to youWhen I first started writing I would always start each article with 'Dear Dad, Let me tell you what I think about this topic...' And then my thoughts would flow as if I was talking to dad. (I would always remember to delete this line before submitting though!) So when you write think about talking to someone you talk to all the time, like your son. 'Beta, let me tell you why Amitabhji is an evergreen hero...' ""Writing means sharing. It's part of the human condition to want to share things - thoughts, ideas, opinions."" - writer Paulo Coelho Get up-close and personalSo get personal with your reader and share what you know and think. The reason I say imagine you are writing to someone you trust or are close to is because then you don't worry about opening yourself up. If I tell you a story as I would my best friend, you would feel connected to me. ..."
569,"Hare Krishna,There was no Big Bang. It is a great illusion created by mental speculation.The Universe is eternal, we are eternal, and there is no beginning or ending of us or the Universe.This has been confirmed in The Bhagavad Gita, which is a summary of all Vedic knowledge.‚ÄúMaterial nature and the living entities should be understood to be beginningless. Their transformations and the modes of matter are products of material nature.‚Äù - Bhagavad Gita, Chapter 13, Verse 20.We merely change our forms in different lives. But we are eternal beings and the Universe is also eternal. Creation and destruction are merely change in forms. The Universe itself is eternal like us, but it is merely changing its form. The changes have been taking place since eternity and will continue till eternity. We all will exist in some form or the other eternally. And this whole Universe will also exist till eternity. This is the secret of existence.Never was there a time when I did not exist, nor you, nor all these kings; nor in the future shall any of us cease to be. - Bhagavad Gita, Chapter 2, Verse 12.Creation and destruction is simply an illusion.The Universe is existing and we all are existing. The Universe was existing, and we all were existing. The Universe will be existing, and we all will be existing always, forever, eternally. Our permanent identity is devotee of Sri Krishna, Sri Krishna's permanent identity is Supreme Lord. These identities never change in past, present, or future.Currently we all have forgotten our real identity as the devotees, as the associates of Sri Krishna. Therefore this knowledge of eternal life, eternal existence has been stolen away from us by Maya (illusion). This is the root cause of all confusion and suffering in this world. We have forgotten our eternal identity as devotees of the Almighty Lord.We just have to accept these true, eternal, permanent, non-changing identities, and then all chaos and confusion will end. Everyone will become perfectly enlightened.The only problem is that we don't accept our identity as devotees, associates of the Lord. Therefore Maya has captured us all, and we are wandering here and there in search of answers.Once we accept our true identity as the devotee, as the part and parcel of the divine Lord, Maya will lose her jurisdiction over us, and all answers, all knowledge will be revealed to us from within our heart, where Sri Krishna is already sitting as the paramatma (Super Soul).It is merely a question of recognizing the Lord, and accepting our eternal relationship with Him as associates and devotees. If we act in this world with such an attitude of devotion to the Lord, everything will be clearly visible to us. There will be no place for doubt, confusion, illusion, or ignorance. Maya can be wiped out completely by the grace of Lord Krishna.Even our scientists are beginning to find what Lord Krishna has already revealed: No Big Bang? Quantum equation predicts universe has no beginningWe, the devotees of Lord Krishna, know very well that Sri Krishna is the perfect scientist because He is God.He is the original Author of the Vedas, and He has perfect knowledge about everything. He has manifested this Universe from His energy, and He is the Supreme Lord.‚ÄúI am seated in everyone's heart, and from Me come remembrance, knowledge and forgetfulness. By all the Vedas am I to be known; indeed I am the compiler of VedƒÅnta, and I am the knower of the Vedas.‚Äù - Bhagavad Gita, Chapter 15, Verse 15.Therefore we simply accept His statements as true and avoid wasting our time. We utilize this time for doing Bhakti of Lord Krishna, the supreme scientist.Our recommendation to all intelligentsia in this world is - please stop wasting so much time, money and energy in mental speculation. Simply surrender to the Supreme Scientist, Lord Krishna. Chant His names, and you shall achieve all perfection and realize the absolute truth.Arjuna could see all the secrets of the Universe within Krishna's universal form, because he did not speculate. He surrendered himself to the supreme scientist Sri Krishna, and Sri Krishna blessed him with this vision -Bhagavad Gita, Chapter 11, Text 13tatraika-stha·πÅ jagat k·πõtsna·πÅpravibhaktam anekadhƒÅapa≈õyad deva-devasya≈õarƒ´re pƒÅ·πá·∏çavas tadƒÅSYNONYMStatra‚Äîthere; ekastham‚Äîone place; jagat‚Äîuniverse; k·πõtsnam‚Äîcompletely; pravibhaktam‚Äîdivided in; anekadhƒÅ‚Äîmany kinds; apa≈õyat‚Äîcould see; deva-devasya‚Äîof the Supreme Personality of Godhead; ≈õarƒ´re‚Äîin the universal form; pƒÅ·πá·∏çava·∏•‚ÄîArjuna; tadƒÅ‚Äîat that time.TRANSLATIONAt that time Arjuna could see in the universal form of the Lord the unlimited expansions of the universe situated in one place although divided into many, many thousands.PURPORTThe word tatra (there) is very significant.

570,"To be in a relationship or not it's totally depend upon a person. Due to some circumstances, in life, there comes a time when you don't like such kind of things which hurt you in past.Right now after having 8 years of relationship you broke up and don't want to go for serious relationship again that's completely fine. It's nice to be single as you get more time to ponder about what you want in your life,once you're confirm about what you want in your life or how you want to spend your life then it's not a problem to be a single or mingle.Relationships comes with it's own set of responsibilities and after experiencing such a long time in one, it's quite hard to prepare yourself for the same.Relationships teach you a lot just accept the situation and move on but don't run away to be in a relationship. If you want to stay single all your life because of your past experience that is wrong just use it to make your life better.Thanks for A2A."
571,"Detailed Account of the UPSC Preparation from scratchI feel privileged today to share my two cents on civil services preparation. Before I begin let me clearly state that there is no magic wand to clear civil services. Also there is no correlation of intelligence and high aptitude with chances of selection in civil services. Most of the people who crack it are no indifferent (at one point of time even they were a part of the herd and felt the same uncertainty of clearing up this exam).But yes something worked for them, that made them successful.I would like to list down some of the most important components which you will find common in preparation of all successful candidates. We can call them as Basic Pillars of UPSC PreparationA timetable and strategy: Nothing is possible without proper planning, a daily timetable and short/long term goals setting. So plan and timetable is the first pillar.A strong foundation and conceptual clarity: it is important to ensure whatever we read, we understand it thoroughly. UPSC questions are very much applied, they need analysis and that can come only when we are crystal clear with our concepts of subject matter.Consolidation and revision: The syllabus is like a vast ocean, it is important to keep consolidating and revising it time and again. So make notes and continuously revise every now and then.Evaluation of Preparation: At every point of time you should know where your preparation stand, that is possible through self-evaluation and evaluation through tests.Consistency: Nothing happens without it. People who show consistency are sure shot to be rewarded, provided they work smartlyDiscussions and Answer writing: Discussions are very important, they will help in clearing your doubts & better understanding of subject matter. Similarly Answer writing has a very important role, knowledge without ability to express and articulate is futile. It is important to develop the ability to deliver in 8 minutes.Being Optimistic: This is the last but the most important one. UPSC is a time taking process, full of obstacles and failures. How to cope up with them, keeping yourself motivated is the biggest key to success.I will discuss each of the above point in detail sometime later. Also I shall take up discussion on soft aspects like right time to start preparation, should job be left, need of a backup, how do I decide why civil services etc. Clarity on all this is must before giving a full-fledged effort for preparation.Now let us discuss how to prepare for civil services.Pre ‚ÄìPreparation ModeThe initial two-three months are very confusing. People are generally not able to understand what to read, how to make notes, which newspaper to refer and other plethora of questions coming to their minds. What most people end up doing is they join a coaching thinking it to be a solution to all problems , others blindly start following some senior who himself is misdirected. This is a very crucial stage and I feel most of the people lose their momentum here because of a faulty start and they find very difficult to realign later.So starting has to be steady and sober. I think it is important to give at least two months to yourself to get yourself in UPSC mode. Start reading newspapers and noting them down, basic NCERT‚Äôs of economics, Polity & other basic ones, some good blogs/book etc. This will not only help in giving you a foundation but also help in taking informed decisions related to preparation (estimation of time you will need, need of coaching, should job be continued, optional choice etc.). This will act as a trial and error time where you can learn how to make notes, how to read books, learn from others etc. So this will make things smooth in your preparation be it self or through coaching.I shall discuss in detail how to go about in pre-preparation modePreparation ModeWhen you start your preparation, have..."
572,"25 Amazing Ancient Indian Inventions That Changed The World Today.India has to its credit one of the oldest civilization in the world. There are a lot of significant contributions that India has made to the world in the field of art, science, mathematics and so on. A lot of modern day inventions are based on the principals that were created in India right from the mythological age. Take a look at the amazing ancient Indian inventions that changed the world today.1. The number system was invented in India. Aryabhatta invented Zero.Buttonsimage sources 1, 2Buttons were first used in Mohenjo-daro for ornamental purpose rather than for fastening. They were first used in the Indus Valley Civilization by 2000 BCE.2. Chessimage sources 1, 2Chess developed out of Chaturanga, which is an ancient strategy board game developed during the Gupta Empire in India around the 6th century AD. Now you know why Vishwanathan Anand is such a pro, rag rag me is tarah‚Ä¶3. Prefabricated home and movable structureimage sourceIn 16th century Mughal India, during the reign of Akbar, the first prefabricated & movable structures were invented.4. RulerRulers were first used by the Indus Valley Civilization prior to 1500 BCE. Made of ivory, the rulers found during excavation, reveal the amazing accuracy of decimal subdivisions on it.5. Shampooimage sourceThe word ‚ÄòShampoo‚Äô is derived from chƒÅmpo (‡§ö‡§æ‡§Å‡§™‡•ã). It was initially used as a head massage oil for the Nawabs of Bengal during the Mughal Empire around 1762. It evolved into shampoo over the years.6. Snakes and Laddersimage sourceThe game, Snakes & Ladders, was invented in India as a game of morals. Later it spread to England and eventually introduced in the USA by game pioneer Milton Bradley in 1943.7. Cotton cultivation (We clothed the world, yay!)The ancient Greeks used to wear animal skins and were not even aware of cotton. But Indians were sort of cooland started cultivating cotton during the 5th ‚Äì 4th millennium BCE in the Indus Valley Civilization. The word spread to the Mediterranean and beyond and soon everyone was ordering one from Flipkart. Well, pretty much.8. Fibonacci NumbersThe Fibonacci numbers were first described by Virahanka, Gopala andHemachandra as an outgrowth of earlier writings by Pingala.9. Decimal System, Quadratic formula and Zero!It was in 7th century CE when Brahmagupta found the first general formula for solving quadratic equations. The decimal system (or the Hindu number system), which was a precursor of the Arabic numeric system, was developed in India between the 1st and 6th centuries CE.10. Suits GameThe popular game of cards originated from India & was known as Krida-patram (which literally means ‚Äúpainted rags for playing‚Äù).11. Cataract Surgeryimage sourceIndian physician Sushruta (6th century BCE) had the knowledge of performing cataract surgery. It spread to China from India. Greek scientists would visit India to get operations done and also to learn the nitty-gritties.12. Diamond MiningWorldwide, India was the only source of diamonds until the discovery of mines in Brazil in the 18th century. Almost 5000 years ago, diamonds were first recognized and mined in central India.13. Water on Moonimage sourceISRO‚Äôs Chandrayaan-1 made the startling discovery that our moon is not a dry ball of rocks. The discovery of lunar water is attributed to the Chandrayaan mission.14. Radio/Wireless communicationimage sourceWe all know that Marconi received a Nobel Prize in Physics in 1909 for contribution to the development of wireless telegraphy. But the first public demonstration of radio waves for communication was made by Sir Jagdish Chandra Bose in 1895, two years prior to Marconi‚Äôs similar demonstration in England.Sir Bose was posthumously credited (more than a century later) for his achievement. The fact remains that this discovery truly shaped the face of modern wireless communicatio..."

574,"Why do some people believe that life ends at death?I am a former Baptist raised in a fundamentalist household but I am now an atheist and I fall into that category of ‚Äúsome people‚Äù because I believe that death is the end of life.Why?It wasn‚Äôt a matter of being an atheist. I know of several atheists who believe in life after death and for a while, I held it as a possibility. But I like to read and before the days of Google and Wikipedia, I would sometimes go to public libraries and graze in their aisles. One day I happened upon a medical book that had an article about a man named Phineas Gage. Gage was born in 1823 and when he was 25 years old he worked in railroad construction. This was in the heydays of John Henry, the Steel Driving Man of song, prior to the advent of steam powered drills. Gage was working on drilling holes in rock, filling them with black powder and then exploding the powder in order to break the rock. The ‚Äòsteel driving‚Äô part was a matter of using a sledge to poke a long pointed bar downward through the rock. Once that was done, the powder was poured in and the bar‚Äôs flat end was used to tamp down the powder. Gage had reached that point in the process when the bar struck a spark in the hole, effectively creating a cannon with a javelin-shaped projectile. Here‚Äôs Wikipedia‚Äôs illustration for what happened next:Gage was rushed to his rented room, basically to die.But against long odds, Gage survived and recovered.Before his accident Phineas Gage was considered personable and was generally well-liked. After the accident, as might be expected, today, anyway, Gage displayed changes to his personality. There seems to be some dispute about whether these changes were exaggerated after his death, but the changes were noted by doctors who examined him.Today, damage to a large portion of the brain is much more survivable and the effects are better understood. The brain is where our cognition, our mental functions occur. Who we are is based entirely in the brain. I was taught from an early age that a magical spirit invested people with their personality, their soul, but, like most of the fairytales told under the label of religion, I no longer believe that. I‚Äôve been told by religious believers that the brain isn‚Äôt really an organ of memory, abstraction, reason, emotion and every other aspect of human behavior, but that it is really a receiver or receptacle for the directing spirit that is actually the human being. But Gage and all the subsequent patients who have had their brains physically altered put the lie to that idea.There are volumes of data correlating brain function to human behavior and cognition. There is literally no reputable data in support of anything like a soul or spirit. In fact, the fundamental precept of ‚Äúspirit‚Äù and ‚Äúsoul‚Äù is that they are supernatural, not capable of being physically measured, tested or perceived in any scientific sense.So, no, the idea of an afterlife is not believable to me. I didn‚Äôt exist before I was born; I won‚Äôt exist after I die."

I can see timelines of individuals and businesses and when is the right time to make choices. I can ""hear"" information and ""know"" information. I can see energies, doorways, inter dimensions and spirits. I can move energy and shift energy in people and situations. I can raise or lower my own frequency or that of the frequency in a situation. I can feel and see energies (paranormal) in houses and land. I can clear and correct these energies.I believe everyone is created to be multi dimensional and have access to different layers of information. We aren't meant to be empowered.

You don't have time to develop your abilities if you are unwell or working all the time.I have spent years being made to feel small by a family that will never understand and a society that treats us as different and a novelty.

578,"Here are some things you need to do:1)Take regular breaks and do the most important tasks immediately after the breaksInstead of taking too much pressure and stress it is important to take short breaks. Play an instrument, listen to song, talk to friends or go for a nature walk. My personal advice: don‚Äôt get into social media or watching TV, they never really refresh you. And once you are back into your best mode after the break, do the most important and high on priority tasks first.2)Learn to say ‚ÄòNO‚ÄôRemember you can not do everything in the world. Politely refuse to accept additional tasks if you think that you‚Äôre already overloaded with work. Take a look at your ‚ÄòTo Do‚Äô list before agreeing to take on extra work.3)Schedule and Prioritize your Work tasks:All the tasks you do throughout the day should be divided and prioritzed into 4 quadrants.People who spend most of their time in Quadrant I usually have stressful lives. What they need to do is both important and urgent. They have to respond to tight deadlines, they need to solve crisis and have to put out fires constantly.People who spend most of their time in Quadrant III usually have a short term focus. They feel out of control every then and now and have a short attention span.The Quadrant IV is all about time wasters or activities that don't provide any value. Anything done abusively could enter this category too (TV, video games, internet surfing...).Quadrant II is THE quadrant where you want to spend more time. It is the quadrant of planning, preparation, balance and pro-activity. It helps you to be highly productive and your best self on important issues and dealing with important issues before these turn into URGENT.4)Focus and block out distractionWhen you work, there has to be only one thing in your mind: Your Work. Remember that everything else is secondary and can wait but the task in hand, won‚Äôt. Silent your phone, disconnect the internet and ask people not not to disturb you if need be. Also keep a tab of the time spent on each task.Best Regards!"
579,"Even though your question is vague without supporting details, I will attempt to answer it.Is there a particular reason for pursuing a Masters in Law?In my opinion evaluate the following while deciding on whether to or not to do LLM:Is it absolutely necessary to do masters to get an edge over other coworker and or competitors at work place? Well that completely depends on your place and country of practice. In some countries like UK, you would be better of doing LPC rather than LLM in order to get a decent start to your career.If your practice area is India, then you may not need LLM per se to excel in your career, that is if you are already working and growing in your law firm. Those times are gone when having a LLM from a foreign university would get you a start in a good law firm. Your experience and expertise would much rather do that for you. Having said it's pertinent to note that if you are doing more contentious work ie. practicing in Courts then LLM does not do any additional benefit apart from being another feather in your cap. It may hold some value incase you are working or planning on working in a corporate setup.However if you wish to enhance your knowledge and take a break/sabbatical at the same time from work then go for it. After all college time is always the best time !! Incase you make up your mind about pursuing a Masters degree in Law, choose your subject wisely. Do it in the subject you have already done extensive work and have fair knowledge. It's not recommended to do it in a completely new subject that may interest you. But that's my personal opinion.A Masters degree may be of value to your resume incase you wish to be a teacher in a law college.Hope this helps."
580,"He is the best candidate among the short listed four and is a continuity candidate.Few thoughts -Patel was the architect of RBI‚Äôs new inflation targeting regime and generally considered as hawkish as Rajan. Among the short listed, he was the most consistent supporter of using headline CPI as the nominal anchor. His appointment sends a clear signal that the current monetary policy regime will continue. Some weeks ago, Nomura in a research note[1] had published a ‚Äúcheat sheet‚Äù of monetary policy stances of the candidates from the then much larger short list -Patel has worked at both central and state government levels in several departmental areas ranging from civil aviation, pension, telecom, competition commission, state electricity board and of course RBI. Unlike Rajan who was a career academic with a brief stint in IMF, Patel also spent some time in Indian private sector (Reliance). These experiences can only be an advantage.Much had been made of Rajan‚Äôs academic background in Indian media. Patel obviously is not in that league. I am not sure it matters that much. After all Rajan was the first ex-academic central banker India had. There had been many other very effective central bank governors in many countries who were career central bankers. And bear in mind that Rajan is quite an exception. There aren‚Äôt many other Indians at that level that the government can hire as RBI governor. Take a look here, - Economist Rankings at IDEAS, Number of Citations the top 5% economics authors by number of citations. Several years out of academia, Rajan is still there. There are only a handful of Indians there and most of them working in completely different areas.Patel will probably be more ‚ÄúRBI governor like‚Äù. Unlike Rajan, he will not use the RBI governor post as a bully pulpit to talk about crony capitalism in India, electoral malpractices, corrupt corporate leaders etc etc. He will not be as much fun but this will probably get him an extension after three years. That will be good.It is not clear whether Patel will continue with current RBI policy on clearing up bad debt from state banks‚Äô books. During Rajan‚Äôs term RBI was very determined about that and the state banks had started showing quite an attitude change in recovering bad loans, pursuing defaulters etc. I never understood if it was mainly a Rajan project or had broad consensus within RBI.Footnotes[1] Your Raghuram Rajan potential successor cheat sheet"

582,"America‚Äôs interest in India was evident as early as 1942 when Roosevelt supported India‚Äôs independence movement. Though American contact at that time was minimal. Indian Foreign policy characterised by Non-Alignment, refrain from bloc politics, disarmament, anti-colonialism, world peace did not contribute to developing closeness with the USA after independence.Thus, the beginning of the relationship was shaky with series of disagreement on a wide range of issues like India opposed American act of establishing a military basis in Asia and particularly Indian ocean. India had reservations towards the containment policy which brought military aid to Pakistan. However, there were occasions of cooperation also for example- the Suez Canal crisis and the Laos neutralization. Economic relations were progressive where India received American aid. The USA also supported India during the border conflict with China in 1962. The power axis which developed after 1965 between China and Pakistan changed American equation towards India. India, on the other hand, continued to criticise American aggression in Vietnam. The bilateral relation further deteriorated with President Nixon‚Äôs rapprochement with PRC, the delays in shipment of Pl-480 and lack of long-term industrial investment in India. After the 1971 war, USA accepted India as a regional power.Economically an exception was made when USA sold ‚ÄòXMP 14‚Äô supercomputers to India during Rajiv Gandhi‚Äôs tenure. Lets look at what is this history of India-US relations and what might be the possible future of it.All you need to know about India ‚Äì US relations during 1990‚Äôs.After the end of cold war, India and USA had differences on various issues like NPT and CTBT. The Brown Amendment act of 1995 allowed the USA to supply Pakistan with military equipment worth $658 million dollars which included maritime, aircraft and missiles. The situation further complicated when China supplied N-11 missiles to Pakistan and USA did not apply sanctions on China for violating NTCR.The growing military collaboration between Indo-US nations started only after Prime Minister Rao negotiated a long-term collaboration. In 1996, Malabar series of joint naval exercises started in the Indian ocean. A defence policy group was established and India acknowledged American military‚Äôs presence in Diego Garcia and the Persian Gulf.Read more ‚Äì What Is India‚Äôs Role In Syrian Civil War?In the 1990s India‚Äôs liberalisation policy attracted American business and investment. It was followed by the signing of Indo-US commercial alliance 1995 where the USA declared India as an emerging market. In 2017, Indo-US trade was at 70 billion US dollar.The 1990s also witnessed India‚Äôs quest for nuclear supremacy and technology. The Pokhran ll Nuclear test in May 1998 brought the line of cooperation to a halt. It is after President Clinton‚Äôs visit to India that certain amount of sanctions were withdrawn and Indo-US vision document was inaugurated.India-US relations during 2001 and onwards:Indo-US relation entered a new phase in the post 9/11 era as military cooperation and strategic partnership started to gain momentum. Both the Vajpayee administration and Bush administration needs to be credited for achieving progress in bilateral relation, particularly in respect of next step in a strategic partnership which was an agreement signed in 2004 on technology and commerce. In 2002, USA strongly criticised Pakistan‚Äôs role in sponsoring cross-border terrorism in India. In 2005 George Bush hosted Prime Minister Singh in Washington DC and the 2 leaders announced the successful completion of next step in a strategic partnership. They also negotiated to cooperate in civil nuclear and space matters. Bush reciprocated the visit in 2006. It is in 2006 that India earned bipartisan support in US Congress for the Indo-US civilian nuclear deal.India-US relations during Prime Minister Singh‚Äôs tenure:With regard to Barack Obama and Manmohan Singh‚Äôs perceptions of bilateral relation, the following issues require special mention-In the initial years of Obama‚Äôs Presidency, the focus was upon ‚ÄòAF-PAK‚Äô policy which reinstated Pakistan as central to US strategy on counter-terrorism. In 2009, Prime Minister Singh visited USA and 28 areas of dialogues were identified including NSG membership and UN elections. President Obama returned the visit in 2010 where he primarily focused on counter-terrorism, intelligence, economy and education. The bone of contention in the relationship continued to be H‚Äì1B visas and the issue of outsourcing.In 2013, USA and India were lots in a dispute over diplomatic immunity and privilege. The incident involved the detention of Department Consulate General Devyani khobragade following a dispute domestic labour. She was arrested by the US State Department on an allegation of visa fraud. This brought the bilateral relation to a standstill until the time the issue was resolved.India-Us relations during Modi‚Äôs reign.In 2014, Prime Minister Modi visited the USA which was the result of lifting the de facto travel ban upon him post 2002 Godhra riots. Through the policy of rapprochement American administration gradually softened its position towards Narendra Modi during the election campaign and eventually after his victory. The visit involved multilateral compulsion like General assembly address, diaspora diplomacy and addressing US business community on MAKE IN INDIA policy. Modi invited Obama to be the chief guest on Republic Day in Jan 2015.Read more ‚Äì What Is The Conflict Between America And North Korea?This visit of Obama to India was the 2nd visit by the same President thus making exceptions in bilateral relation. During the visit hotline was established between the two, the strategic and commercial dialogue was launched, Indo-US defence partnership with the objective to condemn China in South China sea was designed. The 2 leaders met again on the sidelines of UNGA session 2015 and climate change summit in Paris. The defence and technology trade gained momentum by crossing over 14 million US dollar mark.Why improved Indo-US relations has become a priority during Modi‚Äôs reign ?Modi has revitalized the Indian economy and that requires boosting investment and manufacturing in India. The US is an important partner in this regard.India wants to develop defence relationship with the US as a way to procure technology that India lacks.Will India-US relations be further strengthened if Modi and trump meets ?Indo-US relationship achieved great heights with President Donald Trump keeping his electoral promise of being the ‚Äúbest friend of India‚Äù inside the white house. India was the only country in which the Trump administration came out with a 100-year plan. As Trump announced his South Asia policy giving India a key role in bringing peace in the war-torn nation. For the 1st time, a US President aligned himself with New Delhi‚Äôs position that terrorism originates from Pakistan. It is also for the 1st time that US has aligned itself with India‚Äôs position on OBOR of China.Read more ‚Äì Will Wuhan Summit Be A Breakthrough In Indo-China Relations?There are also some issues that the 2 sides need to work on like H-1B visas. The Modi government has taken up the issue with the Trump administration. Similarly, India refused to succumb to any pressure when it comes to the interest of its own people which was to be seen in the rec WTO talks. Another loss of consensus appeared when the USA withdrew itself from Paris Climate Change agreement. Trump‚Äôs decision to pull out from trans pacific partnership has worked in favour of India.What might be the future of India-US relations ?In strategic, political, security, defence and economic terms relations between India and US will continue in a positive direction under President Trump. Impact of USA‚Äôs relations with Pakistan may or may not affect India. As far as China is concerned it will remain an important factor in the Indo-US relations. The future of India-US relations lies in their capacity to a new quid pro quo.This article was orginally published on electiontamasha.inFollow www.electiontamasha.in for Indian political updates!"

584,"When you sleep, your brain is mostly occupied with decluttering , so your brain isn‚Äôt really in learning mode, so you are limited in the things you can actually learn during sleep.One thing is foreign languages. Studies show that if you play tapes or listen to foreign words when you sleep, your brain may absorb them. Germans who listened to Dutch while they slept and were later tested on some words did better with than those who did not listen to dutch.Another thing is musical skills. In one study, the study writers played and instructional tape from Guitar Hero over and over while people slept and it was found that those who heard the tape were able to play the melody better than those who did not.If you dream lucidly, you can learn a lot about yourself. Dreaming lucidly is when your body realizes that it is dreaming, and is able to control the dream. Analyzing your dreams can help you understand your motivations and also to face unresolved conflicts.You may be able to put a thought in your head before a dream, and if you dream lucidly, you may be able to find the answer to that question. New ideas can also arise during sleep. If there is a certain thing that you are having trouble with, focus on it intensely before sleep, you may wake up with the solution.I am going to send you link to some cool sleep products that you may like.Good luck and enjoy!All Products"

587,"In my personal experience, living standards are much better now than they were when I was a child. In the early 1970s not having central heating was common, even among the middle classes. Now, most houses have central heating or, at worst, storage heaters that work much better than they did in the 1970s, approximating to central heating.Michael Grainger says that the gap between rich and poor has got wider and that may be true but it's also irrelevant to the question. The fact is that everyone has got richer, regardless of whether or not the rich have got richer faster. There are also other contributions to living standards such as the availability and quality of healthcare. The NHS has definitely got better and as it's available to everyone, even the poorest benefit. Likewise, higher education is more widely available. OK, there are now university fees but they aren't up front and in reality they're only a psychological barrier.Then there's technology. There are now only 9000 households with a black & white TV. All the rest have colour. In 1970, colour had only been around for 3 years and most people had black & white TVs. Even the poorest have access to things like PVRs, mobile phones and microwave ovens. Video recorders were just becoming popular around 1980, a surprisingly low number of people had any kind of phone in 1970 (mobiles as we know them started in 1984) and the microwave was something people had seen on Tomorrow's World. Today, outside central London, most households have a car. In 1970, that was definitely not the case.Now to the point of comparison with Germany and France. I'm really not sure what the answer is. It's certainly so that over the past twenty-five years the UK economy has grown a bit faster than the French economy and over the past ten years, also a bit faster than the German economy. However, the effect on living standards is hard to gauge. All three countries are prosperous developed nations and all three have good living standards. I think each excels at something and each has a failing elsewhere. I think that the three countries are comparable but more or less inseparable in terms of living standards. For the most part, I think that was also true when I was a child."
588,"This question is kind of vague, so I‚Äôm not 100% sure how to answer it, but I‚Äôll assume you mean what can you do as an undergraduate to become a machine learning researcher.So here‚Äôs the breakdown:Coursework:As an undergraduate looking to get into the field of ML, I‚Äôd advise that you take as many ML related courses as possible. At my undergraduate university, that meant taking background courses like Linear Algebra and Probability and Statistics and then going onto advanced courses like ‚ÄúMachine Learning‚Äù, ‚ÄúAdvanced Machine Learning‚Äù, ‚ÄúComputational Learning Theory‚Äù, ‚ÄúArtificial Intelligence‚Äù, ‚ÄúNatural Language Processing, and ‚ÄúComputer Vision‚Äù. This will buff you up on the theoretics and background knowledge needed to advance any further.Research Assistant:The research assistant opportunities available obviously depend on your school, but most universities have undergraduates working with professors or graduate students on projects all the time. Do your research on what professors are doing what and see if you can work on something. This will give you a nice glimpse on whether research is for you and maybe even what topic interests you most.In case you‚Äôre wondering what being a research assistant encompasses, it depends on your background and the professor/grad student. If a professor thinks you‚Äôre competent enough, they might have you do some exciting stuff - but it could also mean being the programming implementor (which has its own set of positives, too). It really depends, but either way, I‚Äôd highly recommend you do this!Outside Learning:Take the initiative to learn things on your own (pertaining to machine learning, of course). For me, this meant reading a lot of papers or playing around with some of the built in Python modules. Learning beyond the traditional coursework offered by universities is a great attribute to have, so I highly recommend you do so!Hope this helps!"
589,"I believe we will have a much faster development cycle, more similar to the web but with the big advantage of not having to support many platforms.Things like Playgrounds and App Thinning are clear references to try to speed up the development and deploy process that was really slow in the past. Also, the fact of open source Swift 2.0 plus the similarities with Rust and Go is a bet to speed the evolution of the language so it can reach the point where Objective-C was after forty years in less time.One missing pice I expect to see in the near future is the ability to change a running program so the write-test-fix process were orders of magnitud faster. I'm thinking in a workflow like Bret Victor - Inventing on Principle describe where things happen right in the moment an idea appear, so you can play with your own ideas with instant feedback.Finally, the software technology is coming to a balance where old ideas and new experiences mix in a sweet spot, ancient things like lambdas (closures) and values types are the trending now so maybe we should look forward with an old lense to see the future.PD: Bret Victor, beast of burden"
590,"Well, I am 19, but I still feel I have figured out the answer to this question which I am going to share with you.First of all, speaking in a very discrete fashion, life makes no sense. We all will die one day (god forbid it, maybe this very moment) and would be just like before - nothing. It won‚Äôt matter if you lived the life of Elon Musk or some random dude (admitted, Elon has lots of problems of his own, but his life is idolised by the masses unlike yours and mine). So why make an effort for anything?Everyone among us does a variety of jobs/emotions everyday which you can classify as ‚ÄòI enjoy it‚Äô (eating, sleeping, partying, watching movies, etc.) and ‚ÄòI hate doing it‚Äô (studying for many, working, waking up to go to office, deadlines, accidental pains, loneliness, breakups, etc.).The quality of your life is determined by the sum total of above. Is the total number of things which you love doing more than those you hate? For most people this is not the case. They are too busy making both ends meet and making a secure future for themselves and their progeny. This is what makes them question their life. It is these people who feel life has no purpose mostly.So, were you better off if you weren‚Äôt created in the first place? Or you are better spending 80 years in the form of life where you would have to go through all these good and bad feelings and circumstances? This makes me wonder if life has no purpose at all. I mean, you are born, go through an education system for 20+ years (to fit in), and then do a job (and face lots of difficulties and failures in life), do the same with your kids, and eventually die. This makes me wonder if all this was a waste. But then, we get to experience so many good stuff in this journey (success, joy, travelling, knowledge, food, music, nature, etc.)So does life have a purpose?Depends on you. If you want to enjoy this beautiful gift and experience as many things as possible, do it now. Don‚Äôt wait for anything. You never know when you will die. You don‚Äôt want to regret not asking out that girl/ going for a trek/ learning the guitar/ completing your PhD in your afterlife (if it exists).If you are someone who is facing a lot of drudgery and all sorts of tragedies (true for most people at least in India and similar developing and underdeveloped nations. Believe it or not, poverty leads to lots of problems which leads to questioning the purpose of life.), then better try to find happiness in whatever you have, because a life without good things is worthless and a pain in the @$$. The quality of your life is more about your perception of it than what the society makes you believe. Even a person with no education, money or love can live happily. So why make it so bad? Enjoy it while you have it.The purpose of life - To live it in such a way that you don‚Äôt ask yourself this question when you die."
591,"Do you have any 'target' in particular? Or 'any IITian' will do?Okay, I'll answer for both. 1) A particular target.I assume that you know this target directly or through some mutual contacts. Either way, the path to victory is built by Zuckerburg. May be, just for this purpose. Who knows? Universe conspires. Anyway, steps:a) Befriend the target on FB.b) Make sure you have uploaded some really well photoshopped photos before messaging the target.c) Ask him any random thing. If you are not in college yet, ask him about JEE. If you are in college ask him about internship. In fact ask him any stupid shit on the planet. He will be happy to help. d) Don't overdo step (c) though. He might get bugged by a 'girl who just asks him questions.' Make sure conversation gets to non-academic, non-IIT topics soon. e) You wouldn't want your target to realise he's a 'target'. Take care of that.f) IITians have too much free time on their hands. And most of it is spent online. So be online all the time. Develop a really good facebook relationship.g) Next thing should be video chatting. Things become serious once you start video-chatting.h) Till this step, you are almost a 'potential'. Now to solidify things, ask him if you can attend his college fest. I have seen many romances blooming during those 4 days. e) If he agrees, celebrate girl. You have done 80% of the work right. Now go on and buy some really chic clothes.

May be make him something or plan a date or some other 'couply thing'.g) If he hasn't confessed his never-ending love by now, he's just an idiot. So, go ahead and do it yourself.i) 'Self five' yourself for getting an ""IITan"" as a boyfriend.2)Any IITian Well, I just realised there isn't much difference in the strategy for any IITan and particular target.But, in this case the trick is not to look weird.So dig up any contact whose second or third cousin is an¬† IITian, or whose ex-ex or ex's ex is an IITian, or who is a friend of a friend of a friend of an IITian. Don't loose hope even if there are six such 'friends' in the above sentence. Read about Six degrees of separation to keep the search going.Once you find that one 'IITian', make him a target and follow steps (a) to (i).You are Welcome!P. S. - This answer is written by assuming you are a 'non IITian GIRL' in search of an IITian who still is in college. For real world IITians, this may not apply.

596,"Stainless steel cooking pans with aluminum heat spreaders on their bottoms have been around for years, 50-60-70 I'm not sure. Cookingware made of stainless steel sandwiching aluminum are welded together through extraordinary high pressure rollers physically squeezing their disparate atoms into a molecular bond. Same premise as explosive welding, but easier, cheaper, and far more friendly on a production line, but limited in the size or thicknesses possible. Explosive welding really has no limit, it can combine aircraft carrier sized thick metal sheets.All-Clad is an example: There is also the friction welding of dissimilar metals, Al and steel included, and the more recent friction stir welding technique.Here is just one of many stir welding examples: Honda develops new technology to weld steel and aluminum togetherI suspect that we will soon see extremely fast pulsed lasers welding dissimilar metals and other materials together. There are now lasers with pulse periods in the trillionths of a second, and materials behave completely differently under these conditions. I am sure some interesting new welding techniques will be a byproduct of these pico and nano pulsed lasers."
597,"Forget the other answers. I tested this before starting my Invention Therapy Youtube Channel and know why. If you pay for Youtube likes they run a script that doesn‚Äôt even check the total number of views and then the counter freezes and they keep adding likes! That‚Äôs how a channel gets more likes than views.The funny part is that views haven‚Äôt counted for anything since before 2013!This is all you need to know about views and subscribers.I have this tip and many more on my Invention Therapy Youtube Channel.Tip#1: Only your ego cares about views!Tip #2: Don‚Äôt buy subscribers or views from anyone!I have tested this. It will ruin your channel and make it hard to recover from the damage. Buying subscribers does not work with the new Youtube algorithm.Views do not help your channel in any way.Tip#3: Watch time is all Youtube cares about.These people selling subscribers and views are scammers! The accounts will eventually get deleted by Youtube and your subscriber count will go down!!!Youtube doesn‚Äôt even care how many subscribers you have at this point. In fact, if you buy subscribers, it will change the dynamics of how viewers watch your channel. Suddenly, Youtube will think your channel is a gaming channel (most of the fake subs are gamers) and suggest your videos to people who are not interested or fake accounts that will eventually get deleted.When these accounts get deleted, your subscriber count will start going in reverse!Like many people have said here on Quora and on Youtube itself, view velocity, watch time and many other factors are all that is important.If you have good content like my Invention Therapy Channel, that just means people will watch your videos. The problem is that you need to drive viewers to your videos to increase watch time and view velocity. Otherwise it will just sit there and die because Youtube will think nobody is interested.Subscribe to Invention Therapy and get more answers like this all the time that will help you grow your Youtube subscriber count. Invention Therapy‚Äôs TV Show will help your turn invention ideas into a reality. It is also a great resource for learning how to increase your Youtube views the right way so you have a real channel worthy of the time and effort it takes to succeed now on Youtube.Real subscribers with interest in your topic will help drive view in the beginning and hopefully increase the view velocity over time but a video with no subscribers can achieve the same result.My Fidget Spinner Video is doing just fine and subscribers did nothing to help it.I hope you learned something from my answer.Richard"
598,"Not only for Sharif‚Äôs government,for any civilian government its impossible to resolve the Kashmir conflict.There are only two stake holders,one is the Indian government and the other one is Pakistani army.If any general of Pakistani army wholeheartedly wants to solve Kashmir conflict its easy,subjected to power and fandom he enjoys in Pakistan.For Indian government accepting LOC as permanent border with minor adjustments at strategic points is not that tough because historically Indian government favored status quo.Geographically its win-win for both the nations because neither of them has to lose territory as LOC is serving as de facto border for quite sometime. But morally Pakisthani army has everything to lose because they justified terror by pointing Kashmir and they lose sympathy in Kashmir.But this would become reality in coming because China is increasingly nervous about Investments in CPEC and its difficult to directly involve in security of the CPEC.China would definitely push Pakistan for this because they want hassle free CPEC corridor ."
599," This is a beautiful question, in a small part because it‚Äôs an interesting thought experiment with some clever math, but mostly because of all the reasons it couldn‚Äôt be done and wouldn‚Äôt work. Right off the bat; clearly a hole can‚Äôt be drilled through the Earth. By the time you‚Äôve gotten no more than 30 miles down (less than 0.4% of the way through) you‚Äôll find your tunnel filling will magma, which tends to gunk up drill bits (also melt everything).Jumping into a hole drilled through the Earth. What‚Äôs the worst that could happen?But! Assuming that wasn‚Äôt an issue, and you‚Äôve got a tube through the Earth (made of unobtainium or something), you still have to contend with the air in the tube. In addition to air-resistance, which on its own would drag you to a stop near the core, just having air in the tube would be really really fatal. The lower you are, the more air is above you, and the higher the pressure. The highest air pressure we see on the surface of the Earth is a little under 16 psi. But keep in mind that we only have about 100 km of real atmosphere above us, and most of that is pretty thin. If the air in the tube were to increase in pressure and temperature the way the atmosphere does, then you‚Äôd only have to drop around 50 km before the pressure in the tube was as high as the bottom of the ocean.Even worse, a big pile of air (like the atmosphere) is hotter at the bottom than at the top (hence all the snow on top of mountains). Temperature varies by about 10¬∞C per km or 30 ¬∞F per mile. So, by the time you‚Äôve fallen about 20 miles you‚Äôre really on fire a lot. After a few hundred miles (still a long way from the core) you can expect the air to be a ludicrously hot sorta-gas-sorta-fluid, eventually becoming a solid plug.But! Assuming that there‚Äôs no air in the tube, you‚Äôre still in trouble. If the Earth is rotating, then in short order you‚Äôd be ground against the walls of the tunnel, and would either be pulverized or would slow down and slide to rest near the center of the Earth. This is an effect of ‚Äúcoriolis forces‚Äù which show up whenever you try to describe things moving around on spinning things (like planets). To describe it accurately requires the use of angular momentum, but you can picture it pretty well in terms of ‚Äúhigher things move faster‚Äù. Because the Earth is turning, how fast you‚Äôre moving is proportional to your altitude. Normally this isn‚Äôt noticeable. For example, the top of a ten story building is moving about 0.001 mph faster than the ground (ever notice that?), so an object nudged off of the roof can expect to land about 1 millimeter off-target. But over large changes in altitude (and falling through the Earth counts) the effect is very noticeable: about halfway to the center of the Earth you‚Äôll find that you‚Äôre moving sideways about 1,500 mph faster than the walls of your tube, which is unhealthy.The farther from the center you are, the faster you‚Äôre moving.But! Assuming that you‚Äôve got some kind of a super-tube, that the inside of that tube is a vacuum, and that the Earth isn‚Äôt turning (and that there‚Äôs nothing else to worry about, like building up static electricity or some other unforeseen problem), then you would be free to fall all the way to the far side of the Earth. Once you got there, you would fall right through the Earth again, oscillating back and forth sinusoidally exactly like a bouncing spring or a clock pendulum. It would take you about 42 minutes to make the trip from one side of the Earth to the other.The clever math behind calculating how an object would fall through the Earth: As you fall all of the layers farther from the center than you cancel out, so you always seem to be falling as though you were on the the surface of a shrinking planet.What follows is interesting mostly to physics/engineering majors and to almost no one else.It turns out that spherically symmetric things, which includes things like the Earth, have a cute property: the gravity at any point only depends on the amount of matter below you, and not at all on the amount of matter above you. There are a couple of ways to show this, but since it was done before (with pictures!), take it as read. So, as you fall in all of the layers above you can be ignored (as far as gravity is concerned), and it ‚Äúfeels‚Äù as though you‚Äôre always falling right next to the surface of a progressively smaller and smaller planet. This, by the way, is just another reason why the exact center of the Earth is in free-fall.The force of gravity is , where M is the big mass, and m is the smaller, falling mass. But, since you only have to consider the mass below you, then if the Earth has a fixed density (it doesn‚Äôt, but if it did) then you could say , where œÅ is the density. So, as you‚Äôre falling .Holy crap! This is the (in)famous spring equation, F = ‚Äì kx! Physicists get very excited when they see this because it‚Äôs one of, like, 3 questions that can be exactly answered (seriously). In this case that answer is , where R is the radius of the Earth, and t is how long you‚Äôve been falling. Cosine, it‚Äôs worth pointing out, is sinusoidal.Interesting fun-fact: the time it takes to oscillate back-and-forth through a planet is dependent only on the density of that planet and not on the size!"
600,"Planting a garden. Yes, you have to work for it but you are using your energy to collect the only free energy known, that of the sun. It is not free if you collect it via a solar panel, you can't store it without using energy from other sources that are not free and even then the storage time and capacity are limited.Some will suggest that wind, tidal and water flow provide free energy. What energy they have is tied back to that same sun and none of it can be harvested for free. Even solar, if it is to be used for anything beyond gardening, will not be free. Solar oven? You have to create the oven and for any effective use, the material required will need other energy for manufacture. The same basic problem lies at the beginning of any energy use effort.Still, planting fruits and vegetables, especially those better eaten raw, is the only ‚Äúfree‚Äù energy for you.

603,"Genotype and Phenotype are terms that come under the study of genetics. When comparing offsprings of reproduction (i.e: when a new generation is produced by mating) their characteristics can be compared in two ways.1. According to their generic composition2. According to how they look (i.e: according to what changes are observed due to the difference in genetic composition)This (2.) is known as the 'Phenotype' of an organism.All in all, Phenotype is the exhibited genetic character of a gene of an organism. So, a phenotype ratio is the ratio of comparison of these exhibited characteristics.Example:If red colour and white colour are phenotypes of the colour of a flower with genotypes RR and rr respectively, with R representing the dominant allele and r representing the recessive allele, Rr will also be red in colour.(Don't confuse yourself if you aren't familiar with this yet. This is another section of genetics.)Then, the phenotype ratio of the genotypeRR - 1Rr - 2rr - 1will be,Red : White = 3 : 1"

605,"Making names and fame in Bollywood is not so easy. It is time to get up from the ground and touch the sky. There are many actors in Bollywood who are today among the brightest stars of Bollywood on their own. The hard work behind their shine is that they are shining brightly. Today, we are going to talk of an actor who is counted among the richest Bollywood industry.(1). Shahrukh Khan, who is known as the King of Bollywood, during the IPL, his team flies to watch the match of Kolkata Knight Rider, in which he uses his private jet. This is a great actor. His films earn a lot of money. His hard work today appears in his work, name and status. Today we are talking about Bollywood's King Khan is known today as a successful actor after hard work in the Bollywood industry. Regarding the journey from Delhi to Mumbai, you all know that the journey of Bollywood from Delhi in the evening is so confusing that no one is unaware of it. Shahrukh Khan, who started with a small serial on the small screen since 1989, is on Bollywood bigwigs today. Bollywood started her film career in 1992 in the movie Deewana. As you all know, in the early days of Bollywood's journey, Shah Rukh Khan's films were seen in the role of a villain, such as Bajiigar, Later, gradually the image of Shah Rukh Khan came to prominence as a romantic hero and in Bollywood he is known as the romance king. At one time, King Khan, that is, Shah Rukh Khan was considered to be the top of the list of the world's top 5 expensive stars. In films, he went slowly to his famous characters, and Bollywood got a great star, who spread romance all over the world with his performance. Shahrukh has become a brand not only in the bollywood industry but also for the whole world. Today, he is counted among Bollywood's richest actors. As long as we do not become something, we do not even have the power of time.Do you know that for the sake of saving his precious time, SRK has reached the time to complete any of his work on time, that too from his personal plane. Yes, Shahrukh has so much money today that he has bought his own personal plane and now wherever he goes he goes through his plane. Do you know that Shahrukh Khan House earns more than Rs. 270 crore?Apart from acting in films, he has her own production house named Red Chile Entertainment.Apart from this, you must know all his team in the IPL. Yes, Kolkata Knight Riders is a team of Shah Rukh Khan. This can be gauged from the fact that how rich they will be today. On his big screen, his forthcoming film is about to release the same Ziro, which is eagerly waiting for the audience. There is no doubt that a movie of Shahrukh Khan that is not a hit.There are many Bollywood actors who have their own jets. I didn't define much about those persons that if I define then it is quite long. You all are feeling bored.

606,"The fundamental differences between in ear-phones and over the ear-phones are:The size of the driver within the housing,The isolation from the outside noise.Generally speaking a well fitted in ear-phone will give a slightly better isolation from the outside world which means less interference from other sounds which allows you to hear your choice of music or spoken word entertainment better. However, an over the ear-phone will give a broader frequency response which translates into lower/warmer lows and higher/crisper highs.The Bose over the ear-phones would tend to offer noise cancellation. A small microphone on the outside of the housing listens to the surrounding noise and with some clever electronics will reverse the phase of the noise will cancel out any outside noise you will hear with your ear giving you a sense of isolation and generally a better music experience.The quieter you can afford to keep your in-ear phones or over the ear-phones the better it is for your ears/hearing, isolation or noise cancellation will facilitate this.The key is to know the purpose of use and this will generally guide you to the product that will perform best for you."
607,"Bear with me because 10 is a very large number for a list! As a film fanatic, you‚Äôd want a variety of movies to watch of different genres incorporating the many different types of techniques to showcase a movie! Without further ado, a list of movies you must watch as a film fanatic:Citizen Kane (1941) : Often hailed as the best movie ever made, this is a movie you MUST watch if you‚Äôre a film fanatic. Orson Welles was a pioneer of filming and created many amazing techniques that were revolutionary for his time! A great start on your journey.Psycho (1960): Alfred Hitchcock, along with Welles, is among the pioneers of early filmmaking! This movie was considered a controversy at the time of its release because of it‚Äôs unique story line that killed off the main character! Also, the ending caused the American audience to develop a love for thrillers!2001: A Space Odyssey (1968): No list is complete without adding the genius, Stanley Kubrick. I could‚Äôve chosen any of his movies, but I‚Äôve chosen this because of his usage of visual cues. Although made in 1968, it‚Äôs amazing visual effects transcend movies released decades later!The Gold Rush (1925): One of the earliest forms of comedy movie, Charlie Chaplin at his finest. Absolute genius of an artist and it‚Äôs hilarity still ensues to this day! Not only was he a director, but he was also the actor!‚ÄòThe Shining‚Äô (1980): One of the greatest horror movies ever created. Not only is it bewilderingly scary, but the plot is riveting, acting amazing, and once again, great usage of technology at the time. Stanley Kubrick is a wonderful director to study!‚ÄòThe Godfather‚Äô (1972): Another classic movie that is a must-watch! This movie is highly influential in the movie industry. And is often a reference for many gangster related movies! Amazing movie to watch and heart thumping with each death!‚ÄòDo the Right Thing‚Äô (1989): One of the best Spike Lee films, it‚Äôs a movie that delves into race. Very important topic to watch because all cultures offer different aspects to movie-making! Thought this was one of the best movies made by Lee before he went too artistic!‚ÄòSaving Private Ryan‚Äô (1998): One of the greatest war movies, it‚Äôs action-packed and filled with many emotional journeys. This is one of the best action movies ever created and you will be at the edge of your seat as you watch this movie! Also, the acting and the cinematography is amazing in this movie. Truly fits the atmosphere of war.‚ÄòLion King‚Äô (1994): One of the best, if not, the best, animated movie ever made, this is one for all ages. You can learn so much from this film, especially music and its importance. One of the most recognized soundtracks and has amazing artwork for the landscape. Story line is one of the easiest to follow and fall in love with.‚ÄòEternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind‚Äô (2004): One word: screenplay. Has the most amazing lines in any movies. Due to Charlie Kaufman being its screenplay writer, this movie‚Äôs lines can easily make you cry!I‚Äôm sure there are plenty more, but I personally believe a these movies are the cornerstones of any film-watchers!"
608,"Here is the state of the world now (only highlights).North Korea- Has missiles and Nukes in its stockpile. Their missiles do not have enough range to reach continental US. Even if they somehow manage to strike a few Nukes at the US, it will only affect the impact zones immediately. So it will result in the total wipe out of NK in the US‚Äôs retaliation. North does not want to nuke the south coz their first goal is to take over the south and unite the Koreas. It does not want to attack any of its neighbors simply because there are no compelling reasons to do so for North. So there‚Äôs no real threat.Russia- She has a lot of technologically advanced weapons. Some even better than the US. She has a stock pile of Nukes and intercontinental ballistic missiles. But they have one thing working against them. Their own economy. Their economy is weak. They cannot keep the supplies alive to support an all out war or an invasion. No place can be dominated or occupied without boots on the ground. So there‚Äôs no real threat.China- She has the largest army. Lot of hardware, strong economy, many missiles and long history as well. What is working against them is their size and their political leadership. Most of the weapons in their arsenal are old and reverse engineered stuff from the Soviet era. They are modernizing however, but not at the rates they want. Also their navy and air force does not have enough hardware to back an invasion. So no real threat.India- Certainly a large number of people, large army. Relatively modern Air force and Navy. India is historically peaceful and non-aggressive they have stood their ground against aggressors but never pushed back. Also the air force does not have the infrastructure to support an invasion. Navy has inadequate number of modern vessels. Submarine fleet is aging. Modernization is happening at a snail‚Äôs pace. Political leadership is not helping with the process either. So no real threat.Europe- Collectively, very powerful and has strategic advantage over the rest of the world due to sheer strength and size of hardware of individual members and the collective strategic knowledge and experience. However, Europe is not as united as they wish to be. Member nations have trust issues with each other due to leftover emotions from previous two world wars. Also there is an impending financial crisis and a social crisis due to the refugee movement. So no real threat.Africa-Individual nations(some of them) may be strong enough to defend own territories against invaders, however none of the African nations are strong enough to launch a war or an invasion against even their Asian neighbors; let alone European or American. Also, most of the continent is torn apart by countless civil wars, racial and tribal conflicts and regional disputes. There is not enough reasons for an outward spill-over of the conflicts. So no real threat.South America- Same as Africa. Third world countries, slow or crippled economies, poverty, smaller, largely inadequate military forces. There are no compelling reasons for them to cause a large scale conflict, let alone global. So no real threat.Middle East- There are a few who can put up a real tough fight against an invading foreign military.Their situational awareness, familiarity with terrain and guerrilla tactics are all advantageous but only works withing the region so they are only good at defense. Certain countries possess good hardware and moderately large modern armed forces. However, none of the Middle Eastern countries possess the military strength to lead an invasion on foreign land or sustain the defense of their own territories for a long time (including Iran). Also they are not synonymous with the modern equipment that they possess. This is because of lack of experience in large scale multi-face, multi-theater warfare and lack of trust between troops. This seriously undermines the collective efforts. So no real threat.Last but not least,USA- Uncle Sam checks off all items on the list when it comes to size, numbers and weaponry. Certainly strong, economy wise. Has a global reach and has lead countless invasions, successfully. They are already the dominating force and has a firm hand of control over the world with many military bases in strategic locations across the entire planet. She is ruling the world now, at least by a big margin (Economically, politically and strategically). So she wouldn‚Äôt do anything that would start a third world war and cause a global meltdown. Because once the world goes in to the chaos of war, the balance of power might tip against them. Off course she will get involved in many other small scale conflicts, trying to bring down a dictatorship or install a new one, home-delivering freedom and democracy to the needful. Still, no real threat.Unless something dramatic plays out anytime soon or some nut job decides to let some nukes loose willy-nilly, we are certainly not heading towards a third world war. So just relax and have a cold beer."
609,"I‚Äôve edited my answer from another, similar, question to provide you with my professional advice:Constipation in the western world is common because we eat lousy food. The western diet is lacking in fiber and nutrients and loaded with heavily processed ingredients and empty calories. In addition, many medications have constipation as a side effect. Lack of exercise will slow your body‚Äôs natural ability to move things alomg. There are certainly other causes, like IBS and microscopic colitis, but in the absence of other etiology, diet and/or medications are the likely culprit.Treating the condition is usually uncomplicated but maintaining bowel health can be a fine line between ‚Äújust right‚Äù and explosive, unpredictable, and potentially embarrassing diarrhea. First things first: look at your diet and see if you‚Äôre taking in enough fiber. Plant-based, minimally processed foods like veggies, fruits, whole-grain bread, and beans are good sources of fiber. Drink plenty of fluids, preferably water. Caffeine can cause constipation. Artificial sweeteners just aren‚Äôt healthy. Too much sugar isn‚Äôt healthy either.If your diet is the problem then you should change your eating habits. Also look at whether you are chewing your food well enough. Gulping down mouthfuls of poorly chewed food means your gut needs to work harder to break it down. Another western-world phenomenon‚Äî-eating on the run.For immediate relief you can try a dose of bisacodyl, which is an OTC treatment for constipation. It‚Äôs available as a rectal suppository, or as an enema, which both work pretty quickly. The drug is available in tablet form, but it doesn‚Äôt work as quickly. Milk of Magnesia is effective overnight, usually. Caveat: you can become dependent on laxatives, so use them judiciously.I work with old folks who frequently have constipation, so we work hard to prevent it. One of the best bowel-maintenance products out there is Miralax. Take it every day and you should be good. Senna is effective for some people but it can cause diarrhea; conversely, without enough fluids, it can cause constipation. Docusate is another OTC that helps as it ‚Äúsoftens‚Äù stool.

610,"Yep.It was in Class 8. I knew she hated me. I didn't exactly do anything to make her like me, you know? But the level of hatred wasn't warranted. She insulted my parents for no reason. Imagine what that's like for a 12 year old. You look up to those people! You wanna be just like them.Then a guy went and told her that I called her crazy. She didn't know if he was right. She probably didn't care. Well, she obviously didn't care. If she had cared, she wouldn't have done what she did.So she comes out of the art room, because I was standing outside in punishment. I hadn't brought my art kit for years. I was too lazy to try and catch up at this point. She says,‚ÄúPagal bola?! Hain?! Pagal bola?!?!‚Äù*WHACK*At the time, I thought my jaw dislocated. It hurt. I cried a bit. At the end of the class, I was called inside,‚ÄúAww, come here. Why are you crying?‚ÄùMe: Har hafte teri shakal dekhni padegi to koi royega nahi to kya karega? Haan maine keh diya!(What else is one supposed to do if they have to see your face every week? Yes, I said that.)After that, I walked out. In the past half hour, that woman had insulted my parents (and my entire family), hit me just because another person gave her an excuse, and then she tries to portray herself as a motherly figure.(OMG, I just described Umbridge! Holy crap, she was like Umbridge! Did Umbridge get banished from the wizarding world? That would explain why she was so cranky all the time. I'm sending this to my classmates! They'll love this!)I think the only reason she did that was because no one saw her slap me except a few students (i.e., the ones who complained). The class had heard her bad mouthing my parents.I don't remember how many students were there. Apparently, enough that it spread to a few other classes.A few days later while commuting to school, a girl my age tells the younger kids,‚ÄúYou guys just say those things to her. You don't know how much guts she has. Do you know what she said to a teacher?‚ÄùI did not know how fast news could travel. I didn't even know that it was something noteworthy or positive to talk back (even in self-defence). I was just mad because of the injustice of it all. I didn't think she's just believe anything she heard. If your teacher can't be well-mannered, why should you?My parents didn't mind the insult. So they let it go. They were like,‚ÄúDidn't you tell her that your parents have a better job than her? Lol.‚ÄùMy better was the must indignant,‚ÄúDidn't you tell her ‚ÄòMa‚Äôam, you have no right to touch me like that?‚Äô‚Äù I was surprised. Bro, you know our Mom thinks hitting the kids is a legal right, right? I was used to it, at the time. (That's another story.)We all just kind of rolled our eyes and went on with life. I had to attend another art class. She told me to stand outside, ‚ÄúIn front of the camera.‚ÄùIf that camera worked, it carptured her slapping me. Evidence! :)The best part:After the incident, the boys in my class stopped playing catch with my possessions. So that went well. Had I known that all it takes is yelling at a teacher, I would have done it 5 years earlier.Thanks for the request, it's one of my fond memories :)"
611,"Yes. A lot of people would answer otherwise according to their misguided belief that war destroys. That may be true but it also creates as well. During WW2, technological advances in weaponry and manufacturing were only possible due to the desperate total war scenario provided by the situation. The Russians perfected the art of the mass mobilization because of the do or die scenario presented by the advance of the Werhmacht. The world wouldn't have acquired the idea and model of the assault rifle as early as we did had the need to clear houses with the efficiency of a submarine gun, but with the power of a bolt action rifle been a necessity of the conquests of the Third Reich. Tanks wouldn't look the same and wouldn't be NEARLY as advanced as they are today had Hitler just settled for Danzig and nothing more. Slanted armor is a predictable innovation and would have most likely been implemented in the same time frame, however the innovations of much larger AT guns being mounted on top of tank chassis would not have been useful for at least another 2 decades. I believe that thou infrastructure and land development was set back 20 years in Europe. Technological innovation was jolted forward 20. Whether we as a race come out of that better or not is left entirely to the reader. We won some and we lost some. I'm not here to tell you how to think or feel but rather to give you information so you can form your own opinion. Would you trade those 60 million people for what we gained as a race consequently?

616,"It depends on why you were denied entry. If it's because you don't have proper documentation (passport and visa, etc), then the airline is liable for allowing you to fly without the proper papers, and therefore they have to cover all fines and costs to return you home.However, if you have proper documentation but are denied for another reason (like a criminal record), the airline is still liable to get you home (or to somewhere else), but will try to get the money from you somehow. For example, they may use your existing return ticket towards your new ticket, or ask you to pay any difference, or use any legal means to get the money for the fines from you later. It would be up to the airline if they want to bother."

I guess its a tradition they carried from India.Uneducated womenI am not saying most Pakistani women are uneducated but its very common. Girls from affluent families make it to a lavish life but in the little towns, villages and remote areas its a struggle.A must watch movie, Dukhtar that one must see the struggle of a mother. Even though Islam says a woman must get as much education she wants.Muslim brotherhood shamAs much as the whole of Pakistan claims that they are muslims casteism, regionalism runs very very strong in them. They are even more divided than us Hindus actually.Thats when Muslims tell me I follow casteism I tell them how come you claim you dont.Till humanity exists there will always be discrimination.Double standardsWhen their girls are in Pakistan this is how they liveBut when the same girls go abroadThey live like this. I dont understand who is a real muslim then?While guys like to live like this. They love to be hip but women must be covered back home and I have seen educated men with women dressed like Halloween.SecularismThe picture tells the story: Don‚Äôt worry the truly secular nation Canada is giving her an asylum.Double facedThey talk about liberation of Kashmir but actually want it to become a part of it.

620,"I think the word ‚Äúbest‚Äù is too loaded a term, but if I were to answer, what single work of music is perhaps the greatest cultural product of a single mind? Then I would have to answer, no contest, Beethoven's Symphony No. 9 in D Minor, known also as the Choral Symphony.Sure, it's very popularity can be a negative, as it seems almost clich√© to cite this work, but nothing else, in my estimation, achieves what Beethoven manages to achieve here: through sheer force of will (or maybe he was just paying attention), he manages to claw his way up to catch a glimpse of Heaven, then shares with us what he saw.Some might disagree with me, citing Beethoven's mighty Fifth Symphony, an astounding work of unsurpassed originality. But the Fifth only really achieves greatness in its first movement; while the third is delicious, and the fourth a compelling and triumphant ending to the work, they are not at the same level (and the second movement‚Ä¶ never been a huge fan).In the 9th Symphony, we are treated to four remarkable movements, united by an overarching story line about the evolution of humanity. Which is why, in the fourth movement, Beethoven recalls the themes of each of the preceding three movements, only to have the basses, the voice of God, reject each as inadequate to the task. Instead, the Ode to Joy theme is introduced, first by the basses, then with the other lower strings (and the loveliest bassoon counterpoint ever written), then the full strings, then the full orchestra, with timpanis pounding and French horns blaring (the sure sign that Beethoven is happy)‚Äîto my mind and my ear, the most emotionally moving development of a musical idea you're ever going to find, triumph written large.Beethoven then introduces a human voice‚Äîthe first for a symphony‚Äîwhich leads ultimately to the full chorus, which is followed by a Turkish-inspired march and a thrilling passage of musical development, leading to the coda and the full-throated singing of the Ode to Joy theme.And then something remarkable happens. Beethoven breaks with the classical structure that, however stretched, still gave form to this work, and enters into some of the most emotionally moving music ever composed, a plea to all of us to question what we know and seek our Creator beyond the canopy of stars. Though other composers had begun writing in the form we know today as Romantic, the abrupt shift in the music here is the visible, visceral break, the end of the Classical, and the emergence of the Romantic.There's more to it, of course, but in the end there is no musical ride that compares with this one. Sure, works written in the two centuries since have built on and far exceeded many aspects of what Beethoven composed, but these works stand on the shoulders of giants, and in particular a grumpy, grouchy, deaf guy who achieved the near impossible. It is for this reason that I say that classical composers may be properly understood to fall into two groups: Beethoven, and everyone else."
621,"Singapore means Lion City. You can or not believe whether there have ever been lions leaving on one of 63 Singapore's islands. You might also argue whether or not there is a true democratic system present in the Republik Singapura. What is not arguable, however, is the fact that Singapore's people have built, literally from scratch, one of the most exciting and successful Country in the World.The Garden City's modern history is not only exiting but paradoxical as well. Firstly, Singapore obtained its independence (9 August 1965) not as a result of revolutionary war, a military coup or, at best, as a gift from a dissolute foreign power (as it had been the case with all other former colonies elsewhere), but as the punishment. Secondly, Singapore has possessed none mineral resources whatsoever. Thirdly, Singapore didn't have an unifying ideology, religion or a sense of national identity to lay into the foundation of the new society.Moreover, at a time it appeared that the national identity was completely taken away by Malaysian Parliament voting 126-0 to expel Singapore from its realm. The reason for that decision was rising suspicions that People's Action Party (PAP, the major political party of Singapore) has a powerful communist lobby inside it. Lee Kuan Yew (an architect of Singapore's miracle) even stated on the television conference: ""For me, it is a moment of anguish."". In only 50 years the Red Dot has became one of the wealthiest country on Earth.Singapore today is the darling of economists and a contentious point in discussions between proponents of classical democratic principles and supporters of ""guided democracies"".Officially, the city-state is a parliamentary democracy with the Prime Minister and its Cabinet members appointed by the President which is elected by popular vote. Singapore Parliament has 84 members which are also selected on general elections. There is a multi-party system in Singapore with such parties as Parti Pekerja Singapura (Workers' Party, left) or Singapore People's Party (SPP, center) competing on general election with PAP. However, on each elections since 1966 PAP has came as an absolute winner with 60 or more percents of the votes and 80 or more seats in the Parliament.International human rights organizations including Amnesty International or Reporters Sans Frontieres often point to an absence of basics freedoms in Singapore including freedom of press or freedom of assembly. At the same time, Singapore consistently ranks highest as the least corrupt and the most suitable for business country in the World.Instead of pumping oil, gold, diamond or exploiting offshore bankings as do other small but prosperous countries, The Red Dot used its strategic position near Southeast Asia's trade lines to convert itself into the giant finance, technology and commodity hub. The rule of law, comprehensive business regulations, political stability and openness to innovations have transformed the Garden City from small and dirty sea port into the World's leader by the number of millionaires (every six of Singaporean reported to possess more than $1 million of disposable assets).On the downside, being highly dependent on the state of international trade and finance, Singapore remains sensitive to the World's economic cycles. Reflecting the recent Worldwide economic slowdown, city-state's GDP growth rate has been sliding from almost 40% in 2010 to almost 0% today. At the same time, low unemployment rate (2%) and rising deflationary pressure (from 6% in 2012 to -2% in 2016) suppress investments into Singapore future developments.The Lion City - the wonder of World's economy in 80s, 90s and 2000s - is today in a growing jeopardy. However, it still presents itself a wonderful illustration of unprecedented social and economic progresses achieved in a lifetime of one generation."

623,"I might make an exception for merely confirming the end of a temporary assignment, but in the vast majority of cases, NO.It's not illegal, but it is disrespectful, cowardly, unprofessional, and increases the likelihood that the exiting employee will bring a claim against the company arising from some real or imagined adverse condition relating to their employment. They are also more likely to disparage the company to others (often, but not always, using accurate information), contact customers and employees to encourage them to consider leaving, and take other actions that may damage the company's reputation as an employer and as a business. Some of these actions may be unlawful, at least in part, but that doesn't mean that the damage isn't real.There are some occasions when following up via email might make sense, especially if the employee is being provided with advance notice of their final day of employment (as may be the case if they are temporary employees at the end of an assignment, for example), but only after the employee has been notified in person."

626,"I would like to complement Maya Las answer with some information about the situation in Sweden. First hand information.In my city, Sundsvall, we have a refugee camp that has been around for 35 years. It is quite OK. It is an old mental hospital that was closed down when moden psykofarma made it obsolete. Refugees lives in apartments of several rooms, used to be one refugee in every room and a shared kitchen. Low standard but much higher than anything offered to swedish military conscripts. Then in 2011 the Swedish government made an agreement with Milj√∂partiet that ment:All refugees that claimed to be from Syria were to be granted asylum Any refugee that claimed to be a child was to be considered a childRefugees that was denied asylum were to be allowed to stay in refugeecamps and be granteed housing, food and pocket money until they decided to leave.This agreement had consequencies that no one could have predicted (source: the Swedish government). For example: our refugeecamps were crowded. New refugeecamps were established. We runned out of abandoned military baracks and mental hospitals. Other abandoned buildings had to be used. This ment that refugees were housed in of side buildings with low standards. Sweden has a lot of empty space but it is uninhabitated by a reason (think Siberia).Many refugees are now very disapointed when they are housed in abondoned buildings in the middle of nowhere. In Timr√• there are some military baracks indended for temporary use were refugees are housed. The refugees have been protesting against living there.Then when we runned out of baracks in the forrest new alternatives had to be found. In Sundsvall we now have refugees living in sports hall. Sleeping on the floors. The situation is creating problems. Different refugees are mixed and conflicts occures. Imagining Shia muslims and Sunni muslims living together. People are being killed and raped. This could also not have been predicted: When arriving to Sweden all refugees were supposted to end their conflicts and live in peace and harmony in Sweden (why dont they just shake hands?)Some refugees are also very disapointed and refuse to leave their buss when arriving to the new low standard refugeecamps. This is very chocking for Swedes. We are expecting the refugees to be greatful and the standard of living is still higher than we had as military conscripts, but we did not have to share room with traumatised people whos language we did not understand, we had a limited time to live in tents in the cold Swedish winter and so on. .....Now the swedish government are doing adjustments in our refugeepolicies. We are now becoming die hard strict instead of super generous¬† "
627,"Take off as a verb has a number of different uses. It may also be a hyphenated noun, Take-off.Remove or Divest; as in, for example, ""Take off (an item of clothing or adornment)"". In this case the opposite would be Put on, as in ""I put on (an item of clothing etc.)""Take to the air; as in, for example, ""The (rocket/plane/balloon/bird) took off"". In this case, the opposite would be Land, as in, ""I saw the (rocket/plane/balloon/bird) land"".

628,"The Hell I was forced to live in for nearly two years.This is a long story, but I feel it has secrets that I must tell.For the first half of my teenaged years, my life was privileged and I was ignorantly blissful. From the ages 13‚Äì16, all was well and lovely.I was beautiful. Enviable smooth skin, long blonde hair, hazel eyes. I was tall and tanned and slender and my parents were wealthy and I had everything I thought I could want.I went on dates when I turned 15 every Friday night. I'd go bowling with my friends. We'd go ice skating and shopping and we'd laugh in the streets and everyone would look at us. We wore pretty clothes and had perfect makeup, and we all were identical in our looks. I thought this was what I had to offer. Beauty. The ability to make others jealous.This all changed when I turned 16.My step-father was having an affair. He left myself, my brother, and my uneducated, ignorant mother quickly and effortlessly. He never looked back.My mother was forced to move us two hours away from our private school. My step-father stopped paying for it, so my brother and I had to go to a public school. My friends stopped talking to me.We lived in a low budget area. My mother found work as a maid, but it wasn't enough.One day, I came home from school, and 80% of my clothing was gone. My old makeup was missing too.I asked my mother where it was. She told me she sold it to one of her clients, and she left her makeup bag at a bus stop, so she took mine.My mother only cared about how she looked. As did I. She taught me to. She didn't care about anything else, other than her looks.My face began to break out horribly. I got acne everywhere.I went to school in cheap shorts and t-shirts everyday, with a shitty book bag. Boys didn't look at me anymore. I was horrified. Everything changed. It felt like I was living in a different world. My hair got dry and brittle, from all the days I straightened and curled it. I had no products to fix it.I got scarily skinny. My curves were gone.Who was I without my beauty, I wondered. I didn't know.Now, I'm sure I know what you're thinking: the vapid rich girl who turned into the ugly poor one got what she deserved. And you're right. I was proud and arrogant and spoiled. I did get what I deserved.But this is only the beginning of the story. I told you it was a long one.By the time I was 17, I accepted my pimples, and my crap hair, and the loss of my beauty. I learned that I actually had a personality.As I began to gain back a slight bit of confidence, my mother lost all of hers.She stopped working. She said it made her look bad to work as a maid for rich people, in houses that used to look like our own.We got evicted, and became homeless.My biological father lived in Scotland. He couldn't help us, and at the time, I doubted that he'd want to.My brother got a job as a dishwasher in a restaurant. He's the one that truly suffered it all. He was a good person. Popular at our old school for all the right reasons. He was kind and intelligent, talented. Handsome. While my mother and I were both terrible people, he was an amazing one.He barely made anything working. We slept under freeway underpasses. A far cry from where we used to live.Men bothered me constantly.Some wanted sex, others yelled at me, calling me pizza face and telling me to buy a mask.I was assaulted on a number of occasions.I cried everyday. I felt so sorry for myself. So embarrassed. I had Polaroids of my old boyfriends and I, of my old ""friends"" and I. I was stunning, and still, that's all I could think about - my loss of beauty.I forgot about my personality for a while.We still went to school. Everyone knew we were homeless. It was a moderately small town.The owner of the restaurant my brother worked at allowed us to stay in his backhouse that was infested with roaches, among other things.There was only cold water, and no electricity..."

631,"I guess to answer the question we'd need some more information.¬† What would you want 5-2 to be?If you say 2+2 = 5 and 5-2 = 2, then all you've done is reassigned the symbol 5 to the number which is 2+2.¬† You'd need another symbol for the number which succeeds 2+2, perhaps X.¬† Then arithmetic would be unchanged except you've replaced all 4's with 5's and all 5's with X's.If you say 2+2=5 and 5-2 =3, then we are in trouble.¬† Because then on one hand, (2+2)-2 = 5-2 =3, and on the other hand 2+(2-2) = 2+0 = 2.¬† So 3=2.¬† Subtracting 2 from both sides, 1=0.¬† And if 1=0, then 1+1=0+0, so 2=0.¬† If 2=0, then 2+1=0+0, so 3=0.¬† Continuing in this fashion, we can show all integers are equal to 0.¬† Thus all of arithmetic would collapse into a single number: zero.The only way out would be to allow (2+2)-2 and 2+(2-2) to be different numbers.¬† That means the addition operation would break the associative law.¬† Without the associative law it is very hard to do any arithmetic at all since you cannot combine more than two numbers reliably."
632,"If you want to know about any impact on your credit score (CIBIL score) by paying only Minimum Due Amount then first you need to understand what is the term minimum amount due.Minimum Amount Due is the amount of money that you are required to pay on your credit card statement each month before due date for :No late payment chargesYour account not to be reported as irregular to the credit bureausOn the other hand, let‚Äôs understand what happens when you pay only Minimum Amount Due:You need to pay interest on outstanding amount.There will be no grace period on new purchases .Which means you have to pay interest on all of them for next period and do remember interest rates on credit cards are INSANELY High.Now paying minimum balance for even one month leads to the situation when you will not get a grace period until you pay the outstanding balance in full for two billing cycles in a row.This situation is ideal for Credit Card Companies and their business runs because of customers who pay minimum balance without realizing that it leads to debt trap.The only thing you are getting by paying the minimum balance is that the Credit Card company is not reporting your account to credit bureaus (e.g. CIBIL) as irregular but wait that doesn‚Äôt mean it can‚Äôt impact your credit score.Minimum Amount Due is not directly used (or as publicized) in credit score calculations.But that does not mean that this state will be maintained in future.Credit Card Companies do send all the information about how you are using the credit card to credit bureaus, it‚Äôs just that this factor is currently not used directly in the model of computing the score.But it can affect the score indirectly because of another factor on which the Credit Score directly depends and that is the Credit Utilization Ratio .It is the Amount Owed divided by the Total Available Credit Limit given by the creditor and the lower it is the better.You should strive to keep the Credit Utilization Ratio as low as possible (if possible less than 30%)Now when you pay only Minimum Amount Due then Credit Utilization Ratio increases and will have adverse effect on the score.This situation is more prominent when available credit limit is low.So paying Minimum Amount Due is never a good idea for your overall financial well being.In case of any doubts just follow the cardinal rule of credit card use :PAY BALANCE IN FULL(Image from Stock Market Gamification App )I hope it helps."

634,"Today, the Indian community in Malaysia, once largely a community of plantation workers, has become diversified with a sprinkling of entrepreneurs, intellectuals and technical professionals. Though the vast majority of Indians in Malaysia still lag behind Malays and Chinese in socio-economic terms, the new immigrants are slowly affecting change. The new Indian immigrants, (mostly technology professionals, and the strides made by the tiny Malaysian Indian middle class have given Indians in Malaysia a facelift.But perceptions toward Indians have not changed dramatically. Malaysia's survey of race relations, released in March last year, paints an unflattering, stereotypical image of Indians in Malaysia. Mantras like ""the Malays are lazy, the Chinese are greedy and the Indians are cheats"" are still a part of Malaysian lore.The reasons for the socio-economic backwardness of Indians in Malaysia can be traced to their immigration history.The second wave of Indians came as auxiliaries, mostly from North India, as part of the police force and security services. About the same time also came Indians from Kerala and Sri Lankan Tamils from Jaffna to work as clerks and subordinate civil servants. The third stream of immigrants came as traders, most predominant among these were the Chettiars, a South Indian moneylending caste.The latest wave of Indian immigration started toward the end of the last century when Malaysia, like its neighbor Singapore, began looking at India as a source for knowledge economy professionals. Starting in the 1970s, Malaysia began a transition to an industrialised economy, aided by its petroleum boom. In later decades, as the world economy globalized, Malaysia sought to become a services hub and develop a knowledge-based economy. Indians in the IT sector were especially sought after. Malaysia even formally signed a Memorandum of Understanding with India on manpower recruitment on a contract basis in March 2005.The other segment of Indian diaspora is not as confident, nor as successful. Some of the poorest laborers in Malaysia are Indians, living a hand to mouth existence. In 2000, TimeAsia reported that Indians have the lowest share of the nation's corporate wealth: 1.5%, compared to 19.4% for the Malays and 38.5% for the Chinese. The highest rate of suicide of any community is among Indians. Gangsterism and violent crime is largely associated with Indians. In 1994, 128 of the 377 murders committed in Malaysia were by Indians. Some 15% of the Indians in the capital are squatters.P.S: The above article has been taken from a Malaysian portal.However I would like to add personally that Malaysia is a semi-dictatorial state. The native Malay Muslims enjoy most benefits. I am not sure why the Indians do not do as well as the Chinese."

637,"My opinion:Let the anthem be played in movie halls on special days, like the Republic Day or Independence day. Playing it every single day before every show in every theatre in the country is, over doing it, in my opinion.Of course, I will stand up whenever and wherever the anthem is played if this decision is enforced.But I am afraid, when it is forced down on millions of people, like this, it detracts from the speciality of the anthem. A movie hall experience is not a formal Government inauguration ceremony, or convocation or similar formal functions. Let the national anthem be special and be put on a pedestal and not made to rub shoulders with advertising jingles we hear over Radio and TV.I hope they don‚Äôt start this before every single ODI or Test match, or before every single top rated TV Serial or every time Arnab Goswami opens his Talk show program which may perhaps be named ‚ÄúThe Nation wants to know‚ÄùI am also apprehensive of some zealous state patriots demanding that the State‚Äôs Anthem should also be played along with the National anthem. Whatever the logic in favour of playing the national anthem in every theatre in every show, will perhaps be valid for the State Anthem too.I would be curious to know if any country in the world has adopted this practice, or will we be unique in this respect.GV(Patriotic Indian)"
638,"This answer deals with a hypothetical world where a single woman would be elected president.So lets look at history for possible reference points. James Buchanan was an elected bachelor so he didn't have a wife to play the role of First Lady. In his case his niece Harriet Lane took over the responsibilities of the First Lady and is recognized as the First Lady during his tenure as president.If we take into account widowers who were elected presidents such as Thomas Jefferson, Andrew Jackson, Martin Van Buren and Chester A. Arthur, their deceased wives are considered their First Ladies. Even though someone else might have done job of First Lady the deceased partner is still given the title.In our situation if the elected President was not a widow, chances are whomever they appointed to take the role would be given the title. If they appointed a man history might refer to the person as the First Gentleman or if they appointed a woman the White House would have another First Lady.In a situation where the President was a widow, the now deceased partner would be considered the First Gentleman though someone else might take up the job responsibilities instead. In the situation where the elected President had a female spouse the deceased spouse would be referred to as the First Lady.Source: List of First Ladies of the United States"

641,"Vampires are supposed to be scary. They are meant to be undead creatures of the night with big fangs that drink blood by biting the neck and have the ability to morph into bats.I don't mind them being able to handle sunlight as long as the reason why makes sense. In the novels ‚ÄúAbraham Lincoln Vampire Hunter‚Äù and ‚ÄúThe Last American Vampire‚Äù it is explained that after the first 100 years of being a vampire, their skin adapts and they can handle sunlight.That makes a hell of a lot more sense to me than Twilight's explanation that sunlight makes them sparkle. Seriously that's just dumb. Also Vampires saying that their vegetarian because they only drink animal blood is just dumb as well. Also based on my one viewing of the first movie and reviews I've watched of the others, I'm pretty sure that they never once are shown turning into bats. Vampires are meant to be scary, not romantic.Oh and Kristen Stewart plays Bella but she can't act to save her life. She always has the same expression on her face. This is a terrible love story and it's the one most people blame for starting the trope of love triangles in books and movies. Joker and Harley's abusive one-sided romance makes more sense than this.Also the last movie has a big battle which turns out to just be a vision that one of the psysic good guys shows villain would happen if they fought. Yeah that battle, it never happened. That's a terrible way to end the series.You'll notice that I haven't mentioned the werewolves yet. Why's that? Because they're fine for the most part. They turn into wolves and they actually look right. I'd still prefer if they were scary or if the transformation was shown to be very painful and terrifying like in most movies, but I'm ok without that. However don't think that means I'm giving Jacob a pass.So Bella chose to marry and have a kid with vampire Edward over him. That's fine. But you know what isn't fine, when Jacob becomes a pedophile by imprinting on Bella's daugther, Nessie (‚ÄúYou nicknamed my daughter after the loch Ness monster?!!‚Äù I will never be able to take that stupid line seriously.) Jacob imprinted on a newborn baby happened to be the daughter of his ex and decided to protect and be with her. He will fall in love with her when she gets old enough. I don't care that Nessie is a vampire human hybrid that ages faster, it's still messed up pedophilia.This movie and book series is terrible, it's the worst movie and book series to ever exist. When I first heard anything about it, I was told that it's about Vampires vs Werewolves. Thats not even remotely true. Its a terrible love story and the wereworlve don't show up until the second movie. Girls liking it because they have a crush on Jacob or Edward, that's an okay excuse. But straight guys like myself, have no reason to enjoy this piece of shit. If there was a barrel full of bad movies, this would be at the bottom because it's the absolute worst. If I could do this, I'd gather every copy of the Twilight movies and books, and I'd burn them all. If I had to choose between being brutally murdered and watching or reading the whole Twilight Saga, I'd pick brutally murdered. That's how much I hate Twilight.Edit: Thanks for the upvotes. This is by far my most upvoted answer."
642,"US Perspective:‚ÄúNGO‚Äù in the US usually refers to non-stock corporations or not-for-profit corporations that have obtained 501(c)(3) status. The minimum cost of starting an NGO depends on (1) the cost of forming the corporation, (2) the cost of requesting recognition as an organization exempt from taxation under section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code, and (3) the cost of registering as a charity in the states where you may be conducting fundraising activities.Here is an example breakdown:In New York, the filing fee for forming a not-for-profit corporation is $75. You will also want to get a certified copy of your Certificate of Incorporation, which costs $10. ($85 total)The application for recognition for exemption from taxation under section 501(c)(3) is IRS Form 1023. There are two versions, an expedited Form 1023-EZ which requires your organization to meet certain criteria, and a more general Form 1023. The cost for filing Form 1023-EZ online is $275. The cost for filing regular Form 1023 is $400 if the organization has not or does not anticipate to have gross revenue over $40,000 over a 4 year period, or $850 if it does. Most organizations that file regular Form 1023 pay $850.Nonprofits that solicit contributions n NY or from NY persons or entities, and nonprofits formed under NY law or conducts activity in NY, must register with the NY charities bureau using Form 410.

643,"There is no best programming language. There are fitting languages for a problem.C is a very efficient language, that is compiling to almost no overhead on most modern compilers (almost leaves still a lot to optimize, trust me with that), Lua on the other hand is one of the smallest embeddable HLL, that gives a lot for the 3 kb of code that it will ‚Äúblow up‚Äù your application and the 120 kb of library code that will ‚Äúhog your computer‚Äù.Luajit is indeed one of the fastest HLL you can ever get, only modern Javascript can come up to it‚Äôs speed, but how near (or better) it comes, it will eat away a lot more of your system for that. A LOT.So, you usually have the three levels of application programming:Application programming (HLL, script languages)Implementation programming (algorithms, implementation, libraries, systemOptimization (hardware layer, ASM, GPU, serving specialized chipsets)While level 2 is usually done by a compiling language, that is trading speed for flexibility and compiles into a more or less static application, level 1 is scriptable, flexible and gives you on the user-level a lot of leeway for configuration and changing the dataflow.Script level languages are usually much slower, can hog your application with a garbage collection that you may or may not control at all, but it gives you a lot of power for a near-English level programming interface, that even your average user can deal with.Typical example is the LibreOffice spreadsheet. 1) is the programming of the sheet and the cells 2) is the implementation of the program 3) is using the GPU if OpenCL is available for calculating the cells. Perfect example and you can easily see why the heck you need level one in almost every project.And why also configuration files are much better if you do them in a HLL like Lua. Bad thing about HLL is usually that they hog your system, so on an embedded computer you need something fast, that isn‚Äôt eating what little you have away. That‚Äôs not worth it. So the price of that level one is very important.Lua is as powerful as Python and even easier to write, but comes at costs that are like factor 20 to factor 50 lower, depending of what you are doing. Python doesn‚Äôt have that easy interface to go down from HLL to C, the easy C API of Lua is almost unique among the languages we have.You do not decide between those two programming languages, you are using them as a team, they are a very powerful combination.Think about what PHP did the the static HTML in 1995: it created the modern Web 2.0 and with that changed the world. This means to insert something intelligent, something dynamic into a static structure and enable to access the content in a flexible and intelligent way.You insert Lua into your C application and you will create the revolution of App 2.0.We are on the threshold of that revolution. You don‚Äôt decide which one to use, you take the package and burn down the house with it. It‚Äôs time for it, our software is crap and inflexible. It needed a long time for this.Luajit is available for all platforms and I would lay that to your heart, because it‚Äôs the most powerful implementation of Lua, while Lua 5.3 is just the most modern one, but it lacks a lot of the power and comes with a much higher price to pay.It needs a little bit more of code space for the Luajit library, but the 150 kb for usual Lua and 400 kb for Luajit is pretty damn well worth it. Lua is twenty times faster than PHP or Python, by the way and eats only a tiny fraction of the memory. And it yields all the power.So, I guess it‚Äôs a good choice for going embedded. Yielding a lot of power is something that you might want on those systems.Read more about Luajit on the page: The LuaJIT ProjectIt‚Äôs a pretty good deal you get with that, as I say there‚Äôs nothing that Lua 5.3 can do that you can‚Äôt do in 5.1 and there is a lot a whole lot Luajit can do, that you can‚Äôt do with the vanilla versions.Like FFI to start with (direct access to all system libraries with no need for glue-code!), like Bitfields, like JIT control, GC control and all that. Also, many projects like Love2D and others that are indeed going into this are implementing with JIT. For a little trade of 250 kb of code you get like 10 times the speed, means you get down to just factor 2 behind pure C usually, while that can become worse if you do it wrong, of course.But you usually don‚Äôt implement time consuming things in Lua itself, you implement that in C and just call it. Like we did back on our 8-bit machines with BASIC. If you look at Tiobe, Lua is on place 30 or so, but you should give a damn on that. Because that index totally fails on something like Lua. Because it is counted as just a ‚Äúfeature‚Äù of your application, not the applications language. Which is wrong.So Lua will never climb above 20 on that index. Even if everything is done with it. But you are jumping in and out of Lua all the time, enter C, work there, jump back to Lua. You can call Lua from C and you can write Lua libraries in C and call with that C from Lua, you can call everything from everything, like directly call functions in Lua from C or the other way around. This is really unique.So, don‚Äôt decide between those two languages, like you would not decide what you need for your car: the motor or the wheels.This team is very very powerful and we will get to the App 2.0 revolution with it. Many good programs are switching at the moment or better Lua-enhancing their functionality. It also means you can directly communicate with everything over the Lua interface on the net, on your computer or on any layer the future might bring and of which you didn‚Äôt think when you designed your program and compiled it.Check Neovim, LuaLaTeX/LuaTeX, Nmap, Snort and many more.List of applications using Lua - Wikipedia also check the free Love2D game engine and all the games done with Lua. That language can serve the real time demand that a game will load on it‚Äôs shoulder, so don‚Äôt worry. It can multithread and has real coroutines, does more or less everything Python can but Python can‚Äôt do some of the things Lua can. And it does it slowly and sluggish. Don‚Äôt know why they hyped Python so much.Lua is also cheap to learn. If you need more than two days to grasp the principles, you are doing something wrong. There are just 21 basic commands, that‚Äôs even less than C. But it is expandable and you can program and make out of it, what you like, up to an object orientated mess, if you like this kind of stuff.I mean, sometimes it‚Äôs just what you‚Äôll need, so good to have it. Or real functional programming: you got it.So. Don‚Äôt decide between those two languages. Bind them together like dynamite and the ignitor and go move some stuff.

644,"Practice. Practice Practice. Never pass up a chance to practice. So, what if you mix things up? Today is just practice. Tomorrow is another day.I am an American who has worked in two dozen countries and spent 10 years in China as well as many years in Germany and several years in Thailand. So, I have much practice with non-native speakers, such as you.1st, you are probably not too bad at English.2nd, You probably put too much pressure on yourself. 3rd, Don‚Äôt worry about your mistakes. They are building blocks.4th, Choose an American or Brit or Aussie or Kiwi who you admire, and say to yourself, ‚ÄúSomeday, I want to talk one-on-one with that person in good English.‚ÄùMaybe, that person is Barack Obama. Or maybe, it is Queen Elizabeth. It doesn‚Äôt matter. Your choice. In the meantime, everyone else you speak to in English is practice until you meet that special person. From now on, every English speaker you meet is just practice, until you sit down and talk to that one important person. Before that, it is just practice. It doesn‚Äôt matter that you fail, each and every day. It‚Äôs just practice. So, enjoy your practice and your failure. It‚Äôs practice.5th. Again. You are putting too much pressure on your self. Relax. You are probably comparing yourself to native English speakers. Yes, it will be a while before you reach that level. Don‚Äôt worry. You are only practicing.Do you think, Babe Ruth, the American baseball hero of the 1920‚Äôs and 1930‚Äôs, hit a home run, every time he came to the bat in baseball? No. He practiced.Do you think Michael Jordan, the Chicago Bulls basketball hero, scored a three pointer, every time he shot a basketball? The answer is, ‚ÄúNo.‚ÄùThe secret :Every time you try to speak English, you are practicing. You practice. You make a mistake. So what??? You go home and learn from what didn‚Äôt go as well as you hoped. Then figure out how to make it better.I am lucky to live in Hawaii. Years ago, I wanted to learn Japanese. Everyday, I would go to Waikiki Beach and ask a Japanese tourist questions such as, ‚ÄúWhat did you do yesterday? Tell me about your job? What do you plan to do in Hawaii?‚Äù I would go home and learn learn from my mistakes. The next day, I would go back to the beach and have a new teacher. Step by step, my Japanese becomes better. You should do the same thing.You will not hit a Home Run the first time at bat. But, after 20 times, you will start to hit home runs with some consistency. (Watch the movie Groundhog Day starring Bill Murray). Practice makes you better.My wife was probably much like you. She is a Hakka, a minority person from China. She grew up in a small, minority mountain village in China. She set a goal of learning English, (probably because, as a minority, she would not meet her goals in China). From then on, she never passed up an opportunity to try and learn English. That was how we met. I am very, very proud of my wife. My wife got up early each morning to watch the English television news from Hong Kong. She worked as a waitress in an International bar in China to improve her English. She didn‚Äôt miss a chance to assist a westerner shopping in a local market. On Sundays, she awoke early to take a two hour bus ride into the city to go to an English Corner session where she could talk with westerners.Now, she is in Hawaii. She graduated at the top of her University of Hawaii undergraduate and graduate classes. Now, as a manager, she continues to work diligently and is on her way to becoming an executive in a 5 star hotel in Hawaii.Her comment, ‚ÄúIt is easy to succeed in America. All you have to do is work harder than everyone else.‚Äù But you do have to work hard, and use every opportunity to practice your skills.I encourage you to keep trying and don‚Äôt worry about your mistakes. It is all about practice. Remember, what you are doing now is practice for the future. Don‚Äôt worry, if you make a few mistakes today. Tomorrow is another day.Also, I suggest, you write my wife‚Äôs above comment on your mirror and read it to yourself every morning. With practice you will become an excellent English speaker."
645,"Sexuality is not a single spectrum but a series of spectra that might to borrow from Peter Flom who uses the metaphor in relation to autism and related conditions, be compared to a ballpark in 3 dimensions. You can have any number of positions in the infield and outfield.Homosexuatiy refers to 3 differing things, whom you are romantically attracted to, whom you are sexually attracted to, and how you identify your own person internally.You can exist anywhere along these three axes. From purely heterosexual to purely homosexual, from asexual to sex addicted or nymphomania, and from static in your identity to completely fluid.Consequently you appear to be attracted to men, to identify as homosexual and to either tends toward asexuality, or else disinterest or dislike of specific sex acts."

652,"Scientific Reason :There are thousands of temples all over India in different size, shape and locations but not all of them are considered to be built the Vedic way. Generally, a temple should be located at a place where earth's magnetic wave path passes through densely. It can be in the outskirts of a town/village or city, or in middle of the dwelling place, or on a hilltop. The essence of visiting a temple is discussed here.Now, these temples are located strategically at a place where the positive energy is abundantly available from the magnetic and electric wave distributions of north/south pole thrust. The main idol is placed in the core center of the temple, known as ""*Garbhagriha*"" or *Moolasthanam*. In fact, the temple structure is built after the idol has been placed. This *Moolasthanam* is where earth‚Äôs magnetic waves are found to be maximum. We know that there are some copper plates, inscribed with Vedic scripts, buried beneath the Main Idol. What are they really? No, they are not God‚Äôs / priests‚Äô flash cards when they forget the *shlokas*. The copper plate absorbs earth‚Äôs magnetic waves and radiates it to the surroundings. Thus a person regularly visiting a temple and walking clockwise around the Main Idol receives the beamed magnetic waves and his body absorbs it. This is a very slow process and a regular visit will let him absorb more of this positive energy. Scientifically, it is the positive energy that we all require to have a healthy life.Further, the Sanctum is closed on three sides. This increases the effect of all energies. The lamp that is lit radiates heat energy and also provides light inside the sanctum to the priests or *poojaris* performing the pooja. The ringing of the bells and the chanting of prayers takes a worshipper into trance, thus not letting his mind waver. When done in groups, this helps people forget personal problems for a while and relieve their stress. The fragrance from the flowers, the burning of camphor give out the chemical energy further aiding in a different good aura. The effect of all these energies is supplemented by the positive energy from the idol, the copper plates and utensils in the *Moolasthan*am / *Garbagraham*. *Theertham*, the ‚Äúholy‚Äù water used during the pooja to wash the idol is notplain water cleaning the dust off an idol. It is a concoction of Cardamom,*Karpura* (Benzoin), zaffron / saffron, *Tulsi* (Holy Basil), Clove, etc...Washing the idol is to charge the water with the magnetic radiations thus increasing its medicinal values. Three spoons of this holy water is distributed to devotees. Again, this water is mainly a source of magneto-therapy. Besides, the clove essence protects one from tooth decay, the saffron & *Tulsi* leafs protects one from common cold and cough, cardamom and *Pachha Karpuram* (benzoin), act as mouth fresheners. It is proved that *Theertham* is a very good blood purifier, as it is highly energized. Hence it is given as *prasadam* to the devotees. This way, one can claim to remain healthy by regularly visiting the Temples. This is why our elders used to suggest us to offer prayers at the temple so that you will be cured of many ailments. They were not always superstitious. Yes, in a few cases they did go overboard when due to ignorance they hoped many serious diseases could be cured at temples by deities. When people go to a temple for the *Deepaaraadhana*, and when the doors open up, the positive energy gushes out onto the persons who are there. The water that is sprinkled onto the assemblages passes on the energy to all. This also explains why men are not allowed to wear shirts at a few temples and women are requested to wear more ornaments during temple visits. It is through these jewels (metal) that positive energy is absorbed by the women. Also, it is a practice to leave newly purchased jewels at an idol‚Äôs feet and then wear them with the idol‚Äôs blessings. This act is now justified after reading this article. This act of ‚Äúseeking divine blessings‚Äù before using any new article, like books or pens or automobiles may have stemmed from this through mere observation.Energy lost in a day‚Äôs work is regained through a temple visit and one is refreshed slightly. The positive energy that is spread out in the entire temple and especially around where the main idol is placed, are simply absorbed by one's body and mind. Did you know, every Vaishnava(Vishnu devotees), ‚Äúmust‚Äù visit a Vishnu temple twice every day in their location. Our practices are NOT some hard and fast rules framed by 1 man and his followers or God‚Äôs words in somebody‚Äôs dreams. All the rituals, all the practices are, in reality, well researched, studied and scientifically backed thesis which form the ways of nature to lead a good healthy life.The scientific and research part of the practices are well camouflaged as ‚Äúelder‚Äôs instructions‚Äù or ‚Äúgranny‚Äôs teaching‚Äôs‚Äù which should be obeyed as a mark of respect so as to once again, avoid stress to the mediocre brains."
653,"Of course.For males, circumcision is the cutting of the foreskin. This is the form practiced by the Prophet Abraham (ASWS). This is obligatory for them.For females, circumcision is also obligatory, and is the cutting of the Clitoris and preferably the Labia, though not all legitimate scholars agree on this. I would personally say that circumcision for women is cutting the Clitoris and the Labia Minora, while keeping the Labia Majora intact.Lately, there has been an attack on Islam, with western enemies fighting against female. and even male circumcision. This is a threat we must fight against.There are many advantages to female circumcision. Without the Clitoris (An organ with no important function), a woman is not only less likely to commit adultery and fornication, but also less likely to demand intimacy when the husband does not desire it. This makes marital life much more bearable. This is because of two main things:1- Without a clitoris, a woman has much less lust and sexual desires. If she does not desire sex, she will not annoy or nag her husband or commit fornication or adultery, thus saving her from a great punishment in both this life and the afterlife.2- Circumcision usually causes intercourse to be painful. As a result of this, a woman would refuse to commit adultery or fornication, and would not inconvenience her husband needlessly because of lust or desires.The movement to ban circumcision, part of the Fitrah, is a western secularist movement that is part of the plan of our enemies to destroy Islam. We must band together and fight this injustice with the assistance of the one true God."

661,"I am a closeted homosexual Indian male. The fact that I have written this answer anonymously itself shows what the current situation for sexual minorities in the country is. For some people, accepting their sexuality is difficult. Luckily for me, the whole process of acceptance was very smooth. Since I was a child, I always knew that I found the male body more attractive than that of a woman. I displayed slightly gender deviant behaviour when I was in school, and as is the norm in our society, I was made fun of. But that didn't bother me much because my parents loved me despite of that (and I hope they still do when I come out to them). I really started to understand about homosexuality when I got into college, but it never once crossed my mind that I could be gay. In my first year college, I was pretty insensitive to other people and passed a lot of homophobic comments, which I regret now. I guess I enjoyed not being the victim this time. In my second year, when I was reading an article about LGBT, it suddenly stuck me that I am the G in LGBT. I found a lot of stuff on the internet that helped me realise that it is nothing abnormal(Internet is the best thing that happened to homosexuals in India!). In my third year I came out to my best friend and my closest cousin. Luckily, they were extremely supportive. Then I discovered Grindr and PR. Through these apps, I met a couple of guys in my college. But these apps are full of lecherous and bigoted people. It is difficult to find good people here. This is my last year in college, and there is a lot of uncertainty about the future, because the situation in our country is not good for homosexuals. I plan on coming out to my family soon, but I am treading on a tight rope here. It is really hard living a two-faced life. I have dreamed of emigrating to another LGBT friendly country, where I will be accepted for who I am.Coming out is a difficult process, especially in India. There are many conservative and religious outfits who wield considerable power and are strictly against homosexuality.Another problem with the county is that there are millions of people who don't know the homosexuality exists. Of those who are aware of the fact of it's existence, a large number looks at it as an abomination. There are very few people who actually understand that being hetero-/homo-/bisexual is nothing but just one aspect of your personality, just like being tall or short or having brown eyes. It doesn't completely define a person. Homosexuality is still perceived by many as a western phenomenon which is ""corrupting"" Indian society.A common misconception is that homosexuals are a group of similar minded people and they tend to associate common characteristics to all of them. For example, not all gay men exhibit gender deviant behaviour, and not all men who exhibit gender deviant behaviour are gay/transgender. And also, it is important to understand that there is nothing wrong with not conforming with what society thinks how you should behave. There is also a need to dissociate homosexuals/bisexuals from transgenders and the ""Hijras"". In India, neither of these communities are treated with respect. They are seen as less than human, which is appalling for a country that boasts of its diversity and ""tolerance"".¬† If a man comes out as gay, he is called hijara or 'chakka' which is really bad for his self-esteem. This and other forms of discrimination, often lead to depression and suicides. People need to know the difference between the two, and need to respect people for who they are. To sum up, being homosexual(or any of LGBTIA) in India is a difficult struggle. But there is some hope, as some NGOs are constantly fighting for our cause. And we hope to see a change soon."

663,"Let me inject my little humble experience with the Nationalist military‚Äîno exactly answering your question, but may provide some insight to the Nationalist government‚Äôs downfall.The Nationalist government withdrew to Taiwan in 1949, telling its own people that it was a temporary tactical maneuver and that we would soon counter-attack and retake the homeland. I was brought up in such belief. In all honesty, that was the only belief around‚Äîor rather, allowed.In 1967, 18 years after the KMT-CCP civil war, like all my contemporaries at the time, I began my military service as a platoon leader in the Marine Corps right after college (sort of ROTC-like officer in the US). When I first reported to my company with much apprehension, I felt no welcome‚Äîor rather, I was made to feel like an outsider. Without saying a word, a master sergeant handed me my uniform and placed my civilian clothing in a bag. I noticed he never bothered to solute, as I was made extremely conscious that respecting rank was an utmost important way to keep the military discipline, regardless personal feelings toward the person who happens to out-rank you. I sort tried to understand how a fifty-some-year-old master sergeant would feel when he had to salute to a young kid thirty years his junior, but, again, I did not invent the rules.I was shown to my tiny officer quarter. The place was already occupied by another officer and he grudgingly cleared out the upper bunk bed for me to crawl in. I considered myself lucky: comparing it to the open double-deck sleeping arrangement during my boot-camp days, it is a private mansion.On the same evening, I saw my platoon the first time. An unhappy‚Äîvery very unhappy indeed‚Äî old sergeant named Li who had acted as the substitute platoon leader rudely summoned the thirty-some skeptically looking young conscripts and reluctantly transferred his command to me. I knew even then from the looks of the young troopers that the old fellow Li would not give up his power without a fight. I kept my posture and introduced myself briefly to the troopers and told the sergeant to dismiss the squad and let the guys rest early. Soon after I turned my back I heard the old sergeant begin barking at the conscripts and kept rambling, shouting out a long tirade about discipline, honor, and duties, which I considered completely irrelevant. I was torn between stopping him from the nonsense volley for the sake of the troopers and keeping the protocol which gave him the prerogatives as a sergeant to bark on. I backed off from the direct confrontation with Li, not a pleasant first day in the service.No sooner did I report to duty than the company was given the order to march out with full gear, with the M2 for foot soldiers, a carbine for sergeants and the .45 caliber pistol for officers. I never shot a 45 pistol but it felt good, I had to admit. We were not told where to go, or what to do or what to expect. I overheard the soldiers mumbling that since no live ammunition was dispensed so that must be good, meaning at best just an exercise of some sort, unlike two years before when live ammunition was dispensed and with all communications with outside cut off did they all break out in tears, realizing something bad was going to happen. Fortunately, I was later told, the mission was scuttled as the first ships entering Xiamen Harbor was intercepted and the entire crew was captured.We marched for hours to get on a gigantic transport ship in ZhoYin. That was quite a sight to behold: hundred and hundred of us jammed on every single square inch on deck, and the loud growling landing ships (LTV) belched heavy diesel fumes rammed into the lower deck. Soon we set sail. It was a calm but queer night; overhead, the Milky Way easily fit into your hands as the transporter was kept intentionally in the pitch darkness.

If I were to write another book, I'd probably write from the other side: how different companies interview, the pro/cons of different interview process, etc. A lot of the consulting work I've done recently has focused on that side, and I think there would be a lot of value in a book like that."

668,"Great little film. Love to see creativity like this. I have few pointers to help you out.You need to have different shots. This is a must to break up the monotony of the film. The same shot, one after the other is hard to watch without wanting to fast forward. Most shots should be short as this is a short, but this also holds true for most filmmaking. Pick your favororite show or movie, the shots rarely go over 6 seconds, in fact more often they are much shorter (2 to 4 seconds),unless establishing some sort of dramatic tension, establishing a location or setting up blocking for multiple characters or events.Lets use your film as an example. The final repair scene for the ColorShift takes roughly 40 seconds without a single camera angle change. You could break this up with a mid shot of you putting the laptop away and opening the unit, cut to, Closeup of your hands working, cut to, your face in some sort of determined look, and back to the closeup of the repair. After the repair is complete you could go back to a mid shot of you in black and white, hit the button and voila, color again with a satisfied look on you face. End it there, no need to return the package, jut walk off screen and flicker the color.Establish the location of the building with a wide angle establishing shot, (it doesn‚Äôt even have to be your actual building, no one will ever know). Show us where the action is going to take place. Establish the room you are sitting in. Staggering the type of shots from wide or mid to closeups will draw more attention when the closeups are used and will make them more powerful and much more effective.Instead of the same static shot changing color take stills or 2 second long shots of the actual world outside your door and color shift the color on those images, it adds a more personal feel and creates more value for your film. The static long shot changing for ten seconds seems mechanical and impersonal.That all having been said, I hope you understand this was meant to be constructive. I really enjoyed your film. Great work, great concept, great story. Keep making films, you really have something there. Hope this helps.Take care,Jim"
669,"RECENT HISTORY OF KASHMIRThe problem was ‚Äòcreated‚Äô! In 1947 when Pakistan was carved out of India on the basis of ‚ÄòTwo Nation Theory‚Äô, the Muslim majority areas were to go to Pakistan eg. East Bengal and West Punjab, and the other areas of present day Pakistan, and Hindu majority areas were to be part of India. However, there was a problem. There were over 500 princely states which had the right to remain independent. It was left to the rulers to decide if they wanted to merge with India or Pakistan or become a free state. There were some rulers who wanted to merge with Pakistan like the states of Hyderabad and Junagadh which had Hindu majority but the rulers were Muslims, while there were states like Kalat (present day Baluchistan) which wanted to be part of India, but they were coerced or forced to join the Unions.Jammu & Kashmir was also such a state. It can be divided into three parts. The areas in and around Jammu, the majority was Hindu, in Ladakh, the majority are still Buddhists while the valley of Kashmir has Muslim majority. For Maharaja Hari Singh it was a dilemma whether he should be joining India or Pakistan. So, for the time being he decided to remain independent, on the basis of ‚ÄòStandstill Agreement‚Äô which was drafted by the British Government of India in June 1947, which prevented any hostile military intervention by the soon to be created dominions of India and Pakistan. This agreement was signed by all the rulers (princely states) and the signatories of Indian and Pakistani Dominions.Though Maharaja Hari Singh was averse to signing the accession treaty with India, the Pakistan establishment of the time planned an armed take-over of Kashmir. In September 1947, a large army (consisting of mainly Kabailies - tribals, along with army men dressed in civilian clothes invaded Kashmir. There were mass killings of mainly minorities - read Hindus and Sikhs, over 6000 rapes according to UN records, loot and plunder of the region. The Maharaja of Kashmir sought help from India but the Nehru Government refused to intervene initially. Lord Louis Mountbatten, the First Governor General of India advised Maharaja Hari Singh to sign the accession treaty to India. The Maharaja escaped from srinagar,t he Capitol and flew to Jammu, where on October 28th, 1947, he signed the treaty of accession to India. As the accession treaty was being flown to Delhi, Indian army was being flown in to protect Srinagar mainly. Ethically, morally and legally, India was now defending its own territory. Brigadier Usman led the Sikh Regiment in a counter-offensive and drove the infiltrators out of the area and were chasing them out of J&K when an order arrived from the Centre that the assault should stop. Pandit Nehru in his honesty or naivity wanted this issue to be sorted out by the United Nations. He made a blunder by giving a radio speech on All India Radio where he declared that there would be a ‚ÄòPlebiscite‚Äô held in Kashmir to determine which way the Kashmiris want to go.The UNSC passed a resolution # 47 on Kashmir on April 21, 1948. It had three parts -In brief‚Ä¶1) Pakistan would withdraw all its civilian and army men including the tribesmen from the entire region of J&K, including the occupied areas of Pakistan Occupied Kashmir (POK). Following this,2) India would withdraw all its forces except a token army presence in Srinagar to defend the city.When this is done to the satisfaction of the UNSC observers, then‚Ä¶3) A plebiscite was to held in J&K (all areas including POK).Watch this video for a wonderful response on Jammu & Kashmir, by Christine Fair, a South-Asian expert, and Associate Professor, Georgetown University.To this day Pakistan has not carried out its obligation to fulfill the first part of the resolution. UNSC has consistently stated that India and Pakistan must adhere to the said resolution. However, many invading tribesmen settl..."
670,"The federal rules on food stamps for students are somewhat complicated.A ‚Äústudent‚Äù is someone who is between 18 and49 who is attending an institution of higher education and is taking at least 6 units, or is at least half time according to the school. The person has to be in a program of higher education; students who are taking, for instance, English as a second Language (ESL) classes or GED classes are not considered students of higher education.In general, a student does not qualify for food stamps, even if that student is extremely poor. This goes back to the Reagan administration. If you recall that time, you may recall the ‚Äúwelfare queen‚Äù, a black woman who drove a Cadillac and used food stmps to buy thick steaks. That is no more true now than it was then‚Äînothing but a cruel myth. But that‚Äôs how all this was portrayed. I also recall students were castigated because Uncle Sam was allowing them to receive an education and food?! Regular people can‚Äôt do that. Why would liberal lazy students qualify? So in 1981 the Food Stamp Program suffered massive cuts, and most students were cut off.However, some students do qualify. Here are some of the ways:Under or over agephysically or mentally disabledsingle parent of a child under 12 and child care is not availableparent of a child under 6 (if a 2-parent household, only one parent qualifies)working at least 20 hours a week on average earning at least minimum wagereceiving TANF and participating in the work programparticipating in state or federal work studyThe Food Stamp Program, now known as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), has been arguably the single most effective federal program, along with Social Security. The USDA provided a documentary many years ago on the benefits of food stamps. In the film, a doctor is treating a severely malnourished baby, who dies while the camera is filming. In some areas, babies and children no longer die from malnutrition. Elderly now have the ability to get additional food.Yes, there are many problems with the program, but the good far, far outweighs the bad. And this is the program targeted for even more cuts that will affect only affect the poorest of the poor.The federal regulations on student eligibility can be found at 7CFR 273.5."
671,"By recursion, I'm assuming that you're referring to the computer science term[1]. Recursion in computer science is a method where the solution to a problem depends on solutions to smaller instances of the same problem as opposed to iteration[2] which is simply the repetition of a block of statements within a computer program. Many other answers refer to iteration instead of recursion. For instance, looping a video in VLC player can be considered an infinite loop which is simply an iteration that does not terminate.To implement a recursive algorithm, the problem must satisfy the following conditions:It can be broken down into a simpler version of the same problemIt has one or more base cases whose values are knownMy favorite real world example is this one:Let's pretend that you're seated in the last row of a large, packed classroom.Now, for some inexplicable reason, you want to know the number of rows in the room. You're too lazy to count so you ask Mike who is seated in front of you to tell you how many rows are there in front of him. Mike does the same thing and asks Patil who is seated in front of him and so on till Alice who is seated first row is asked the question. Alice can answer Jack seated in the second row because she can see that there are no more rows in front of her. This is the base case. Jack adds 1 to Alice's answer and tells it to Jill who is in the third row and so on until the answer reaches you. Notice that at each step the problem is reduced to a simpler version of the same problem.[1] Recursion (computer science)[2] Iteration"

673,"Well, it depends upon what kind of accordion you are seeking to learn.This?Or this?You see, the answer is not as simple as it seems.The keyboard accordion with chord buttons on the back side of the bellows would be the easier of the two to learn, but still will be a challenge.The button accordion, the second image, will be far more involved, even difficult, to learn to play well.While the first accordion has keys, you still have to train your left hand, the button pushing hand, to function properly - which means that nothing from the piano will work for that hand at all. So it is fresh and new, unfamiliar. But you‚Äôll be playing tunes sooner.The second accordion will be a wholly different instrument to learn to play, all buttons. So very little, if anything physically, will translate from the piano. It will take a bit before you sound like you know what you‚Äôre doing.Then there is the physical activity of working the bellows - all while playing the instrument. The bellows is the soul of the accordion. Work it wrong, and you sound like a bad piper. Work it well, and magic ensues‚Ä¶. after you get everything else reasonably figured out.So, how challenging do you want to make the process?"
674,"Very Disciplined ! I think Indian Army have come a long way. They are among the best armies, undoubtedly. They are well organised, If you want to see discipline at its best in India, have a look at Indian Army.¬† The procedure to do things is quite good, they excel at management.¬† While most of the answers here, will definitely focus on war stories, courage and all of that, what intrigues me the most is day to day life of army personnels. So here comes¬† in the form of little¬† details my view of the Indian Army. I am answering this on basis of what I have seen of Indian Army as a Army Brat.The way Cantonment¬† areas are maintained is the most impressive thing about Army as per me. Cleanliness and greenery are like a part of the Indian Army. No matter which part of city it is, Cantonment areas have their own shine. No matter how filthy¬† a space there is, you give it for settlement to Indian Army, its face will change. Trees will be planted, litter will be cleared, through united efforts.¬† I have seen recruits working hard all day, just to clear the grass. I have nothing but respect and awe for how things happen inside army and how environment and cleanliness occupy an integral part in this sector.You can see hoardings¬† stating messages like ""save trees and wildlife"" and not to create litter or pluck flowers everywhere. The silent, peaceful roads with trees lush green either side, all painted with the¬† familiar¬† saffron¬† at the bottom trunk. This kind of unmatched management is appreciative. Many time, the thought crosses mind, that other institutions should use this approach as a model and work similarly.Its not just the place they live, I think Indian Army have this power to transform a person in something very different. I have grown up seeing people from villages who once knew nothing, struggle in their recruitment period and grow each day, get raises/ promotion and soon one can see¬† visible difference in their personality. Yes ! Be it the officer level entry or regular entries, lives are changed¬† and for good.I think Indian Army offers the best and secure job, which is easily & without corruption in reach of people from distant towns and villages, with marginal study levels. All they need is to qualify one run of their life : And then hardwork and persistence during training¬† :And a lot is changed in some years, they can afford¬† good education and health for their family.  Army personnels are so¬† much concerned about their dresses. Most of the time they expect the same¬†¬† level¬† from their kids too. I remember my Dad would make me and my brother polish our shoes for like half and hour, "" Putting lot of that polish won't help,¬† brushing them will make they shine"" he would instruct ! The way they cover their writing registers. While I was in school, my notebooks were not that well covered. Some had covers on them some did not however my fathers notebooks on the other hand were¬† first well covered with chart papers, then there was, this another layer of neatly done plastic sheet over it.

677,"Unfortunately, no.Blood type is determined based on antigens present on red blood cells. The most widely known blood type system is the ABO blood group system (think blood types A, B, AB, and O).These antigens are expressed through the ABO gene. The ABO locus (a term to describe a gene's position on a chromosome) contains one of three alleles: A, B, or O.Every person inherits one allele from each parent, which gives rise to one of six possible genotypes (AO, AA, BO, BB, AB, and OO) and four possible phenotypes (A, B, AB, and O):*Image source: The ABO blood groupIf both of your parents have blood type B, then they must both express either genotype BO or BB. This would lead you to express genotypes BO, BB, or OO, which means your blood type must be B or O.The (+) after the blood type letter signifies the Rh factor, which denotes whether the D antigen is present (+) or not present (-) on the red blood cells.Based on the possible genotypes for RhD expression, if both of your parents are Rh positive, you can either be Rh positive or Rh negative. Similarly, if one parent is Rh positive and the other Rh negative, you can become either Rh positive or Rh negative. However, if both parents are Rh negative, you will be Rh negative as well.This is due to the RhD gene being dominant, meaning it only needs to be inherited from one parent to be expressed. Therefore, both parents must completely lack RhD expression to be Rh negative, meaning there is no possibility passing it onward.Sources:The ABO blood grouptransfusion.com.auRh blood group system - WikipediaThe Rh blood group"

Physics is all about quantitative analysis whereas Chemistry is only about formulae. Mostly the questions of Chemistry are direct in nature, therefore it is easy to solve. In NEET exam, around 45 questions come from Chemistry, out of which the students have to focus on both class 11 and 12. No one can ignore any chapter across classes. One can omit two or three chapters from where questions do not come usually but that do not mean the students will not focus on those chapters.The ways of preparation‚Ä¢ Practice previous year‚Äôs test papers for a better understanding of the question patterns. From next year onwards, the National Testing Agency (NTA) is going to conduct NEET examination. Therefore, maybe the difficulty level can be increased, but the syllabus will be the same.‚Ä¢ With continuous practice of test papers, the students can understand the question pattern. Even any reputed coaching centre will not give any kind of coming of similar questions.

679,"Here are the things you can do.1.Meditate every day. Twice a day is better. Three times is pretty awesome. Meditate as much as you feel comfortable and then a little bit more.Meditation is important for 2 reasons. One is to begin to free your attention from being identified with thinking. You learn to become a witness to your thoughts, or absorbed in the consciousness/energy/formless being that is transcendent of thoughts or to be absorbed in the silence where there are no thoughts at all.The second reason is to build up the subtle energy known as Shakti in your body, opening and clearing the energy channels of your body so that the Shakti can increase within you, flow easily and begin to rise up through the various chakras of your body.2. Treat your body well. Eat very light and healthy moving towards fresh fruits and vegetables and plant based proteins. Moving away from heavy foods, junk foods, sugar etc. What you put into your body has a huge impact on your awareness and the movement of Shakti in your body. At the same time, eat what is healthy for you. Don‚Äôt make yourself sick going rawfood vegan if you are used to eating hamburgers. Just move towards eating lighter and healthier.Make sure you get exercise every day. Anything that gets your body moving and your breathing heavy. This is very important to help move the energy. A nice walk in nature every day can be very beneficial too.3. Treat your mind well also. Be conscious of what you are putting into it as it will have an effect on your meditation. The movies you watch, the music you listen to, what you see on social media etc.4. Do other spiritual practices. Prana exercises can be very helpful in clearing the energy channels of your body and awakening and moving Shakti. Very important. A simple one is inhale through your nose counting to 4, exhale out your nose counting to 8. So you are exhaling twice as long as the inhale. Do this for 10 minutes or so before meditation every day.Chanting can be helpful. Japa (Silent repetition of a Divine name, Guru or mantra) is very powerful. Don‚Äôt let you mind just be lost in random thoughts. Begin to focus with Japa or self inquiry.5. Get lots of Shakti. Shakti is the energy of enlightenment that is transmitted by enlightened teachers. I offer music that transmits Shakti here if you are interested Deep Meditation Music Proven to Awaken You into BlissI also offer free Online Shakti Transmission Meditations with me if I resonate with you. Sign up to the weekly meditation teaching in the link above and it will notify you of upcoming sessions.That is just what I offer but you can find enlighteneds teacher that you resonate with, that you feel their presence meditating you, awakening you. Look on youtube if you like. Find one where you feel something happening sitting with them. Just because they say nice things does not mean they are enlightened. Find one or two whose presence meditates you, that you feel peaceful or blissful sitting with. This is the Shakti and it is very helpful in awakening you into enlightenment.6. Read books by enlightened teachers or the Upanishads or Dharmmapada etc. Don‚Äôt over read but read a little every day so that your mind becomes focused on enlightenment. Too much will just give you too much knowledge that will get in the way of enlightenment so just a little, digest a little every day. Experience and practice is far more important than understanding. But a little reading can be helpful.7. Start to move your attention into being humble, present, kind, soft. Bow your head figuratively. This humility opens you into awakening. But it is something that will happen naturally as you deepen in awareness. Arrogance is a big obstacle so be aware of that.8. If you do everything above, things inside you will get stirred up, there will be challenges. So surrender to what is. Learn to surrender to what is and allow the energy to heal you, nourish you, dissolve your ego.These are the things you can do. Beyond this, you have to let awakening happen. You do not do awakening. Awakening happens through grace. Doing everything above creates an environment for awakening to take place. But surrender and allow awakening to happen.Hope this helps."

(nods head) Then shouldn‚Äôt it be treated like one. What I mean by that is, here you are signing new customer contracts, an important and memorable event. All while using a very unmemorable pen.We grew up, our entire lives, using cheap BIC pens because they get the job done for grocery lists and directions. But we never gave it much thought to learn what‚Äôs best for more important events.This is the pen for more important events. This is the tool you use to get deals done. Think of it as a symbol for taking your company to the next level. Because when you begin using the right tool, you are in a more productive state of mind, and you begin to sign more new customer contracts.Actually. You know what? Just this week I shipped ten new boxes of these pens to Elon Musk‚Äôs office.Unfortunately, this is my last pen today (reach across to hand pen back to CEO). So, I suggest you get this one. Try it out. If you‚Äôre not happy with it, I will personally come back next week to pick it up. And it won‚Äôt cost you a dime.What do you say?CEO: (picks jaw up off floor) Yes.See how simple that was. The CEO loved it. Why?Because all four sales skills were displayed.Here‚Äôs the simple sales framework I used to answer ‚Äúsell me this pen‚Äù. Memorize it for yourself.Find out how they last used a pen (gather info)Emphasize the importance of the activity they last used a pen (respond to info)Sell something bigger than a pen, like a state of mind (deliver info)Ask for the buy (closing)Does that make sense? Yes. Ok, good.ConclusionRemember, it‚Äôs not about actually selling a pen. It‚Äôs about showing how well you can sell a product.And even though there are an infinite number of answers to this interview question, it‚Äôs easy to memorize a simple formula.Now that you have a formula, next time you need a quick, go-to answer, remember the Senator Club formula.Take 15 minutes today to practice the script above. I promise you will benefit."

684,"The railway reservation system works as follows:Tickets are issued in CNF category until they are exhausted. Further RAC and WL tickets are issued. For RAC and WL tickets your ticket show two RAC or WL numbers. The first is the overall serial number and the other the status at time of booking. If someone cancels a ticket booked ahead of you your RAC or WL tickets move up. If sufficient CNF tickets are submitted for cancellation, the passengers in your ticket get CNF gradually or at one go.Reservation closes some three hours prior to scheduled departure of the train at originating station. Reservation charts are prepared soon after closing of reservation but after allotment of EQ. Seat allotment for RAC and WL tickets initially and later confirmed is made only during chart preparation. So it is immaterial when the individual passenger(s) in a PNR gets confirmation of a seat.The system first finalizes the status of the ticket and allots seats to CNF category. To the possible extent the system allots tickets in same coach and coupe. If not feasible the seats may be issued at various locations. It all depends on the location of cancelled tickets."

686,"It all boils down to understanding.Study habits, the surrounding environment, and all other efforts can be fully maximized if the understanding part is well established.This applies to learning almost anything, and not just limited to academics; it extends to learning a skill, language, topic, or even a game.I had a tuition teacher with a humble-sized group of students who taught Maths and Chemistry. I‚Äôve always scored an ‚ÄúE‚Äù or ‚ÄúF‚Äù for both.‚ÄúI just have no chemistry with Chemistry‚Äù have been my tagline.After just 2 months of tuition, my grades went up significantly. I got a ‚ÄúB‚Äù and ‚ÄúC‚Äù for my preliminary exams for Chemistry and Maths respectively.I remember his words pertaining to how to tackle what I had trouble learning with.‚ÄúAlways look at them in chunks, and break them down in smaller chunks till you get its atomic representation. And then study that till you‚Äôve mastered it with thorough understanding. Piece all the chunks back together. You‚Äôve got yourself a solved Rubik‚Äôs Cube.‚ÄùThat‚Äôs his analogy. And it works every time.Look at every word/terminology that you don‚Äôt understand, and/or you think you understand. Study everything revolving that word/terminology. If you skip a word or two, it could prove to be detrimental and may backfire as it contributes to your lack of understanding. That one word could have been the ultimate ingredient in piecing the last of the big puzzle.For example, if the first sentence in a Chemistry textbook under the topic: Ions wrote, ‚ÄúAn ion is an atom or molecule that has a non-zero net electrical charge (its total number of electrons is not equal to its total number of protons),‚Äù does that effectively explain ions to the student? For instance, in that sentence there are words such as, ‚Äúatom‚Äù, ‚Äúmolecule‚Äù, ‚Äúelectrical charge‚Äù, ‚Äúelectrons‚Äù, ‚Äúprotons.‚Äù Does the student already know those terms beforehand, fully? Or will further research and study of those words be more helpful? Once those terms have been fully understood, that sentence will then make a lot more sense.‚ÄúMere memorization and speed-learning are two of the most effective methods of providing the illusion that you truly understand something, when in actual fact, you have not really. That‚Äôs not how mastering works.‚ÄùThough, as he pointed out, which many agree, is that mastering and truly understanding something comes at a huge cost of time. Though, it is also highly rewarding, especially when you‚Äôre going to create things within your pursuits.‚ÄòUnderstanding is not a stage you‚Äôll clear once done, it is always activated as you dive deeper into your area(s) of study. It only serves as a more smooth and efficient way for you to move forward and progress as you probe deeper and deeper into the layers of your area of study. You never really stop understanding.‚ÄùThe ability to learn (better) = The ability to understand (better)."
687,"Disclaimer: I have not used the Galileo.The Raspberry Pi is a Linux computer on a small board with limited IO to the physical world whereas the Arduino, and the Galileo looks to be an Arduino on steroids, is made primarily for physical computing. The primary limits on uses are that of the user or developers imagination. There are libraries of applications for each. Both types are meant mostly for students, hobbyists, quick prototyping, and the like, but there is nothing stopping someone from using either in a commercial product. Why you don't see this all the time is because of the economics of scale. If you need more that around 25 of something it is cheaper to build the functions into a custom PCB. If someone came to me and wanted me to make five of something and I thought I could do it I would certainly consider using the above boards."
688,"The best movie according to critics is Moonlight. It is then followed by La La Land and Manchester by the Sea for second and third.Topping out the top 6 are Hell or High Water, Arrival, and Toni Erdmann. The remaining top 10 are O.J.: Made in America, The Handmaiden, Jackie, Elle.[update: late September 2017]I completed watching the top 25 in September. So few of these movies received any distribution or notability. I felt that the top two movies by critics (Moonlight and La La Land) were good, but very Hollywood-y and not really to my taste ‚Äî high quality, but not my favorites. My top movies are of 2017 are:Excellent (9/10)#1 Arrival (critics: #4)#2 I Am Not Your Negro (critics #25)#3 Manchester by the Sea (critics #3)Great (8/10)#4 Hell or High Water (critics #4)#5 Hunt For the Wilderpeople (critics #36)#6 Captain Fantastic (critics #40)#7 Moana (critics #48)I‚Äôve really enjoyed watching the top 25 and encourage people to do it if they enjoy cinema.The full list of year‚Äôs movies are:1. Moonlight Effective #1.1 (IMDB)A young man deals with his dysfunctional home life and comes of age in Miami during the ""War on Drugs"" era. The story of his struggle to find himself is told across three defining chapters in his life as he experiences the ecstasy, pain, and beauty of falling in love while grappling with his own sexuality.My opinion: This movie has great supporting roles which were really the highlight of the movie. I found that the three different eras had such different feelings, issues, and vibes that it more felt like three short films rather than one coherent movie. You do get a three dimensional picture of the main character, but I personally didn‚Äôt find him that compelling ‚Äî aloof and distant would be the words I would use to describe him. My rating 6/10.2. La La Land Effective #1.8 (IMDB)A jazz pianist falls for an aspiring actress in Los Angeles.My opinion: Except for the Academy, apparently, I‚Äôm the only person that didn‚Äôt adore this movie. I found it alright. I love the cinematography, particularly the use of color. I don‚Äôt get much out of the dancing and find that it takes away from my enjoyment of films (this is personal preference). I didn‚Äôt particularly like the characters and the story was pretty derivative. So this is expertly made, but not made for me. 5/10.3. Manchester by the Sea Effective #2.1 (IMDB)An uncle is forced to take care of his teenage nephew after the boy's father dies.My opinion: This movie is heart rending. The acting is spectacular. I have two main issues. The first is that Lee‚Äôs character doesn‚Äôt really take an arc. This makes the film see like its treading water. This is realisitic, but ultimately makes it seem unfulfilling at some level. It could have been a shot at the end showing some appreciation, or some level of catharsis. The second thing I didn‚Äôt love was the cinematography, which felt a bit cheap. Some of the shots were done with bad conditions. There was a lack of clarity in some of the shots and a general feeling that the film looked digital. Small quibbles, but it left me with a final score of 9/10.4. Arrival Effective: #4.4 (IMDB)Linguistics professor Louise Banks (Amy Adams) leads an elite team of investigators when gigantic spaceships touch down in 12 locations around the world. As nations teeter on the verge of global war, Banks and her crew must race against time to find a way to communicate with the extraterrestrial visitors. Hoping to unravel the mystery, she takes a chance that could threaten her life and quite possibly all of mankind.My opinion: This is one of the best science fiction movies of all time. It has unique takes on the characters involved with an alien encounter. The use of time is something that I haven‚Äôt seen in a movie before. 9/105. Hell or High Water Effective #5.4 (IMDB)Toby is a divorced father who's trying to make a better life for his son. His b..."
689,"I think it‚Äôs important to understand some basics about black money before judging this giant decision by the government.When we hear ‚ÄòBlack money‚Äô what most of us imagine is this:And conclude that this is ‚Äòevil‚Äô or ‚Äòbad‚Äô and hence must be cleaned up. And that is all there is to ‚ÄòBlack money‚Äô.The truth is this hoard of cash might be completely legitimate, even if it hidden under a bed - if it has been disclosed to the government and taxes have been paid for it. Then it is white moneyMoney = Cash?I might store all my money(black or white) in bank deposits, or in the form of cash at home - if that makes me happy. I might use it for charitable purposes or to throw a booze party or for a lavish wedding. That‚Äôs my right.Money can take the form of cash, real estate, gold or whatever.The only question which makes it black or white is: Have the requisite taxes been paid?If taxes are not paid, then it becomes black money. Now I need to hide this money. Surely bank deposits are not a good idea! If I buy something using this money I need to hide that too. So I buy big things in somebody else‚Äôs name(benami transactions), stash it in offshore accounts(which promise secrecy), invest in real estate(by showing lesser value) etc.Note that the cash component is a small part of the total money - especially If I have huge amounts of black money. It is simply impractical to hoard it all in cash.So ‚Äòmoney‚Äô is NOT the same as CashSo when we say our stated aim is ‚ÄòTo curb black money‚Äô we are not just hunting for hoards of cash. We are not even hunting for people with lots of real estate, or politicians who have a lot of gold. People can legitimately hold on to all that.We are hunting for hoards of cash, or people with lots of real estate, or politicians who have a lot of gold - who have not paid the taxes on it. And then collect those taxes. And perhaps impose heave penalties to prevent recurrence.But even this catches existing black money. The real solution is to make everybody pay taxes. But maybe catching existing black cash is also a good first step‚Ä¶So let‚Äôs analyse how useful this step is.Coming to demonetisation, two things to understand:It directly affects only the cash component of money. Not the real estate, gold etc. that I have. And that too, the part that is in form of 500 or 1000 notes.It affects black and white cash. You and me had white money but still were forced to deposit it in banks.So to judge effectiveness of the demonetisation scheme, we should try to calculate how much of the money is in CASH, and is black, and will be collected - and compare it against the total black money.A - Domestic black money‚ÄúAs Schneider estimates, using the dynamic multiple-indicators multiple-causes method and by currency demand method, that the size of India's black money economy is between 23 and 26%‚ÄùSource: Indian black money - WikipediaLet us assume it is 25%‚ÄúThe Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in India was worth 2073.54 billion US dollars in 2015‚ÄùSource: India GDPThis translates to 141 Lakh crores. 25% of this is about 35 Lakh crores.B - Offshore black money‚ÄúIn March 2012, the government of India clarified in its parliament that the CBI director's statement on $500 billion of illegal money[in foreign tax havens] was an estimate based on a statement made to India's Supreme Court in July 2011‚Äù Source: Indian black money - WikipediaThis translates to about 34 Lakh croresTotal black money = A + B = 35 + 34 = 69 Lakh croresThe question now is: How much of this black money is in cash and circulating inside India in form of 500 and 1000 Rs notes, which the demonetisation scheme might recover?C - Total currency in 500 and 1000 Rs. notes = 14 Lakh crores‚Äúthe annual report of Reserve Bank of India (RBI) of 31 March 2016 stated that total bank notes in circulation valued to ‚Çπ16.42 lakh crore (US$240 billion) of which nearly 86% (around ‚Çπ14.18 lakh cror..."
690,"A good photo is one that is visually pleasing and has an original quality. But..It's a subjective question so there is no one right answer. It's also relative to how you're measuring what's good and what's not so good. A good photo in your collection may not be considered good if it is viewed in a magazine along side good photographs taken by other people. Here's an example of what I judge to be a good photo:There is very little to criticize about this photo. Sure it can be improved but it's a good photo.Here's an example of photo taken of another robin but I don't think it's a good photo:There are many things to criticize with this one. It's not a good photo IMO. But the person who took it may think it's good. The first example of the robin in the snow is much better when judged relative to this one. The main differences in the two shots are:better composition in the snowy picture. It follows more the rule of thirds. The focal point (the robin's eyes, head and chest) is too far towards the top in the second image. better background in the first example.better context in the first one. It's not everyday we see a beautiful robin surrounded by snow in our gardens. Snow is seasonal and it doesn't snow everywhere every year so a lot of people rarely see this scene in their garden. Whereas the second image is an everyday occurrence that anyone can see. And it's not original really in any way.The snowy robin picture is far superior technically. Resolution, sharpness, depth of field compliments the subject, nicer colours and is framed better.The first image is much cleaner. The robin looks more beautiful and is perfectly sharp. The rest of the image is pristine snow, a hint of a tree stump and an ideal background.The photographer who took the first one knew what they were doing and had much more expensive gear.A¬† photo can be judged as being good even if it doesn't meet the high¬† technical and compositional qualities that would usually be found in¬† professionally taken pictures. Because photography is an art it is¬† possible to take a visually pleasing photo taken with a crappy camera of¬† an everyday subject.Here's an example of a good photo that is technically poor (aside from composition) and is underexposed:The photographer achieved an artistic quality through underexposure and purposely tilting his iPhone and framing the woman nicely about one third from the left and her head is roughly one third from the top. To me the darkness in the picture is artistic. It's sort of unknown exactly what's across the street. Also it is thought provoking and makes me look at the image and wonder what it is that's going on.Here is what the image looks like when levels are adjusted and shows roughly what it would have been like had he correctly exposed the shot:I much prefer the first image. If the original picture was correctly exposed there would be much less artistic quality and it would not be as good."
691,"People run away for many reasons in their lives and probably none are any good reasons to do so. In running away people do this as a spur of the moment thing that they hope will solve what ever is going on in their lives.¬† Unfortunitly it usually causes more troubles than it is worth for them. It is true that many of these persons have a real need to get away for a brief period of time,yet, in that time there can develope more issues than what they were dealing with in the first place. To me running away from home is a quick fix for all that is going on in someones life. Beyond this there is not a whole lot else to it. It is mostly emotions that are out of control at these periods when the choice to run away is made. Once one does this then there is a passage of these emotions from you and one is left with the question of what to do next?¬†¬†¬†¬† I can understand the need to get away for awhile to clear the mind of all which is on it,but, in a way this to can be done with out running away from home. I suppose the only real reason that does make any sense to me for running away is if your life is being threatened. Fear for ones safety transcends all else and thus running away from home for a period of time; for protection is about the only real reasoning to this situation."
692,"Access Modifiers are like entry gates for other classes i.e. a class can control what information or data can be accessible by other classes.Java provides a number of access modifiers to help you set the level of access you want for classes as well as the fields, methods and constructors in your classes. A member has package or default accessibility when no accessibility modifier is specified.Types of Access Modifiers1. private2. protected3. default4. publicThe following table shows the access to members permitted by each modifier.The first data column indicates whether the class itself has access to the member defined by the access level. As you can see, a class always has access to its own members. The second column indicates whether classes in the same package as the class (regardless of their parentage) have access to the member. The third column indicates whether subclasses of the class declared outside this package have access to the member. The fourth column indicates whether all classes have access to the member.Tips on Choosing an Access Level: If other programmers use your class, you want to ensure that errors from misuse cannot happen. Access levels can help you do this.Use the most restrictive access level that makes sense for a particular member. Use private unless you have a good reason not to.Avoid public fields except for constants. (Many of the examples in the tutorial use public fields. This may help to illustrate some points concisely, but is not recommended for production code.) Public fields tend to link you to a particular implementation and limit your flexibility in changing your code."

695,"I would like to answer this question in 2 parts.Is Tetanus likely in this injury ? The answer is NO... Tetanus will commonly occur in deep wounds since it needs a lack of oxygen (anaerobic) environment to survive. So rusted nail injuries that are deep are perfect for causing tetanus, while superficial bruises are not likely to cause tetanus.Should you take a tetanus shot? Well, if you have not taken a tetanus shot in the last 10 years, please go ahead and take one. This is because you should ideally be vaccinated BEFORE an injury, and protection against Tetanus works for 10 years. So this tetanus shot will protect you against ANY injury in the next 10 years ...Warm regardsDr Gaurav Gupta, MD"

Dogs love to be mentally stimulated, so good on you for wanting to teach your dog new things.In dog training, there are basically two main areas that you want to spend your time learning about, even if only briefly:Classical conditioning:Where dogs make associations between things subconsciously (the famous Pavlov‚Äôs dogs experiment).This isn‚Äôt exactly what you‚Äôre looking for, so I won‚Äôt spend too much time on it right now, but it can be incredibly useful to know, because it‚Äôs constantly at play. I thought I‚Äôd throw it in for the sake of completion.What you should look into is Operant Conditioning:Every police K9, military working dog, bomb sniffer and TV canine actor you‚Äôve seen has been trained via operant conditioning.This opens up the dog‚Äôs world to the concept of consequences. For any particular behaviour your dog performs, he may be reinforced or punished for it.Reinforcement: the promotion of a behaviour, in order to increase its likelihood of happening again.Punishment: the discouragement of a behaviour in order to decrease its likelihood of happening again.Further still, you can give(+) or take something away(-) from the dog in each case, referred to as positive and negative respectively So now we have this:Positive reinforcement: Giving your dog something desirable, in order to reward and promote a behaviour, eg. praising him for coming to you.Negative reinforcement: Taking something aversive away from your dog in order to reward and promote a behaviour, eg. removing pressure from their neck when they do what you want them to (old school dog training method).Positive punishment: Giving or applying something aversive to your dog to penalise and discourage a behaviour, eg. using traditional prong and choke collars to apply pressure to their neck when they do something you don‚Äôt like.Negative punishment: Taking something desirable away from your dog to penalise or discourage a behaviour, eg. turning your back when he jumps up for attention.These are the basic building blocks in dog training, and with them you can teach your dog pretty much anything they‚Äôre physically capable of doing.Timing is essential, because dogs live in the moment - so you want to reinforce or punish within seconds of the behaviour occurring, otherwise it‚Äôs a wasted effort.Consistency is everything in dog training.

701,"Not exactly. Dark and white meat, in chickens, is related to how much work that body part does - since chickens don‚Äôt do much flying, their chest muscles (the breast meat) doesn‚Äôt get much exercise.Since they aren‚Äôt flying, however, their leg muscles get a lot of work. This means that their leg muscles are much tougher, especially compared to their chest.Humans, however, use both our arms and our legs. So a better comparison would be to look at an animal that uses all four limbs - pigs are usually used for this, since they‚Äôre surprisingly similar to humans. And in an animal that uses all four of its limbs about equally, you don‚Äôt see white or dark meat; some parts would be tougher if the muscle for that area has seen a lot of use - so athletes would have much tougher leg or arm muscles than a sedentary office worker - but there isn‚Äôt usually a drastic difference in the texture and colour."

703,"Origins of CSThe primary difference is that computer science was originally a sub-branch of mathematics. This is now known as theoretical computer science. Modern applied computer science deals with algorithms and software. Where hardware is studied it is only to inform the design and development of algorithms and software. As such computer science can either be extremely mathematical and focus only on graph theory, combinatorics, computational complexity theory, axiomatic set theory and propositional logic. OR it can be more applied as is the case almost universally in university programmes.Origins of CEComputer engineering has very different origins as a sub-branch of electronic engineering, which itself is a sub-branch of electrical engineering. Electrical engineering itself emerged as a specialisation from engineering science at the turn of the 20th century.In fact, even within electronic engineering the field of computer engineering emerges as a sub-branch of digital electronics. This is generally regarded as the ""easier"" electronics in the field, and stands in sharp contrast to analogue electronics which is legendarily difficult. Difficulty of CS vs CEI agree with the first half of answer Ken's answer but I don't entirely agree with his views on what's harder and what's not. It is true that in many countries engineering degrees tend to be harder or more rigorous than science degrees because it is, simultaneously, a science degree while also aiming to certify the practitioner and satisfy the professional requirements for admission to whatever necessary governing bodies. In the UK the engineering degrees are designed to be both academic enough to serve as a platform for further research while also meeting the stringent requirements to receive the title of Chartered Engineer with IMechE, IChemE, IEE (now, IET), etc. Hence, professionally accredited degrees in the UK are the BEng or MEng rather than the BSc or MSc. (Though an MEng is fundamentally different from an MSc too, but let's not get into that.)But as far as the fields themselves are concerned I don't think a broad generalization can be made. Some topics in computer science are of extraordinary difficulty. In fact the P vs NP problem in computer currently stands as one of the greatest open problems in mathematics. The solution of which would guarantee a Fields Medal. Though, engineering science has its own equally difficult open problems such as the Yang-Mills existence and mass gap which is in the domain of electrical engineering, and the Navier-Stokes existence and smoothness problem which is in fluid mechanics. (These three are Millenium Prize problems.)Certainly, web development and database design can be considered ""easier"" than, say, VLSI or transmission line analysis, so ""computer science"" can be said to have easier topics, however there are also many very difficult topics in the field. (Furthermore, I question the classification of such topics as computer science. True computer science is theoretical computer science.)Difficulty of CE vs EEEOne idea in Ken's answer that I reject is the idea that computer engineering is somehow more difficult than electrical engineering. This cannot be the case when one contains the other. Furthermore, this cannot be the case when computer engineering traditionally avoids or glosses over some of the most difficult topics in the field with which students struggle the most. These being, engineering electromagnetics and analogue electronics. One could call computer engineering a specialisation within digital electronics, and digital electronics is orders of magnitude easier and better understood than analogue.PickingIn my case, I intentionally avoided picking the sub-specialization of computer engineering and stuck¬† to general EEE because I found several of the easier courses were in the CE specialization, and because I had encountered most of the CE specific courses in CS. E.g. I really didn't need yet another course about networks. The one on designing radio telescopes was much more interesting.One thing I must point out, however. It is a lot easier to teach yourself computer science than it is to teach yourself computer engineering because there is less of a strong reliance on background/prerequisites between topics in CS and less experimentation with real-world phenomena that can behave unpredictably -- I can't count the number of times an analogue signal conditioning circuit was displaying fine on the oscilloscope before lunch but mysteriously stopped working after. So if you want to have less limits, study computer engineering and fill in the gaps of whatever area of CS or software engineering that you need."
704,"The best time for sex varies, depending on your gender. So while you might be up for it first thing in the morning, your partner might not want it until later at night. Finding the perfect time for sex can be difficult, but once you do, you‚Äôll have a fantastic time.Morning sex - As others have stated, most men will reach their peak testosterone levels early in the morning. Women experience a similar peak in endorphins, though not as extreme or as early (usually between 8am and 10am). This means that you could easily enjoy some shower sex just before you go to work!Mid-aftenoon - Lunchtime tends not to be a great time to have sex. Most of us are in a bit of a slump from work, and so sex is the last thing on our mind. However, at 3pm, women will experience a spike in cortisol levels, giving them more energy. Men will find that their estrogen levels rise, making them more focused. If you need a break from work, meeting up for a quickie seems like the perfect way to do it!Evening time - Immediately after work usually isn‚Äôt a good time for sex. We are stressed, tired, and just want to relax. When the night draws to a close, it is a different matter entirely. A lot of women will feel completely re-energised between the hours of 8pm and 10pm, and sex is a great way to get rid of this excess energy. Plus, sex before bed can help you to get a good night‚Äôs sleep.A lot of the time it will depend on your schedule. If you and your partner are both too busy to have sex at the optimal times, you might have to figure out a compromise. Really, whenever you both want sex is the best time for it, so talk to your partner and find out when they are at their horniest."
705,"The problem with free horoscope website is, it will give you some random details, although there is very less chance of accuracy. Because, the horoscope generated by an automated code is far different from horoscope generated by an expert astrologer. Free horoscope, itself signifies that, you are looking for personal satisfaction or entertainment, rather than, looking for actual solution to your problem.People don‚Äôt respect something as much when it‚Äôs free, because they don‚Äôt have personal stake on it. If someone, wants to change their fate, look for marriage making, or thinking about opening a business, then this free mindset won‚Äôt help you much. Which is why, paid consultation with an expert astrologer, helps you to focus, since you have put money on it.There are many platforms, but I‚Äôd recommend Askmonk.

710,"Wired ethernet is about an order of magnitude lower ping time for machines on the same network (i.e. single hop). For example, on my home network, I see approximately 0.3ms wired ethernet ping vs 3ms wireless ethernet ping. This is because of the more extensive error checking and protocol requirements of wifi. More importantly, however, wired ethernet has much lower ""jitter"" or variation in the ping time. Because of interference from microwaves, other devices using a shared spectrum, usage of nearby channels, etc, there is a much greater variation in the ping time over wifi. Of course, if you are using local wifi to connect to a router connected to the Internet, it is important to remember that the wifi is the last link, and it may not make much of a difference if your ping time to the server you are interested in is much greater."
711,I am an Indian planning to pursue my MS in Computer Science. I have a great passion towards programming and research and am currently passing from 6th to 7th semester of my B.tech CSE course. How do I take the next step?
712,"Evolution is wonderfully unpredictable. A million years ago, if you were plopped down in Africa and asked which animal would soon become the dominant species, I pretty much guarantee you wouldn't have selected the soft little hominid with the big head and funny gait. So any answer you get is going to be highly speculative.The reason we became the dominant species on Earth is this:Unlike our competitors, we started walking upright. And then we started running. By becoming the world's elite long distance runner, we ensured that we could kill and eat high protein animals that were faster than us, but that couldn't keep running as long as we could. Once we could do that, our brains got bigger as a result and the rest is history... tools, language, agriculture, and so on...So who's next? Accepting that we have no idea which evolutionary leap (like upright walking) may lead to the next dominant species, we can at least guess based on a few assumptions:1. The overall ecosystem of Earth is more complex and sophisticated now than it was when bacteria, trilobytes, or even dinosaurs were the dominant species. This means that unless there's another massive die-off, the next dominant species will likely be highly adaptable, if not extra-ordinarily intelligent (and likely self-aware).2. There are a bunch of species that are quite deeply evolved, since they evolved along side us. As such, they don't have anywhere near as far to go as we humans had to evolve. In some cases, I suspect if humans disappeared, a few candidates would just need a couple hundred thousand years and some luck to end up in a similar situation to us.3. True success and dominance at this point probably requires evolution of a means of force multiplication. That means evolving tools and/or behaviors that maximize the production/collection of food. This probably requires several or all of the following traits:Sociability - loners don't develop sophisticated social queues or tools. So most strict carnivores like big cats, even though they usually physically superior, are poor candidates for evolutionary dominance on modern Earth.Dexterity - Lack of fine motor skills makes it very hard to do the whole tool, agriculture, dominance path thing. Note: ""hands"" aren't required, but a highly dextrous body extension seems critical to me. Octopus arms, Elephant trunks could work. The key is a non-locomotive manipulator ""hand"".Access to fire - Sorry, dolphins and octopuses. While its certainly possible for smarter aquatic life to become dominant below the waves, it's hard to imagine any cetacean or cephalopod evolving to dominate outside their world. That's not to say one of them might not ""rule the waves"" so to speak.Decent life-span - Moreso than being stuck in saltwater, this is really why Octopi are a bad candidate. 2-3 year lifespans are not the stuff of global dominance.So we're looking for smart, adaptable, non-aquatic social animals in need of just an evolutionary jump or two to take them over the top. If they already use tools, that's a good sign. If they already use complex group-based food gathering tactics, that's another good sign.My candidates:Chimps and Bonobos - Our closest relatives are the obvious choice. Tool users. Highly social. There's a reason ""Planet of the Apes"" was popular. It doesn't take much imagination to envision these guys taking over the world. For ever other species' sake, let's hope its the Bonobos, not the Chimps. Much like us, chimps are assholes. Baboons and Orangutans - Large, social old-world monkeys are probably next up, for similar reasons. Baboons in particular interest me because of their higher levels of environmental adaptability.Gorillas - Size may limit them to certain habitats now, but one could imagine them learning how to make their favorite foods more available over time and spring-boarding from there. Sorry, but for the short-term,..."
713,"There is a constant need for better quality production procedures in mechanized sector of textile industry. Hence, companies prefer hiring candidates specialized in this domain. It is one of the most demanded careers as there is always a need of better fire resistant materials, material for medical use and weather resistant packaging materials etc.Candidates with a degree in Textile Engineering can get involved in textile chemistry that is responsible for coming up with different types of fabrics with specific properties. Apart from this, a textile engineer also works in quality department to monitor the production processes to ensure the produced product is of superior quality.

714,"Fastest could mean a lot of different things.People have posted a lot of cars on here that are the fastest production cars, but probably not the fastest cars that are road-legal. Tuner cars can be faster than even the fastest hypercar, because there‚Äôs really no need to worry about reliability, aesthetics, or ease-of-manufacture.There are two different good definitions of ‚Äúfast‚Äù where I can start looking for road-legal cars: Top speed and acceleration.Top speed for a production car is easy; that‚Äôs just how fast a car goes. The fastest ‚Äúproduction‚Äù car is the Bugatti Veyron Super Sport, which reaches a top speed of 267.85 mph (431.06 kph):It gets a little harder if you want to find the top speed of a road legal car. Most top speed racing doesn‚Äôt check that the car is road-legal, so it‚Äôs hard to verify a record. However, I‚Äôm going to use the Modified- and Factory-class Bonneville Salt Flats records, which are maintained by the Southern California Timing Association. The fastest record that I could find for a modified production car was by a 1990‚Äôs Pontiac Trans-Am running nitrous injection (and probably a motor swap) at 308.98 mph (497.26 kph):For acceleration, the most reliable measure of ‚Äúfastest‚Äù would be a 1/4-mi (400m) drag race. People like to quote 0‚Äì60 mph (0‚Äì100 kph) times, but tuner cars have become so fast that the difference is hard to measure accurately.Just for fun, the fastest production car 0‚Äì60 mph is the Porsche 918 Spyder, at 2.2 sec, followed closely enough to mention by the Tesla Model S P100D Ludicrous+ at 2.28 sec:The fastest production car to do a 1/4 mile is, again, the Bugatti Veyron Super Sport, and it does it in 9.7 sec (speed unlisted, but probably ~150 mph):The fastest 1/4 mile by a road legal car is a very sought-after record in the USA, and tends to change from year to year, and sometimes month-to-month. In 2016 it was held by a modified 1969 Chevrolet Camaro, which ran a quarter-mile in 5.85 sec at 251 mph:To all the naysayers of this particular record (the car certainly doesn‚Äôt look road-legal), this car participates in an event called Hot Rod Drag Week. All Drag Week vehicles are required to drive under their own power from track to track to compete. It is registered and completely road-legal, and you can see the registration sticker in the windshield on videos of it running.Hope that answers your question!"
715,"The best mined material for a permanent and scary powerful magnet is neodymium. I‚Äôm not a scientist so you may wish to google the specifics. All I know is that I bought tiny neodymium magnets on eBay before realizing their potentially destructive magnetic force. A one inch cube stuck to my dryer side and I needed to pry it off. Two of these could crush a finger. In tiny sizes, neodymium magnets could be used in everyday items where you don‚Äôt want the magnet to lose its strength over time. Neodymium is also used in electric car batteries, but its dirty mining and scarcity pushed for other environmentally greener solutions."
716,"Teshan, you cannot change the question from What is the meaning of absolute value in mathematics? into What is ""true value"" in mathematics? without informing the previous responders who provided their answers to your question. Ok!?Anyway, please see the below answers for the absolute value for both reals and complex numbers. I would add an example though: assume someone has a debit card with $10 on it and a credit card with $10 on it. This implies that the absolute value of these two cards is the same (i.e., 10), while mathematically speaking the value of the debit card is 10, but the value of the credit card is -10. However because |-10| = |10|, the sentence ‚ÄúHey, I have a credit card with $10 on it‚Äù means that it is a negative number (in real world, you‚Äôll have to pay it back to the bank :( ).As for your question, What is ""true value"" in mathematics?, this is a previous Quora enquiry.

717,"First and foremost, you would need to become a U.S. citizen. The rest of the basic eligibility requirements are here: Special Agents | FBIJOBS.Other than that, it's impossible to answer (briefly) in the abstract. In part, because there are so many avenues, not to mention an element of luck, to getting hired. And especially because the Bureau's roster of needs and hiring process can change massively over the course of 10-15 years (which is when you would likely be applying): today's Bureau is in many ways very different from its pre-9/11 mission. The most likely constant will be a preference for applicants with foreign language skills, native fluency especially. (Also, don't take a job working directly for your current or any other foreign government.)Honestly, the Bureau probably doesn't do anything your country‚Äôs own law enforcement, domestic security, and intelligence agencies don't themselves do already (at least collectively).FYI, I'm a huge fan of young women having an early look at law enforcement and intelligence work. Perhaps the best advice is to find stuff that fascinates you, that you are good at, and would want to be even better at in the future. As an example: I know an agent who liked acting, fell in love with Shakespeare, became fascinated by the authorship question, all of which lead to a career as a lawyer specializing in forensic linguistics and (eventually) his getting hired by the Bureau."

And there are others like me. I know you‚Äôll want to know what it‚Äôs like there, but honestly you wouldn‚Äôt understand.‚Äù‚ÄúOh,‚Äù you said, a little let down. ‚ÄúBut wait.

You‚Äôre asking me for the meaning of life? Isn‚Äôt that a little stereotypical?‚Äù‚ÄúWell it‚Äôs a reasonable question,‚Äù you persisted.I looked you in the eye. ‚ÄúThe meaning of life, the reason I made this whole universe, is for you to mature.‚Äù‚ÄúYou mean mankind? You want us to mature?‚Äù‚ÄúNo, just you. I made this whole universe for you. With each new life you grow and mature and become a larger and greater intellect.‚Äù‚ÄúJust me? What about everyone else?‚Äù‚ÄúThere is no one else,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúIn this universe, there‚Äôs just you and me.‚Äù You stared blankly at me. ‚ÄúBut all the people on earth‚Ä¶‚Äù‚ÄúAll you.

Every act of kindness you‚Äôve done, you‚Äôve done to yourself. Every happy and sad moment ever experienced by any human was, or will be, experienced by you.‚ÄùYou thought for a long time. ‚ÄúWhy?‚Äù You asked me. ‚ÄúWhy do all this?‚Äù‚ÄúBecause someday, you will become like me.

726,"To those who haven't traveled in an non air-conditioned railway coach (generally referred to as a sleeper coach) in India, I apologize for my choice of metaphor here. To give a bit of a background, more than half the reserved coaches in India are non-AC. They are generally messier, filthier, hotter, more crowded, and generally more of an unpleasant experience than their air conditioned counterparts.Imagine such a journey. You board the train at 8 AM in the morning, settle down, and feel yourself being slowly engulfed with excitement and hopeful anticipation. It is going to be a long trip; 24 hours to be precise. But the prospect of going back to your hometown, or seeing your lover after a long time, or starting a new chapter in a strange city, or any of the multitude of reasons you undertook this voyage, would certainly make up for it. Its almost noon. Things have been smooth for the past 4 hours. The weather's fine, but it is definitely getting hotter. Your coach is only ~50% occupied. You have already finished the book you had purchased earlier, at the onset of the journey. To be fair, it was a disappointment. However, it did help you kill a few hours. But you are no longer in the mood to read more, so you do not take out the second one, letting it sit idly in your backpack, hopefully to be picked up during the return leg.The first big station arrives. A great human wave overwhelms your compartment. In a few minutes, when the commotion subsides, and the train resumes nonchalantly, you realize that there are now more people than seats. A lot of people without the proper reservations have also got in. But being in India, there is nothing much you can do about it. An elderly gentleman comes up to you and asks you to shift a bit to accommodate him. You are well within your rights to refuse, but you don't want to sound rude. So you comply; you adjust. Another 3 hours pass by. The heat has become unbearable. You curse our little, ordinary, yellow star. You notice that another young man has somehow sneaked into your seat. Originally meant to seat 3, it now is carrying 5. There isn't enough room for you to get comfortable. Not fair, you think. After all you planned your travel in advance and paid for the seat. So you take a stand, and politely ask the gentleman to leave. It's 6 PM now. The sun has started to go down. You have become accustomed to the crowd, the crying children, the noisy group of teenagers in the next compartment, and everything else. The guy you had asked to leave earlier comes back, walks up to you, and apologizes. He is a student, who had to suddenly leave for home due to a personal emergency. He says his stop is next. And that he is terribly sorry for the inconvenience he caused you. You feel like an ass. You realize you had been a terrible person. You blurt out your apology too, hoping to make up for your earlier blunder. You offer him half you seat until his journey ends. You start talking. He is a good kid. 30 minutes or so fly by in what felt like a jiffy. You bid adieu but not without adding him on Facebook. You just made a friend. 7 PM and you are gazing our of the window. The cool counter-breeze is a welcome relief after the sun's unsolicited display of strength earlier that day. The scenery is wonderful too. Lush green fields, small lakes and ponds, a tiny creek, a rustic little settlement. You can almost feel the languid rural life calling out to you, a stark contrast against the hectic pace of the city. Is that regret you are feeling?Anyway, back to the present. Some of the scenery is so beautiful, you wish you could stop and admire it for a few moments more. But like Frost's reminiscence of a fateful winter evening passing through the woods, or Wordsworth's vivid memoirs of gazing upon a daffodil field, you know it isn't possible. Everything comes, stays for a while, and then leaves. Nothing is permanent. With that thought, both distressing and comforting, you eat your dinner and go to sleep. You wake up at 6 AM the next morning, mostly infuriated by the commotion in the coach. To your pleasant surprise, you find a cute girl sitting across from your seat. Being shy, you simply take out the second book and start reading. A few minutes later, the lady interrupts you inquiring about the said book. Not a bad investment, you think. One thing leads to another, and you soon find yourself in the midst of a wonderful conversation. You are pleasantly surprised to discover that the two of you work in the same city, belong to the same town, and have overlapping interests in most cases. ""Could this be love?"", you heart asks. ""Let's not get ahead of ourselves."", your brain replies. However, it definitely could be the beginning of something wonderful. You exchange numbers and outline some vague plans to catch up soon.The journey is coming to an end. You feel both relieved and a bit nostalgic. You are where you wanted to be, but in the process you will have to let go of the past 24 hours. That is life. A journey. A series of events, some memorable some not. An emotional roller-coaster of joy, sadness, excitement, disappointment. A constant battle between being a little sympathetic and understanding vs standing your ground. Friendship. Love. An elapsing sequence of scenes, of moments, of memories. All of them fleeting. Permanently. Irrevocably. The final destination for all is the same - irrespective of power, wealth, beauty, ambition. Death is the eventual finality that we all need to embrace and accept. However, it's the ephemeral nanosecond in the cosmic calendar, where you exist, that is all that matters. "
727,So there was this event call Comic Fiesta (CF). They have this event every end of the year. This even is those anime cosplaying stuff and I really wanted to go. At first I was so excited but I had no one to go with me. so I invited my friends if they can go with me and we can have fun. they said they are all not going. so I decide to not go as well. I didnt buy the ticket. and one that 2 days event all of them (those who said they were not going) went to the event. they even took pictures. I felt betrayed.. what should I do..

729,"Why is salt water taffy candy imported in the United Kingdom?Is it? Never seen it anywhere. I only know the term from old Scooby Doo episodes.We don't have the word ‚ÄúTaffy‚Äù here, so if anyone wants taffy (rather than toffee or fudge), they would need to make it or import it.I asked an American living here what it was and I seem to remember she said it was softer than toffee, but not the same as fudge. If so, it might be different enough to import some, but probably not different enough to displace those two very popular types of traditional sweets*. If there aren't many people who want it, its unlikely to be economic to make it here. Especially if part of its appeal is in being a traditional american sweet.*I like bonfire toffee the best. You could definitely break a tooth on it though!"
730,"I have a section of a speech, in which I say ‚Äúfor you gringos in the audience, don‚Äôt go to Johannesburg and try this yourself.‚ÄùThe ‚Äútry this‚Äù is, essentially, walking in any of the public market areas in poor neighborhoods to the northeast of the city center, where they would be the only white person within many blocks, but really stand out like a sore thumb due to demeanor and expectations.That section of my presentation ends with ‚ÄúI really love being there, because you can forget all the pressures of thinking about race in the US.‚Äù But of course, most of the US-American whites in my audience, would get themselves robbed or killed on those streets.They‚Äôd do it by not fitting it. They‚Äôd do it not, by not fitting in by the color of their skin‚Äî but by how they act, their demeanor, the constant arrogance, the assertiveness and assumptions of their body language, stance and movements. They‚Äôd do it by not recognizing others, and being 100% oblivious to who is carrying a deadly weapon‚Äî and for that matter, 100% oblivious to what a deadly weapon can be, on the streets of a place like Joburg.Mexico City gets a bad rap. Statistically, since 2002 or so, Mexico City is much safer than the urban United States. Roughly, about twice as safe. Even before then, the sensationalization of violence in Mexico by the United States, was also a matter of racism and nationalism.One of the other respondent below, points out an aspect of Mexican culture and violence that is very important but rarely noted: the nature of race in Mexico.If you look and act like like a conquistadore, in some situations you may will receive a great deal of deference and respect. In others, you will be resented. Step into a local neighborhood filled with the descendants of the Aztecs at dusk, and you may find yourself re-enacting a ritual sacrifice, as the guest of honour. (Heck its a bit more complex, but there‚Äôs no time for a lecture on ritual grammar and the nature of tamales in Nahuatl.)Another thing many US-Americans may miss, is that as ‚Äògringos‚Äô [note, the foregoing is a potential racially derisive term, and not being used in that sense] they are not usually on top of the racial hierarchy. The descendants of the Aztecs tend to look at their culture as number One. The Spanish conquistadores are number Two. And in the third culture which resulted, being identified as the second, can mean you‚Äôre on top of society‚Äî most of Mexico‚Äôs power and wealth is controlled by about twenty families ‚Äî or it can mean, you‚Äôre a hostile invader to be expelled or killed.Complex, isn‚Äôt it? We‚Äôre just scratching the surface. For many in Mexico today, the United States and its material and other successes, are something to be looked up to and aspired to. For many others, the United States is a terrible place, filled with cold temperatures and colder people, an exploitative imperial aggressor responsible for much of Mexico‚Äôs poverty and decline.Just scratching the surface. There is little time or space here, to spend on the ideas and ideology of socialist Mexico and the Mexican left‚Äî that the United States is a capitalist aggressor, on the one hand, and that Mexico‚Äôs schools should only teach literature and self-development, not science and industry, so that students won‚Äôt become cogs in the capitalist machine.But the latter, too, has much to do with cycles of poverty and violence, the stalls of Latin American economies, and the failures of all sides to move forward.But ‚Äúwhy is Mexico City so violent‚Äù?Why is Memphis Tennessee so violent? Why is New Orleans so violent? Why are Baltimore and Philadelphiaso violent? Why is West Oaklandso violent? Why are US-American films, and television, so violent?And why do US-Americans go on so about the problems of other places, when their own problems are so much worse?"

732,"Certainly most assertions of String Theory are untestable. The extra dimensions it asserts are curled so tightly -- smaller than the diameter of a proton -- that we just don't have the ability to probe them.It's like beings in a one-dimensional universe postulating that instead of a line, their universe is actually a cylinder, and they are actually two-dimensional beings wrapped around it. But it's so small in diameter, that their universe is indistinguishable from a line.There are also theories that postulate that gravity is leaking into or out of our universe from other dimensions. This one is especially frustrating, because the distance at which this begins to happen is actually on the order of a visible fraction of a millimeter. We can actually see with our naked eye the scale at which gravity is thought to begin leaking. But gravity is so weak that we don't have the ability to measure it at such small -- even though they're visible -- distances. At the distances we're talking about, other forces come into play, making measurement of gravity pretty much impossible.Membrane Theory suggests that there are perhaps innumerable parallel universes of varying dimensions in an arbitrarily high-dimension realm. Each universe is a membrane, and ours just happens to be three spatial dimensions. When another membrane collided with ours almost 14 billion years ago, that provided the quantum disturbance that created the Big Bang.The quantum multiverse theory suggests that for every quantum probability wave collapse that has occurred, there is another universe for every possible wave collapse that could otherwise have happened. So if an electron is seen to exist in this spot here, there is another set of universes in which the electron is seen to exist somewhere else. And so on. On the macro scale, this means that for every fork in the road you encounter, every decision you make, there is another universe in which you made a different choice. But it's so mind-bogglingly much more than that since it's governed at the subatomic level for every particle in the entire universe, and not at the macro level. In effect, it says that every universe that can possibly exist from this moment on, does exist somewhere. But, alas, we might never gain the ability to test this since other universes are spectacularly inaccessible.Wormholes, or Einstein-Rosen Bridges, seem to be allowed by General Relativity. And General Relativity has proven to be incredibly successful at making predictions that turned out to be spot-on accurate. So few physicists doubt that wormholes are possible in our universe.But creating them requires god-like command of mind-boggling quantities of matter and energy. This one is rather cool, because most of us believe that wormholes are something the universe actually allows.Alas."

Yes, I believe that respect is something which will earn you value of being alive but money is what you need actually for begin alive! This is not a question that philosophy can answer! This is quite practical matter!Without respect, with lot of money, we can't live a satisfactory life! And without money, with lot of respect, same is true! Yes, practically respect can help you to earn money! But that will itch your self-respect a bit, which is not satisfying! Without any respect in the world, you will feel like a thing, so having lot of money can help you to survive but it will not help you to live happily!In my opinion, hardwork and honesty is more important than both money and respect!

734,"I wanted to answer this question since long but didn‚Äôt get any time.The legionAfter a couple of high-profile hacks, which even saw Rahul Gandhi losing access to his Twitter account and emails of many prominent people including journalist Barkha Dutt dumped out in the open, everyone is asking who is Legion. The hackers -- or is it just a lone wolf -- who have hacked Rahul Gandhi, Barkha Dutt, Vijay Mallya and now are going after Lalit Modi, claim that their group is called Legion. They have become active on Twitter and are supposedly threatening everyone in India who they believe is corrupt.""Okay Brothers we're back. #legion. Support our cause to expose the rats in our system,"" the Legion recently tweeted. The ""group"" also exhorts that people should expose the corrupt persons by leaking their details to Legion through an email id. The mail is hosted on SIGAINT, a fairly secure email service available to public.So who exactly are the guys -- or girls -- behind Legion and how they are hacking into the accounts of prominent people in India? The answer to first question is that we don't know. And it is fairly certain that anyone, other than probably a handful of people, really know at the moment. As for how they are doing it, the answer is again we don't know for sure.

735,"Should Education system be changed? yesHow?Answer:Remove English education completely: English was introduced by the British Raj, as a way to degrade our patriotism towards our own country, but after the damage caused by Mughal and British invasion, our Prakrit and Sanskrit education system was dumped, and even after 1947 independence we had no choice but to introduce English as ‚ÄòLink language‚Äô as Indian states are divided by languages. English is a foreign language, it does not share or care about the Indian culture, you cannot discriminate people respectively like ‚ÄúTu, Tum, Ap‚Äù in Hindi, and other languages, english is completely different.Introduce a new national language, such as Sanskrit: Sanskrit and Prakrit was always used in Ancient India, Brahmins made the most progress. For Example: Aryabhatta did all his works in Sanskrit(this is a fact). Sanskrit included the entire Hindu culture in a language, Making Sanskrit compulsory in all classes and even higher classes will help the students in knowing the national more efficiently.Remove british history and Mughal history, and introduce the might of the Indian emperors, their strength and wealth: British did their best to make us feel bad about our history, hence they introduced what caused our rulers fail to protect our own country.Make moral science as a subject compulsory till Class 8: Although this is already being followed in many school this is essential too.Re-Develop the Class rooms and provide appropriate maintenance: One of the basic infrastructural needs, if the schools are already hygienic, then it will simply attract students, except of repelling them."
736,"First of all , the question is which type of column you are using timber , concrete etc .Now a days RCC columns are widely used ,here is the detail about it.The size of the columns depends on the total load on the columns.Minimum size of the column should not be less than 9‚Äùx9‚Äù.9‚Äùx9‚Äù columns are to be used for a single storey structure with M15 (1:2:4) (cement : sand : aggregate ) grade of concrete.In case, 9‚Äùx9‚Äù column size is to be used for 1 and half storey structure, then it is advised to use M20 (1:1.5:3) (cement : sand : aggregate ) grade concrete.A safe and structurally sound column size for a 1 and half storey structure should not be less than 12‚Äùx9‚Äù using M15 grade concrete. This should be in your most preferred and practical options list.Distance between the columnsTry to maintain equal distance between the centres of two columns. Always plan a column layout on a grid.The distance between two columns of size 9‚Äùx9‚Äù should not be more than 4m centre to centre of column.If larger barrier free distances are required then going for larger column size is to be used.The size of the columns increase because of two factors:1 . Increase in the distance between two columns (This increases the dimensions of the columns as well the depth of the beam.)2 . Height of the building (Increase in the number of floors is directly proportional to the dimensions of the columns.Alignment of ColumnsA rectangular grid is to be made for placing the columns. This helps in avoiding mistakes and placing in columns can be done in the right way.The columns can preferably be arranged in two different fashions:1 . In a straight line with the help of a grid2 . In a circular fashion for circular buildings.Zigzag arrangement of columns is an absolutely wrong way of working out Structural design. It should be remembered that when columns are erected, beams are laid connecting the columns.The Zigzag column placement causes three major issues:1 . Unbalanced load transfer2 . Problems in wall construction3 . Problems in laying beams (This picture shows a rough design of columns for multistory buildings )"
737,"In English, we would have often use the word ‚ÄúCome‚Äù and ‚Äúreturn‚Äù and all of us know their meaning as well. However, when it comes to their proper usage of words, we often make the most prominent mistake.For example,We often say thatWe have come from office or school. (Wrong)The correct form should beWe have returned from office or school (right)The basic different which lies between ‚Äúcome‚Äù and return‚Äù:-We use the word ‚Äúreturn‚Äù where we had already gone to a place and that we are returning from there.While on the other hand, the word ‚Äúcome‚Äù is used when none such an action takes place.For example, we can sayMy friend will come to house on my birthday (correct)Here, if we use the word ‚Äúreturn‚Äù for them, then it is going to be wrongLikeMy friend will return to my house on birthday. (Wrong)Hope, you have got the basic difference from the two words ‚Äúcome‚Äù and ‚Äúreturn‚ÄùRead : How do toppers study and how do I need to studyLet‚Äôs take a look at the other mistakes which we often tend to do.We often compliment something or the other if we felt good. However, rarely do we use the most importance word during such times,For example, we shouldn‚Äôt say thatThe food is good (wrong)The food is tasty, sumptuous, mouthwatering or delicious (You can use any one amongst these four for food)We shouldn‚Äôt sayThe match was good (wrong)The correct form isThe match was interesting, electrifying etc.Read : How to get bank Jobs fast after 12th and Graduation in Govt or Pvt sectorSimilarly, if we want to compliment any girl, we use ‚Äúbeautiful‚Äù while for boys we use ‚Äúhandsome‚Äù.These are some of small things which matters a lot in the long run.Apart from these, one of the other things which you need to start preparing yourself is about Active and Passive VoiceIn the world of blogging, there are so many cases when we do not know the proper way to say a thing. In such cases we can make the use of Passive voice.For exampleThe lion killed the dear (Active Voice)The dear is killed by the lion (Passive Voice)As a blogger cum writer, if you are told to re-write a certain paragraph, then you can easily make the best use of this knowledge.My experienceOne of my other experiences which I am sharing in the post relates to the time when I was in class 3rd. I still remember that the teacher asked me about my hobbies and I said ‚ÄúComputer‚Äù. She corrected me by saying that it should be‚ÄúI love playing on computer‚Äùor‚ÄúI love working on computer‚ÄùSimilarly, those who love music, when being asked about their hobbies, they should say that they ‚Äúlove listening music‚Äù.Same goes with other hobbies as well.I am going to further furnish more knowledgeable posts, which will make your journey of writing as well as speaking English easy like never before.In all the earlier posts, I have been trying my level best to tell you intricacies as well in order to help you further.Grammar is regarded to be the backbone without which you possibly can‚Äôt polish the English skills. Hence, make sure that you are well versed with the tenses.English is all about learning the intricacies. One of the most common mistakes which people commit while making the use of ‚Äúolder‚Äù and ‚Äúelder‚ÄùBoth the term means that you are younger to the other person. However, both of them are used in different ways. For example,He is older to me (correct)My brother is older to me (Wrong)Now, I am explaining to you.We use ‚Äúelder‚Äù with those people who have blood relations with us. While for others we use ‚Äúolder‚ÄùI am going to give you another example in order to help you understand in a better way.I am elder to my cousin brother. (correct)My friend‚Äôs father is older to him. (correct)Hope, you have got the difference between the two.Another most common mistake which people mistake pertaining to 12o‚Äô clockIf it‚Äôs day time, then we will be saying, It‚Äôs 12 noon and if its 12 at night, then it‚Äôs 12 midnight.One simply cannot say 12 am o..."
738,"Yeah, generally they do!But it also depends upon a lot of factors.With growing age these things lose their importance and appears to be absurd.Having crush on your teacher nowhere means that you have forgotten all your moral values or else your teacher is too sexy in his looks. When I was in school, there were 18 girls in my class and out of them 15 had a crush on the same english teacher. I was one of them :p And the reason behind it was his chemistry with all the students, his way of dealing the situations, the depth to which he taught us the literature part was epic!

739,"No, if you can get in you probably have what it takes intellectually and, honestly, a few extra years of life experience probably helps as well with maturity, communicating with patients and colleagues, etc.The major issue with starting at an older age is the increased responsibilities that tend to come along with it (e.g., spouse, children, mortgage, etc.) and time and stress management. Med school is pretty intense and residency is more intense so that‚Äôs 7 to 11+ years (depending on specialty and if you do a fellowship) of heavy studying, long hours and low pay.It becomes your life. You have to love it.I started an MD/PhD program at 25 (finished at 32) and then did a 3 year postdoc (age 35) and then matched in neurosurgery (additional 7 years). I left residency to launch my oncology startup but otherwise I would have finished this year at age 42.In my med school class there were maybe 10% who didn‚Äôt come straight from undergrad and 1 who was in her 40s (single, no kids). There were also a handful of married students and they formed a support group along with their spouses. All of them are now practicing.I still think regardless of age the 3 most important things that determine success in med school/residency/practice are 1) location (don‚Äôt move to a city you hate or can‚Äôt afford, being close to family/friends helps too), 2) cost of tuition (I wouldn‚Äôt pay extra for ivy league or private school if you plan on being a private primary care doc), and 3) the people you surround yourself with (maintaining friendships/hobbies, supportive spouse, study groups, support groups, having positive clinical mentors).Good luck!"

744,"Grey matter is neurons, the cell bodies, and very few axons. White matter is the opposite with mostly myelinated axons. You can‚Äôt grow new neurons, you were born with nearly all the neurons you will ever have. Only a small number are produced in specific sites like the Hippocampus.So, grey matter can only decrease? nooooot exactly. The cell bodies are only a part of grey matter. Increases in dendrite branching (the receiving end of neurons) can increase grey matter, without needing new neurons. Existing neurons making more connection would technically also result in more grey matter. Then again, more water in the area would also show up as an increase, but let‚Äôs assume researchers took this error into account.In this study they found Enhanced functional connectivity and increased gray matter volume of insula related to action video game playing. Video games improve your brain? yeah, but not just video games, any repetitive, skill-based tasks (sports, painting, and driving) will do. These activities will make new connections as you practice, leading not only to better connectivity but also increases in grey matter. So go out and do something, practice, do sports, enjoy a hobby, use that brain and don‚Äôt worry about it. If you are asking for a specific skill (e.g. you want to do math better) then practice that skill. The brain changes as you get better, you don‚Äôt get better by changing your brain.Do note, this isn‚Äôt permanent. These type of changes are part of the plasticity of our brain. If you stop using it the connection will weaken and your grey matter will shrink to its original state."

751,"Computers use a variety of data storage methods depending on use case. These are usually tiered, meaning you have large, bulk storage like hard drives for permanent storage all the way up to RAM which is used for temporary storage of data while the program is running.Computer RAM (DRAM) is composed of billions of tiny cells which store individual bits. Each one of these cells is composed of a capacitor (which stores an electrical charge) and a transistor which has control over the capacitor (controls the flow of charge in and out). When the data is needed, the transistor opens and lets the charge stored within the capacitor flow out into a buffer, where it is then read by the computer.Flash storage is a tier below that. Unlike DRAM, it is non-volatile, meaning data is retained after power is cut. I am not in any way qualified to talk about how flash memory works in detail with any amount of certainty, but essentially they rely on quantum effects to ‚Äútrap‚Äù charges within special transistors.And even under that, you have mechanical hard drives. Hard drives are composed of metal platters which are spun around at several thousand rpm. Each one of these platters is plated with trillions of tiny magnets, which are polarized by a read/write head to represent data bits. This is relatively slow as you now have moving parts : the head needs to wait for data to come to it. Because of their nature, these drives are also exceptionally prone to damage from drops and data loss due to magnetic field exposure.And even below that you have magnetic tape. Tape is seldom used in the consumer market, but is alive and well in enterprise sectors. It has exceptional data density (current lt08 tapes can store up to 30TB of compressed data, and we've already seen prototypes from the like of sony that can reach 185TB). They are also cheap (you can buy enterprise grade lt08 tapes for less than 200$). However, they are exceptionally slow, even when compared to hard drives, as tapes have to rewind and fast forward just like old school VHS tapes to access data."

754,"This question has been answered literally 10s of thousands of times on Quora, but I‚Äôll give my opinion since this was an A2A.No matter the route you take, it doesn‚Äôt really matter as long as you practice a shit ton. Look through the popular languages and decide which one you want to start with. I‚Äôd go with one of the following: Java, Swift, Python, C, C++, smalltalk, PHP. It doesn‚Äôt matter that much, and before you get a job doing it you‚Äôll probably want to have bounced around a little bit.Instead of giving step by step instructions, I‚Äôm going to give you a few pointers. Please pay attention to these, don‚Äôt just be like ‚Äúyeah whatever.‚Äù Following these tips will make you grow way faster, and if you actually follow these tips completely, you‚Äôll probably be the fastest learning programmer in history. Nobody follows these rules until way later than they should have, and everyone regrets it a bit. It‚Äôs not a huge deal because everyone does it, but you can seriously make a huge difference. You could be job-ready in 3 months easy if you practice every day and do this stuff. If you don‚Äôt, I‚Äôd say you‚Äôre probably looking at about 1‚Äì3 years of practice at least before anyone hires you.So without further ado, and in somewhat of a loose order of most to least important, my guide to learning how to program:Practice way more than you study/read. Don‚Äôt just read how to do things, try them. You‚Äôll find that most of the time, there‚Äôs complexities that aren‚Äôt mentioned in the text, and you‚Äôll learn way more. Just because you think you know how to make a class in C++ doesn‚Äôt mean you even know how to get the code to compile. This is by far the most important point.Don‚Äôt learn a programming language, learn to program. Sure, you‚Äôll use a programming language and get proficient with it, but it‚Äôs just a tool. If you pick up a book from start to finish on a language, you‚Äôll have learned so much stuff you are never going to use. If you insist on using a textbook, use one that emphasizes examples, or teaches you a programming practice like web development or machine learning. Most programming language focused textbooks aren‚Äôt good as anything but a reference. Furthermore, it‚Äôs really important not to be tied to any one language, especially as a beginner. There‚Äôs a ton of great material out there that is taught in a certain language, but is universally important. You should be able to learn from examples that are written in a language you‚Äôve never used.Try random stuff. Try new frameworks, packages, languages, ideas, etc. just to see how they work. Never made an app? Try it. Never used a front end JS framework? Try it. Buy an arduino. Get a book on object oriented design. Try using a NoSQL database for your next project, or try using a hosted database on AWS.Don‚Äôt take days off. Taking time off takes you ‚Äòout of the zone.‚Äô You want these problems in the back of your mind at all times. Taking days off forces you to get back in the zone, and remember things. I come up with solutions to problems or cool ideas all the time, whether I‚Äôm driving home from work or at the gym.Make programming a hobby. Learn to enjoy it. This comes with straying away from reading textbooks, and practicing more. Make cool shit. Get experience. Don‚Äôt say ‚ÄúI heard that‚Äôs a bad idea.‚Äù Say ‚Äúthat‚Äôs a bad idea, this is what happened to me when I tried that.‚Äù Nobody gives a shit about what you read in a textbook, I promise. Well at least not nearly as much as they care about what you experienced firsthand.Finish projects 100%. Don‚Äôt say ‚Äòeh it‚Äôs pretty much done.‚Äô and move on. Finish it. Publish it. Tell your parents and friends to use it. You‚Äôll never know how much work was actually left. The very end of a project can introduce massive holes in your code. Even moreso, once you‚Äôve launched it, your users will find plenty more. Get it published and get people using it.Network. Quora has introduced me to a lot of cool programmers that have tons of knowledge to give me. I‚Äôve also worked with some kickass engineers/developers that gave me a ton of priceless knowledge. Work in a team as much as possible, it will teach you how companies do things at scale. Version control, task management, code documentation, code readability, loose coupling of objects, etc. are all way more important when working on projects with others.Read tech blogs and info sites. Quora is a great one. Techcrunch, Techmeme, Medium, Stackoverflow, Linkedin, and facebook are the ones I use the most. My newsfeeds on all of those are filled with the newest info on the tech industry.If people read this I‚Äôll edit it as I think of more."

760,"If you‚Äôre considering learning a new language (or refreshing an old one) as I am for my New Year's resolution this year, you should check out Duolingo, the free app/site used by over 110 million people and winner of Apple, Google and TechCrunch awards. You can choose from over 15 languages including Spanish, French, Portuguese, Italian, German, Turkish, and Russian. It‚Äôs available on the web (www.duolingo.com), Android, iOS, and Windows Phone.DISCLAIMER: I had such a good experience with Duolingo that I recently applied to work there (and somehow convinced them to take me!).Here‚Äôs why I think Duolingo helped me stick with my New Year‚Äôs resolution:Its bite-sized lessons prevent burnout. You can use the app anywhere and anytime,and I‚Äôve snuck in many sessions while waiting in lines or during down time (though I also stumbled upon two effective learning times: during my morning commute to work and right before I go to bed).It is designed to feel like a game to keep you motivated. As you get better, you level up to unlock new classes, compete with friends and buy entertaining skill lessons (like ‚Äòflirting‚Äô) with virtual currency.It might also help to know that Duolingo is 100% free, and totally legit: it was previously chosen by Apple as iPhone App of the Year and by Google as Best of the Best for Android, and it happens to be the world‚Äôs most popular learning app with over 110 million users!Why did I start using Duolingo in the first place? My decision to even use Duolingo in the first place comes from a broader realization I had a few years ago. As someone who used to chronically set lofty goals and chronically abandon them (as my dusty, barely-touched saxophone can testify to), it finally clicked that I was setting goals that were overly-ambitious and difficult to measure. Rewriting my goal of ‚Äògetting fit‚Äô to ‚Äòbe able to do 100 pushups in one day by the end of the year‚Äô was the difference between failing and succeeding for me.Note: if you have Mark Zuckerberg-esque abilities to conquer outrageously ambitious resolutions, ignore everything I‚Äôve just said!As a result, this year, I rewrote my previously unsuccessful resolution of 'learning a new language' to 'complete the Duolingo Spanish course in one year with ten minutes of practice everyday.' It worked.And for 2016?Now that this year went reasonably well, I feel pretty comfortable setting two language-related New Year's resolutions for 2016: i) read 4 Spanish novels (>200 pages) and watch 3 Spanish TV shows (any genre), and ii) finish the Esperanto course on Duolingo with 10 minutes of practice everyday.Oh, and my non-language learning New Year‚Äôs resolution is to start being on time for everything. I suck at that.Good luck and happy learning :)"

762,"Many people have one or more types of trees on their property. Trees provide shade and complement landscaping nicely, but they can also cause major disputes when they fall over. A tree may fall over if it is not properly maintained and diseased, or it may fall over during a storm. When a tree falls over onto a neighbor's property, a homeowner is often left to wonder if he or she is liable. Most people assume that they are liable since it is their tree. However, this is not always true.When a tree falls over onto a neighbor's property, that neighbor should submit a claim to his or her insurance company immediately. The insurance company is usually responsible for taking care of the damages. This is true if the tree fell over due to an act of nature. For example, a healthy tree that falls over during a tornado, hurricane, wind storm or winter storm would not be the responsibility of the homeowner. Since the homeowner living on the property where the fallen tree was rooted did not intentionally push the tree over, nature is responsible. This means that the neighbor's insurance policy should cover it under perils.However, there are some cases where a homeowner could be held liable. If the tree fell on the neighbor's home when the homeowner was trying to cut down the tree without professional help, the damage would be the homeowner's responsibility. Also, if the tree was dying, unstable or diseased and the homeowner knew about it, he or she could be liable if it falls over on its own. He or she could also be liable if it falls over during a very light storm that would not normally knock over a tree. When homeowners know they have dying, diseased or unstable trees, it is their responsibility to take steps to prevent them from causing severe damage.In the event a homeowner is liable for the damages, his or her personal insurance company will have to pay the damages. The insurer will have to also investigate the claim and defend the homeowner if he or she is sued by the neighbor whose property the tree fell on. If the homeowner being sued loses, his or her insurer will pay up to the policy limit for damages. For any further damages beyond that, the homeowner is financially responsible. Neighbors can also submit liability claims against homeowner policies.Most cases involve trees falling over due to storms or acts of nature, so many homeowners whose trees fall over do not have to worry about their insurers footing the bill. Also, they do not have to worry about premium increases if they are not found liable for the damages. In some cases, neighbors may still try to sue to recover their deductibles. The best way to avoid this scenario is to prevent it in the first place. Homeowners should check their trees regularly and have them inspected at the first sign of disease or any health issues.A professional arborist can analyze the tree to see if it needs any special treatments, pruning or complete removal. This may seem like an unnecessary expense, but it is much less expensive than the potential cost of paying for a neighbor's home being destroyed and the legal costs that ensue. For those who plan to stay in their homes for any length of time, it is best to try to keep peace with neighbors, so this is also a good way to prevent quarrels or ongoing problems. To learn more about damage claims from fallen trees, discuss concerns with an agent.Source: Who is Liable When a Tree Falls on a Neighbor\'s PropertyRelated Post: save money buying a home in saint paul"
763,"A brief history from the perspective of ‚ÄúBonhoeffer‚ÄùGermany‚Äôs involvement in The Great War, and the loss of that war, resulted in harsh war penalties known as The Treaty of Versailles. This same treaty took away German colonies, massively reduced Germany‚Äôs standing army to 100,000 men, and charged Germany with starting the war, requiring massive war repayments.These war repayments were finally payed off in 2010- 92 years after Germany‚Äôs defeat! (Germany to Settle WWI Debt After 92 Years). This bankrupted the country in the early 1920s, leading to an economic depression and mistrust between the German people and the German government, allowing the rise to power of Adolf Hitler and the Nazi Party.Hitler, in stark contrast from what we see of him today, was seen as a ‚Äúsavior‚Äù of Germany, someone who could make the nation proud once again, and as someone who would punish those responsible for the mistreatment of Germany after World War I- namely, the German government, the Jews, and the Communists.Hitler was, essentially, a madman- but he knew how to gain influence and maintain power. He would lie to the German people, make promises he had no intention of keeping, and ultimately plunge Germany into a second World War, starting with the invasion of Poland on September 1st, 1939.It is important to note that Germany briefly tried a new form of government, called the Weimar Republic from 1919 until 1933, but this ultimately did not last. The German people wanted a strong leader, as the Kaiser had led during World War 1. Adolf Hitler proved to be a strong leader who made promises to restore Germany‚Äôs economic prosperity and position of power in the world, while also ‚Äúrighting the wrongs‚Äù caused during WW1.These lists of grievances, combined with the political genius, rise to power and ruthless tyranny of Adolf Hitler, ultimately resulted in Germany‚Äôs part in starting the deadliest conflict in human history- World War 2."
764,"Interestingly, there‚Äôs another very creative way to find the limit without L‚ÄôHospital, or any expansion of ùëí.e. \hspace{5em} {\boxed{\displaystyle{ f(x) = \sum \limits_{n=0}^{\infty} \frac{x^n}{n!} f^n(0) = f(0) + x f'(0) + \frac{x^2}{2!}f''(0) + \dots }}}\blacksquareTo get started, first understand our purpose.Let  \displaystyle { f(x) = {e^x - 1 -x } }We‚Äôve to find:  \hspace{5em} \displaystyle {\lim \limits_{x \rightarrow 0} \frac{f(x)}{x^2}}One way is to create a replica of the function and use it instead of the given function. But, this requires the knowledge of derivatives.First, understand how it works,Suppose, A and B are 2 cars. They are traveling. Let  p(t) be a function of Car A which returns the Position of the x-axis of the car at the time t. Similarly, for car B, let‚Äôs say it  q(t) . Now, we want both cars to have the same position every time, or Mathematically,  p(t) = q(t).In Mathematical Terms, we want to create a replica of p(t) as q(t). So, for that.Let  q(x) = a + bx + cx^2 + dx^3 \dotsAt time = 0 sec, both cars should have the same position?Or  \displaystyle {\hspace{5em} p(0) = q(0) = a}The velocity of each car should be the same.We‚Äôve position functions. The derivative of position is velocity. So, velocity should be equal.Or  \displaystyle{ \hspace{5em} p'(t) = q'(t) = b + 2cx + 3dx^2 \dots}Now, we‚Äôve got an expression for velocity, As we know, the velocity at t=0 should be same.Or \displaystyle{ \hspace{5em} p'(0) = q'(0) = b}Now, they should have equal rate of change of velocity (derivative) or aka acceleration. At time. t=0Or  \displaystyle{ \hspace{5em} p''(0) =  q''(0) = 2c}Now, they have the same acceleration at the start, if the rate of change of acceleration becomes equal for both cars, then they ‚Äôd have the same position throughout.Like this, if we keep finding the Rate of change of rate of change again and again, then we‚Äôd definitely get function  q(t) as an exact duplicate.Now, keeping this in mind, If the rate of change of 2 functions are equal, and again the rate of change of rate of change becomes equal and similarly this keeps going ‚Ä¶ Then, we get an exact duplicate of functions in form of algebra in infinite series.This is how infinite series is done.For example: \displaystyle{\hspace{5em} f(x) = x - \frac{x^3}{3!} + \frac{x^5}{5!}\dots}Here \sin x and f(x) have the same starting point, 0, the same rate of change, and the rate of change of rate of change are equal and rate of change of rate of change of rate of change is same ‚Ä¶ infinity So, no matter which version of sine function you use you‚Äôd always get the same result because the graph of both functions is exactly the same!Now, we‚Äôll do the exact same thing for f(x) and will create a duplicate for that function and use that to find the limit of the given expression in seconds!Let us call  g(x) = a + bx + cx^2 + dx^3 + ex^4 + \dots \infty \space terms f(x) = e^x -1 - xNow,\displaystyle { \hspace{5em} e^x - 1 - x = a + bx + cx^2 + dx^3 + ex^4 \\ putting \space x=0 \space a =0 \\ \frac{d}{dx} e^x - 1 - x = b + 2cx + 3dx^2 + 4ex^3 \\ e^x - 1 = b + 2cx + 3dx^2 + 4ex^3 \dots \\ putting  \space x=0 \\ 0 = b \\\frac{d}{dx} (e^x - 1)= e^x = 2c + 3.2dx + 4.3ex^2 \dots \\ putting \space x = 0 \\ 1 = 2c \\ c = \frac 1 2 \\ \frac{d}{dx}e^x = 3.2d + 4.3.2. e^x \dots \\ putting \space x = 0 \\ 1 = 3.2d \\ d = \frac{1}{3!} \\ \frac{d}{dx}e^x = 4.3.2.e \dots \\ putting \space x=0 \\ e = \frac{1}{4!}}Thus, putting the values of coefficients, we get an expression! e^x - 1 - x = 0 + 0.x + \frac{1}{2}x^2 + \frac{1}{3!}x^3 + \frac{1}{4!}x^4 \dotsLet‚Äôs see Timelapse see How our graph was made :)Our graph  f(x) = e^x -x -1Red - f(x), black one:- which we created!This is our f(x) function.Expansion Upto 1 term:Upto 2 terms:Upto 3 terms:Upto 4 termsUpto 5 terms..."

Few may be urgent, others may be important, and few may br routine, demanding your attention, and you mind is busy going from one point to other and wandering here and there. This is a normal phenomenon, till you learn to streamline these thoughts and resolve the issues, one by one.You are correct, that such rush of various thoughts, one after the other so fast, that you believe these are simultaneous, and you want to stop all that.It is not a helpless situation, but you need a help. Right now, i put few suggestions, that will work as first aid.You need some breathing exercise. During normal breathing keep your full attention on breathing. Observe which nostril is breathing in and out. Do not control , just observe. Continue it for few minutes.

766,"Mutual funds? In Detail!! That should be like an answer for 25 marks question.So, assuming that you want to invest in mutual funds and want to know about them before you start investing in them, I would be answering it from an investors point of view and will not go in details about how to set them, wats an AMC, etc. stuffs.Mutual fund, as the name suggests, is a fund, which is owned mutually by all those who put in it. There are 2 main reasons of why mutual funds are formed:1. For a ordinary person, who knows not much about markets, about investing, its very difficult to manage money. He wouldnt know how to track a stock, or how to value it? So, for these people, a simple way is just to give there money to someone else who can manage it properly and help you in growing it. But, you can not give all your life‚Äôs saving just to anyone. What if the person you gave money ran away with it?? Thats why mutual funds are set up, so that you can put your money into funds and they will manage it. Since, Fund is managed by AMC, and AMCs are monitored by trusts, your money is safe. Plus these fund managers are intelligent, a keep track of markets and stuffs, they are very much qualified to manage money.2. Another reason is to take advantage of scale and diversity. Suppose you only have Rs. 2,000 with you, and you want to invest it into a stock, which costs around Rs 4,000? You just cannot buy a half stock, and you dont have enough money to buy a single share. Or you want to diversify your portfolio to reduce market risk, but you cannot buy 10 different stock with your small amount. So what will you do? You put your money into a Fund, similar to you, other people also give their money to the the fund, and now fund will have enough money and it can buy any stock it wants. It can also diversify it across multiple stocks to reduce its risk.So thats the main purpose of why funds are formed. Next comes is how are they operated?So, while setting up a fund, the fund manager decides that it wants a total of, for example, Rs 1 crore (total corpus also known as AUM). So, what the AMC will do is, divide Rs. 1 crore in to small parts of Rs. 50 each, so 2lakhs parts in total. Now this Rs. 50 will be the initial NAV of the Fund, at which you or any other person can just buy the units from the AMC. So, if you have Rs. 2000, you will get 40 units. The AMC will then you all the money collected and invest it. As it invests by buying stock, bonds, etc the value of total Rs 1 crore will change, depend upon the current value of all the shares, bonds purchased. So suppose, the current value totals to Rs1.2 crore. Since there were 2lakhs ubits, the NAV will now be Rs1.2 crore divided by 2 lakh units, i.e. Rs. 60. that means the Rs.2000 you invested at Rs. 50 has now become Rs 60 and your total investment is Rs2400. Similar would be the effect if the value of total corpus fall.So, this is what a mutual fund is.If you want to know any specific or anything more, then message me or reply to this."
767,"That depends on whether you are referring to rotation per unit distance or unit time. I suspect you intended per unit time, in which case the answer is yes. The rifling imparts a given amount of spin per unit distance; but the greater the billet speed, then the faster that distance is traversed. Let‚Äôs take a hypothetical 1 turn in 7 inches. If bullet A is accelerated to 24,000 inches per second (2000fps), it is is completing one rotation every 0.000291666666667 seconds. If bullet B, being pushed by a larger powder charge, is accelerated to 36,000 inches per second (3000fps), it is completing one rotation every 0.000194444444444 seconds. In both cases, they are rotating approximately one turn in seven inches. Note that the slower bullet is taking longer to complete each rotation, and the faster billet is taking a shorter time to complete each rotation. Please also note that these units are all at the muzzle; however, all other factors (bullet weight, for example) being the same, the rotational rate should still favor the faster bullet, all the way to impact, provided that the rifling twist is sufficient to keep both bullets stable through their respective flights. Inadequate spin will introduce too many factors to predict the comparable spin rates at impact."

771,"I have seen many wrong answers in the Internet, so I guess that both the concept of functional programming and some of the misconceptions require clarification.The first thing is that the word ‚Äúfunction‚Äù in ‚Äúfunctional programming‚Äù is meant to refer to functions in mathematical sense (i.e. mappings or associations between input and output). This is extremely easy to get confused with the notion of procedures, because many programming languages and programming language tools conflate these two notions.A procedure (sometimes also called a subroutine) is an encapsulated, possibly parameterized sequence of steps of instructions for achieving a desired goal. For example, here are two procedures for preparing an instant soup:This kind of procedural thinking is common in Computer Science for teaching algorithms.Now in some languages procedures can also return a value. For example, in C there is a procedure clock(), which ‚Äúreturns the number of clock ticks elapsed since the start of the program‚Äù, and a procedure called rand() which returns a different pseudo-random number each time it is called.While the manual calls these procedures ‚Äúfunctions‚Äù, these are not the functions in the sense that is meant in functional programming, i.e. they are not mathematical functions.Having procedures that return values, it is possible to use them to implement functions. For example, the procedure square defined in the following wayint square(int x) { return x * x; }implements a function in mathematical sense: every time this procedure is called with the same argument, it will return the same value. (In languages like C that conflate functions with procedures, such procedures are called ‚Äúpure functions‚Äù).Another common misconception about functional programming is that it is about programming with ‚Äúlambdas‚Äù or ‚Äúclosures‚Äù.‚ÄúLambda‚Äù is a rather obscure name for a concept of anonymous function or (more often) anonymous procedure. ‚ÄúClosure‚Äù is a common name for a function enclosed with some context. Here‚Äôs a common example in JavaScriptfunction make_counter() {  var counter = 0;  return function() {    return ++counter;  };}This is not an example of functional programming (note that ‚Äî like C ‚Äî JavaScript conflates the notions of functions and procedures, and uses the keyword function to refer to a procedure).It generates a procedure which, when executed, gives the number of times it has been executed to that point. It is not a mapping between input and output. It is easy to immediately see that this code is not functional, because it contains the ++ operator, which modifies the value of the counter variable, or ‚Äî as programmers like to say ‚Äî performs a mutation.Which brings us to yet another confusion that is quite common in programming languages, namely ‚Äî conflating the notions of definition, binding and assignment. These three are often expressed using the same operator ‚Äî usually the equality sign. For example, if you see the following Python code:variable = valueyou‚Äôre unable to say whether it is a definition or an assignment. This distinction is crucial in functional programming. A definition introduces new binding (between a name and a value) to current scope. An assignment modifies the value of a variable. There are no assignments in functional programs. A binding creates new scope where a name is associated with a bound value. Python‚Äôs capabilities for creating bindings are actually very limited.The distinction is very plain to see in Scheme. The definition is expressed using the define form, as in(define variable value)The assignment is performed using the set! form:(set! variable new-value)Lastly, bindings are created using forms such as lambda and let, for example(let ((variable some-value))  ;; the binding of `variable` shadows some existing binding here  ;; (if any)  ...);; here `variable` still has its old value (if it had one b..."
772,"Most of the answers on this thread are fairly incomplete, inaccurate or outright boring.Let me explain them in a lucid and fun way.Imagine you‚Äôre a boss of a cotton firm. You produce 1 quintal of cotton every month. You have workers under you. The production cost is necessarily less than selling cost. The boss takes apart aside called profit and distribute the rest to the worker as wages. This is called capitalism.Imagine, if there was no boss and workers get the value of cotton they produce with no scope of profit is socialism.Socialism emerged as a protest against capitalism.[1]Capitalism is based on profit.Socialism is based on need.Capitalism is survival of the fittest.Socialism is focused on the welfare of least advantaged groups.In capitalism, capitalists are exploiters.In socialism, workers are exploiters.In capitalism, the state is controlled by the capitalist.In socialism, the state is controlled by workers.Some additional knowledge about socialism:The word socialism is used quite often in media and political speeches. It was also added to Indian constitution‚Äôs preamble through 42nd amendment. India is also a country which claims to be based on socialist principles but hardly seen post-1991 economic reforms of LPG.[2]Hence, endless varieties seem to emerge. Socialism was called a ‚Äúhat[3]that lost its shape‚Äù by C.E.M. Joad.[4]Socialism stands for:Social and economic equality.Man is social by nature.Society is natural and prior to man.Then Karl Marx came into the picture in the 19th century, he influenced the socialism so much so that socialism began to be called before and after Marx.Marx reiterated that the French revolutionaries like Louis Blanc lack the understanding of capitalism.Hence after Marx, Revisionists, Fabianism, guild socialism and syndicalism followed. All these schools of thought are a subject matter of another answer.Marx is among the few philosophers by whose name a school of thought is established.Karl MarxHe was a materialist.[5] He was also a critique of religion and called it an opium of the masses.[6]Marx was neither the first or the last socialist. He is the most important personality in the evolution of socialism. He called the socialism propounded by others as utopian and called himself scientific.His works can be divided into two broad categories as young and mature Marx where young Marx talks about economic and philosophical manuscripts and the concept of alienation and mature Marx wrote a communist manifesto and Das Kapital.[7]He famously quoted:‚ÄúIn order to make history one has to live; in order to live one has to eat; in order to eat one has to produce. Hence it is for the production that man has formed society‚Äù( and not the other way round)Economic structure is a ‚Äúbase‚Äù of all other structures. Only when the economic structure changes, the superstructure can be changed.Socialism was one of the stages of a transition from capitalism to communism.According to Marx, socialism will come through violent revolution and overthrow of capitalism. This was the transitional stage and communism will follow.In communism, the private property is abolished. Classes will be abolished and class struggle will end.When struggle ends following that dialectics end and following that history ends.Hence, it is said that the communism is the end of history.End of history meant the end of contradiction.In communism, the state shall wither away as the state was an instrument of the propertied class.Communism is a society where people get thing according to their needs.But you may now wonder that Marx might be opposite to industrialisation given he called it an instrument of the bourgeois. Marx supported industrialization and supported mass production by machines to fulfil the need of every person.Marx called communism a state of perfect freedom. Freedom from necessities. Man is free and he does what he wanted to do.Freedom in capitalist society is not free but it is false consciousness which leads to alienation and isolation.Conclusion:Socialism stood as an opposition to Capitalism.Karl Marx influenced socialism like no other and explained the economic structure and dictatorship of bourgeoisie through it. He wanted a revolution. He wanted a violent overthrow of capitalists. Marxism is a school based on Marx's idea which regarded socialism as a transition stage to communism.For Marx, communism is a state of freedom and away from false consciousness.[8]Charles Tips also answered this question beautifully: Charles Tips's answer to What's the difference between Socialism, Marxism and Communism?AFootnotes[1] Karl Marx (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy)[2] 1991: Economic Reforms[3] Socialism is like a hat that has lost its shape because¬† everybody wears i[4] C.E.M.

776,"No one has given you a full answer but Mr. Enright is the closest thus far. People seem to be focused on premium vs. claims; however, this is most definitely NOT how insurance companies make money. Most insurers try to price their policies such that the total premiums collected each year are equal to the total amount of claims paid + expenses (we call this the combined ratio - claims+expenses:premium). A combined ratio of 1 is seen as ideal because it means they are not over or under pricing their policies; meaning that they are underwriting the risks they want as pricing models are designed to attract what a company identifies as their target market. With regard to automobile insurance, most insurers actually run a loss on premiums, normally paying just over a dollar for every dollar of premium (combined ratio >1); whereas, they normally run just under a 1 ratio on property insurance. Ultimately, very little, if any profit is made through underwriting (premiums) alone; rather, the reason for writing policies and collecting premiums is to build an investment pool.¬†When an insurer collects premiums they put that money into an investment pool. They use the premiums collected to fund investments (generally in guaranteed or low risk securities due to regulatory restrictions). When a claim is made money is then taken from that pool and put into a cash account to pay the claim once the adjustment of it is completed. Where insurers make their money is on the interest and return on investment earned from those premium dollars while they are in the investment pool. The ideal is to have enough premium coming in to keep the investment pool fully funded but the profit itself comes from the return on investment rather than a surplus in the premiums charged vs. claims and expenses paid. Let's look at State Farm Mutual for an example.... in 2011 State Farm collected $32,640,000,000 in premiums; they paid $22,794,000,000 in claims, $4,311,000,000 in claims expenses, $7,527,000,000 in administrative/service expenses; resulting in a LOSS of $1,993,000,000 on underwriting; however, they had investment income of $2.,901,000,000. So while they actually lost $1.9 Billion on premiums vs. claims and expenses (combined ratio of 1.06) they made $2.9 Billion on investement income. As you can see, insurers don't make money through premiums but through investment."
777,"It has to be this :Dilwale ( Shah Rukh Khan )Dulhaniya ( Kajol )Le jayenge ( No. Her father let her go ) or else the title would bhi Dilwale Dulhaniya Nahi Leja Payenge.The Story is toooo cliche. It was released in the year 1995 when Hollywood was releasing films like Seven and Toy Story. Sharukh Khan plays the role of the son of a rich industrialist living in London who's friend circle is nothing more than a bunch of hobos. He's father is happy that he failed and thus sends him to a trip in Europe ( I wish my father was like him ). So our hero has nothing to do in a city like London but trouble an old man who runs a grocery shop near a petrol pump. This old man coincidentally happens to be the father of the woman with which our hero is going to fall madly in love. Yes why not? How are the writers going the show the struggle our hero will face to marry her? So the hero and the heroine meet in a train and travel to Switzerland because that's the only place Yash Chopra Films think what Europe looks like. So our hero and heroine obviously fall in love and decide that they're going to be would mates.Undoubtedly, the writers were forced to add a twist in the plot. So that twist is that the heroines father wants her to get married to an Indian guy ( because every Indian father thinks only indian guy's are perfect and pure souls ). No not even Raj, because he's an NRI. He should be pure Indian born and bought up in India with Indian cultural background. But hey, wasn't her daughter raised in London? What if he had a son as well? Would he force her to marry an Indian girl only? Typical Indian father.So he with his family lands in Punjab ( because that's where Yash Chopra is from ) . Raj who's desperate to bang Simran lands in Punjab at an uninvited wedding, at an unknown place, between unknown people and starts giggling around with them.So Simran wants to marry Raj, but Simran's father wants her to get married with the Indian guy, the Indian guy wants to marry Simran ( because she has a British degree ) , Raj wants to bang Simran, Raj's father wants an Indian daughter in law, Simran's mother is skeptical about Raj and Simran's sister's role has ended .After all this melodrama Simran's Father accept and tells her to catch the train and run away with Raj. Because he's the actual hero of the films without whom Raj couldn't do anything but wank.So this is the most overrated and popular Indian film because people still watch the 12‚Äì3 pm show at Maratha Mandir and has completed 550 weeks.Thank You."
778,"I see variants of this question alot so I will try to give a comprehensive and concise answer. It may be a bit lengthy.General Q Learning and Temporal Difference UpdateThe Q learning algorithm (including DQN) utilizes two components.It‚Äôs parametized by a state-action value function (or called the Q function), which is trying to learn to predict the expected accumulated sum of discounted reward until the end of a single trajectory (for example a single run in Atari)We update our parametized Q function towards the optimal Q function via temporal difference updates. This means at each time step, we adjust the parameters (weights in terms of neural networks) a little bit so the Q network prediction matchesMore concretely, the Q function is trying to approximate the expected accumulated sum of discounted rewards:ùëÑ(ùë†ùë°,ùëéùë°)=ùëÖùë°=ùëüùë°+ùõæ‚ãÖùëüùë°+1+ùõæ2‚ãÖùëüùë°+2+ùõæ3‚ãÖùëüùë°+3+‚Ä¶+ùõæ‚ãÖùëüùë°+ùëõQ(st,at)=Rt=rt+Œ≥‚ãÖrt+1+Œ≥2‚ãÖrt+2+Œ≥3‚ãÖrt+3+‚Ä¶+Œ≥‚ãÖrt+nQ(s_t,a_t) = R_t = r_t + \gamma \cdot r_{t+1}+\gamma^2 \cdot r_{t+2} + \gamma^3 \cdot r_{t+3} + \ldots + \gamma^ \cdot r_{t+n}You can start to see that, this is a regression problem, given your paramatized Q function (say a deep Cov net in the case of DQN) and a current state observation ùë†ùë°sts_t and an action to take ùëéùë°ata_t, you try to adjust the weights of this neural network at every step so its predictions are closer towards the sum on the right hand side in equation above.But how do you get this sum in just one step? The equation doesn‚Äôt work because given the current state ùë†ùë°sts_t and action ùëéùë°ata_t , we have to predict the future and know what is the reward at each step all the way until the end. The temporal difference method bypass this by introducing the Q function recursively on the right side as well. More specifically, the above equation is equivalent to the one below:ùëÑ(ùë†ùë°,ùëéùë°)=ùëüùë°+ùõæ‚ãÖùëÑùëöùëéùë•(ùë†ùë°+1,ùëéùë°+1)Q(st,at)=rt+Œ≥‚ãÖQmax(st+1,at+1)Q(s_t, a_t) = r_t + \gamma \cdot Q_{max}(s_{t+1}, a_{t+1})You can see that if you expand the Q term on the right hand side it‚Äôs equivalent to the first equation.This is now interesting, by introducing the recursion, we now can update our Q function at every step instead of waiting until the end to sum up all the reward we received along the way.We finally have an update target to our regression problem. The procedure is simple, at every time step, we observe an initial state ùë†ùë°sts_t, take an action ùëéùë°ata_t, and receive an immediate reward ùëüùë°rtr_t and we arrive at a new state ùë†ùë°+1st+1s_{t+1}. Notice we now have everything we need to plug into the equation above. We adjust the weight of our Q network to minimize the MSE between the left and right hand side.DQNOne more point about paramerizing your DQN. In traditional Q learning you would have a Q network for each potential action. In DQN, they built their network so that it computes Q value for all actions in parallel. This is much more computational efficient. The difference is show below:With regards to DQN, you notice that the Q network is parametized in a way that it take state as input and computes q-values for all ùëõnn actions given the state input. (diagram on the right). the Q network weight update is as follows, at every step:Given ùë†ùë°sts_t , you run that forward through your Q network and outputs ùëõnn linear output units (corresponding to ùëõnn actions).

The epsilon is a value that starts at say 0.99 and gets annealed to a final value of 0.05 as the agent learns)You run your selected action through the environment (make sure you note which action index of ùêºII you selected) , and receive from the environment the immediate reward ùëüùë°rtr_t and subsequent state ùë†ùë°+1st+1s_{t+1} you end up in.You run the subsequent state ùë†ùë°+1st+1s_{t+1} forward through your Q network.

779,"I think it all depends on the intention. How do you intend to use the language? Let us use an analogy of cooking to programming.¬†The daily mealLet us assume you just moved to a new city away from home and haven't made yourself much useful in the kitchen at home so far because usually Mom and occasionaly Dad used to cook for the family. After spending half your travel allowances on food in the new city, You want to be able to satisfy your hunger when the restaurants seem to be an inefficient way of obtaining food in the long term and you decide it is time you learn cooking. The last thing you want to do is pick up a guide to cooking French Cuisine or Sushi. You start with the basics. Learn to identify the ingredients (vegetables, meats, oils, spices, cereals and so on). And you begin cooking in a month's time, very much self dependent. You won't be able to cook like any of those Michelin Star restaurants but you will have decent food in your plate everyday. However, on the plus side, you will learn the most fundamental knowledge.¬†This experience is like programming in C. It is useful for small tasks for specific use cases. But it is nowhere close to cooking anything elaborate. The did make an entire OS out of C (Unix/Linux ) which has been in use for the last 4 decades now but it is an exceptional case. If the original programmers were to write Unix now, C would, in my opinion, not be their first choice). On the other hand, you learn to programme the way a computer sees it. And it works very fast as you skip all the bells and whistles.¬†The street food vendorYou move to a new city. You want to cook food for yourself and you want to run a typical food shack, coking food. You optimize things, you prepare for recipies in advance of your opening times. It takes a bit longer to prepare all your items but when a customers order a plate of noodles, it doesnt take you more then 10 minutes to serve them piping hot noodles. You can manage cooking dozens of items within a few minutes. Once you kept multiple stoves running simultaneously, all cooking different items for you, but then you ended up adding diced chicken into an order of vegan soup and two servings of salt into the same order. So you decided to use the extra stoves only when you had no other option.This is like programming in C++. Writing classes for every little thing is time consuming but when you use them, it is faster to write your functionality into you application. It is more managable and suitable for larger applications then your ad hoc program needs, but you are likely to make mistake that are not easy to fix. Also long term maintainance becomes a hassle.The fast food retail chainYou found a job at a fast food chain. So you have a lot of standard ingredients to use. You dont know how they were made and frankly, you do not care. Many of them are obtained from various factories elsewhere. However, you undestand their proper use. There are a lot of conventions and rules you follow, some written, some learnt from your experiences. It would take you days to prepare the ingredients if youhad to do them yourself. However, you dont have to.. someone else is making them for your chain. You just need to know which ones to mix and match to get what. However, you are able to manage mutiple orders at once. the store is able to deliver hundereds of items every hour.This is where C# is useful. It is useful for enterprise platforms having several million lines of code. It does not drive you mad to manage all of that magnitude. However if you were to write a simple program to show current time on the screen, it would take you a much larger code structure to run the process, build it and execute it¬†SummaryC: suitable for simple tasks but not suitable for a large applicationC++: suitable for medium applications but usually verbose for small tasksC#: suitable for large apps and also suitable for enterprise platforms/applications. Not very useful for one of small tasksImplications for a beginerAlthough from the above discussion it may seem that one must start with C, move on to C++ and finally learn using C# that is not correct. This illustration is not of a journey to learn progrmming. It is an illustration of what the intention of the programmer is with the language. There is nothing wrong with starting with C# directly, however it is a longer, slower but step by step understanding of programming principles if one goes through the entire sequence of learning which has its own benefits."
780,"I've pretty much tried them all: Fitbit's different models, Jawbone UP/UP24, Basis B1 and Peak, Withings, Bodymedia, Nike Fuelband, Misfit Shine, Amiigo and Flyfit to name a few.Apart from the Amiigo which is scary inaccurate considering that it has two datapoints (wrist and ankle) and the Flyfit which I'm not sure about yet, I have to say that the others are accurate enough when it comes to steps. Wearing two different devices will at the end of the day show a discrepancy between the two depending on where you've worn them. Wrist worn devices like Jawbone, Basis and Misfit Shine are worse at tracking movement when you don't move your arms very much (e.g. pushing a stroller, carrying a heavy bag). In general, I tend to find pocket worn devices more accurate when it comes to steps.To be honest, if you want to track your steps, an iPhone 5S or 6 is enough as it has the M8 chip that automagically tracks your activity with very low battery usage. You can use the Health Book app to see your movement data.When it comes to other activity, so far the only tracker that is somewhat good at automatically (without any input from me) detecting that I'm doing something else (running, biking) is the Basis Peak. That's not to say it's good: I think it's a major fail that a tracker that has access to my heart rate cannot predict that I'm exercising when I'm for example boxing which is a repetitive pattern that should be easy to discern (to compare, the Moov which is an activity coach can coach both boxing, running and swimming).As for sleeping, no activity tracker on the market today is accurate, simply because they don't have access to enough data points."
781,"[Originally asked: Is there any archaeological proof that Jesus existed?]YES.There is more archaeological proof for Jesus‚Äô existence than for virtually any other figure from ancient history.There‚Äôs an abundance of corroborating archaeological evidence; a great amount of the people, cities, places, etc. of Jesus‚Äô life and ministry are established in the archaeological record. I‚Äôll summarize a lot of that at the end of this answer.But when it comes to Jesus specifically, the best proof we have is the Bible.Many people will object here. They will deny that the Bible can ever be used as proof of Jesus.But this question doesn‚Äôt get to make that objection. You asked for archaeological evidence of Jesus‚Äô existence, and the Bible fits the bill perfectly.This wasn‚Äôt always the case. Back when the King James Version was first translated from the Greek (roughly 400 years ago in 1611 A.D/C.E.), they had reference to perhaps a dozen Greek manuscripts of the New Testament. None of these were particularly old; they were removed from the time of Jesus by many hundreds, if not a thousand, years.In such a situation, you could imagine all sorts of changes occurring in the text between the time it was first written to the time it was translated.But then came archaeology.In the last 150 years, archaeologists have dug up thousands of ancient biblical manuscripts. Today we have over 10,000 manuscripts of the New Testament in the original languages, stretching back in time to the early 2nd and late 1st centuries.In all of this, there is no evidence of the content changing over time.There are minor scribal issues, of course. There will always be minor copy issues when human agents perform the copying. But given the abundance of manuscripts, we can easily spot and correct these changes.The evidence is so strong that even Bart Ehrman, one of the staunchest skeptics around, agrees. Out of the nearly 8,000 verses in the New Testament, Ehrman might quibble on perhaps a dozen, and none of these affect the teaching or beliefs of Christianity. They‚Äôre all exceedingly minor issues. (For a complete interview with Ehrman on this subject, consult the appendix of Ehrman‚Äôs book Misquoting Jesus, which establishes this information and much more).What does all this have to do with archaeological proof for Jesus?Everything.Consider the impact of these three facts, all of which archaeology has established for the New Testament:It was written during the lifetimes of the eye-witnesses to Jesus.It was published in the lands where the events happened, while tens of thousands of eye-witnesses could put the lie to anything in them that wasn‚Äôt accurate.It was not changed over time; the content of the New Testament today is the same as when it was first written.All this happened during a time when Jesus‚Äô enemies held all the power and tried to destroy Christianity in any way possible. And yet they never charged the Bible with any kind of inaccuracy, nor did they attempt to argue that Jesus didn‚Äôt exist.Robert Van Voorst searched the first few centuries A.D./C.E and concluded clearly:‚Äú‚Ä¶ [N]o pagans and Jews who opposed Christianity denied Jesus‚Äô historicity or even questioned it.‚Äù(Van Voorst, Jesus Outside, p. 15)He elaborates:‚Äú‚Ä¶ [I]f anyone in the ancient world had a reason to dislike the Christian faith, it was the rabbis. To argue successfully that Jesus never existed but was a creation of early Christians would have been the most effective polemic against Christianity ‚Ä¶ [Yet] all Jewish sources treated Jesus as a fully historical person ‚Ä¶ [T]he rabbis ‚Ä¶ used the real events of Jesus‚Äô life against him‚Äù(Van Voorst, Jesus Outside, pp. 133‚Äì134, emphasis added)Jesus‚Äô enemies unintentionally did Him a great service: they corroborated the accounts written about Him. They used the real events of Jesus‚Äô life against Him, which you only do when you cannot deny that those events happ..."

790,"Well, in fact, the best evidence for evolution in the fossil record is all of it. Let me explain.I'll start with the story of a precambrian bunny. The precambrian bunny is a mythical creature. It wandered the earth, nomming on the Ediacaran fauna. Stuff like: Arkarua adamiand Charnia masoni, a tasty little thing that may look like a fern, but in fact lived in water so deep that photosynthesis was not possible. Our bunny was¬† good swimmer.Okay, this is rather absurd. It's perfectly understandable that bunnies could not have lived during this period of time. Of course, if you think about it, why is it that scientists can recognize that different forms of life lived in different periods of time? Why is it, that the further back in time you go, the less life looks like it does today?We can start with geology. Strata are laid down horizontally, and form under a lot of different conditions. Limestone, for instance, is made up of the ""skeletal fragments of organisms"" or ""by the chemical precipitation of calcite or aragonite""Sandstone is made from, well, sand. ""[T]he sand becomes sandstone when it is compacted by pressure of overlying deposits and cemented by the precipitation of minerals within the pore spaces between sand grains.""So, what's the point. Well, the strata that fossils are found within can tell us about the environment in which they lived. And since strata are laid down horizontally, the deeper the stratum the further back in time it was deposited. This, absent any absolute dating techniques can provide a rough, relative age of the fossils.That was geology. Now lets talk Phylogeny. Phylogeny is the study of how species are related to each other. A phylogenic tree is a picture of how life is related. The further away from the branches (which are modern species or dead ends) the further back in time. This is because, necessarily, the descendants of a population must come after it's ancestors.From this we can draw the conclusions that stratigraphy should correlate with phylogeny. In general we should find ancestors lower in the stratigraphic record than we find descendants. This is why a precambrian bunny is so absurd. Bunnies are a recent species, the precambrian ended about 540 million years ago.But putting the bunny aside, we can get back to the general case: the correlation between stratigraphy and phylogeny. Because the fossil record is messy and because biology is messy, this is a necessarily statistical science.This excellent essay discusses this issue, 29+ Evidences for Macroevolution.Here is a quote of a quote within this essay:""... the RCI and SCI metrics showed impressive left-skewing; the majority of cladograms tested show good congruence between cladistic and stratigraphic information. Cladists and stratigraphers may breathe easy: the cladistic method appears, on the whole, to be finding phylogenies that may be close to the true phylogeny of life, and the sequence of fossils in the rocks is not misleading. ... it would be hard to explain why the independent evidence of the stratigraphic occurrence of fossils and the patterns of cladograms should show such striking levels of congruence if the fossil record and the cladistic method were hopelessly misleading."" (Benton and Hitchin 1997, p. 889)So, the end result is this. If evolution is true, then it is necessary that the order that fossils are laid down in the fossil record correlates with how those fossils are related. And when the whole fossil record is examined and measured against this expectation, it fits. In essence, all the fossil evidence supports evolution. How much more evidence would you need than all if it."

797,"First, be clear why you want to increase your reading. If it is because of a vague feeling that you ""should"" be reading because everyone says so, my advice would be to just throw the should out and go and do what makes you happy. However, if you really want to read for yourself, I would probe into why you want that. Examples.1. Keep up with the state of the art in your field. If this is the objective, then spend an hour planning exactly what you need to keep up to speed on, and figure out the most efficient way. It might well not involve reading at all, or just reading small pieces such as blog posts. That is fine. What matters is that you got the job done with the least amount of effort possible. I would call that a win. The key is to have some sort of a roadmap or outline in advance that will guide you of what you need to master, and how well you need to master it. 2. You need to improve your ability to absorb and assimilate lots of written material because of your job, or requirements as a researcher etc. If this is the case, practice is the best way to go, and don't set yourself up for disappointment by expecting it to be a ton of fun, at least initially. Instead, start with a small goal of an easy to understand technical book similar to what you will be required to read and understand. Set a small target, say reading the book with focus for 10 minutes everyday. The key here is to make yourself a more active participant by taking notes, an outline, creating a mind map or otherwise generally engaging with the material as if you were required to teach it to a class the next day. Over time you will become really good and might even start to enjoy it3. Acquire a classical education. This translates into reading what used to be called the great books, and generally heavy but not technical material. In my view, this is the hardest and yet most rewarding type of reading. A good rule is to start with an engaging commentary on a classic, for example, any of Mortimer Adler's books. Again, the key is to engage start small, and read with an open yet inquiring mind. I have found in these cases that trying to summarize in my own words briefly what the writer is trying to say improves my understanding by orders of magnitude. Slower, no doubt, but richly rewarding, provided you pick the right books.4. Read¬† lighter nonfiction to keep up with friends etc. As an example, popular history, current affairs, popular science etc. Jared Diamond's books would be a good example of this genre. The outline and question technique I mentioned above will work very well here. However, the trade off is the time you spend versus the return you get. In general,unless you have a deep and abiding interest in the subject, my experience is that it is not worth my time to take that level of effort. I also don't feel compelled to finish the book from start to the last page. Again comes down to what you hope to accomplish by reading the book. I am assuming that pure pleasure is not the main reason because if it were, you would not have asked the question. If you just want to be able to follow the conversation of intelligent peers, then a glance at the main chapter heads, the foreword or introduction should give you a rough grasp of what you need to read to meet your goals. If it turns out to be gripping you can always go back to the beginning and finish it. The important thing is to not let the reading become a silent tyrant over you, draining your energy. You get to decide what makes the most sense to do for that book, given your objective.5. Read fiction for enjoyment. If this is your goal, try to pick up something really light that appeals to your natural interests. Keep trying different genres until you find something that clicks.please do not start with War and Peace. Then when the pleasure you get from reading a well crafted story exceeds whatever challenge you have currently in reading, then slowly go into more challenging areas. Taking a literature appreciation class in a really good school will help you get ""infected"" with the teacher's enthusiasm. In addition, there are great videos and online courses that in many cases are available for free that cover great literature. Dip your toe in gently to see if it works.6. If all else fails¬† and you are still desperate, gamify. Set your target, and set yourself a reward that you truly want, and give yourself that reward upon meeting that target. For example, you can buy yourself something you have been wanti if you finish War and Peace from start to finish.Hope this helps. Happy reading!"

Furthermore, the programs were associated with high costs, attrition rates, and probability of regaining at least 50% of the lost weight in 1 to 2 years...Bariatric surgery generally is effective for sustained weight loss of about 16% for people with BMIs of at least 40 kg/m(2) or at least 35 kg/m(2) with comorbid conditions"" Bariatric surgery: an evidence-based analysis. Even surgery is not enough to look like a magazine model (even with airbrushing). For those of us with a calculator, a five foot woman who weighs 200 pounds has a BMI high enough for surgery. That surgery will result in about 16% of her weight lost, or 32 pounds. She will still likely weigh 168 after having surgery done. For a 6 foot man, he'd need to weigh 300 pounds to qualify for surgery. After surgery, he'd get a 48 pound weight loss, and still weigh 252 pounds. (BTW, his resting caloric burning at 300 pounds was 3279 calories a day. So eating 2000 calories would be starving for him.) NutritionData BMI & Calories Burned CalculatorIn frustration, many people drop their caloric intake to below what they need to function minimally. In many parts of the world they have another word for this diet, it's called starvation. And starvation does work, but only short term. This Just In:¬† Starving Yourself Leads to Greater Weight Loss Than Just Dieting. As soon as you stop starving your body will rebound hard, storing more fat in preparation for what it can only assume is a crop shortage.Remember Rubenesque?The reality is that our bodies do not respond to calories. We respond to caloric trends with hormonal adaptions. Certain food and lifestyle choices set you up to succeed or fail calorically (and these goals change based on societal norms - remember the Rubenesque female?). Weight Gain: The Connection Between The Sugars You Eat and the Hormones You Produce. Starvation alters the levels of thyroid hormone dramatically long before your body starts depleting your fat stores. So the only way to change your body is very slowly and sustainably, with changes you can maintain for the rest of your life. Just when you thought you'd got a handle on hormones and weight loss, it turns out that when you give a germ free mouse a fecal transplant from an obese mouse, the germ free mouse will gain 57% more weight while eating the same calories. How Are We To Lose Weight If Diet And Exercise Are Not Enough?For simplicity's sake, at this point certain long term dietary choices can improve your microbiome and lead to more sustainable weight loss.

If it goes the wrong way, eventually your episode will be forgotten and it could be a funny story to tell at dinner parties.The Con: Not sure how it is in your state, but in New York there is somewhat of a ‚Äúblack list‚Äù for renters who have sued their landlords. Even if the landlord is in the wrong and you are in the right. I would check to see if this goes on a permanent record.

805,"I have got overall 7.5 bands in IELTS Academic, so my suggestions are based on that level.I am also assuming you know tenses and other grammatical stuff ( I have less problems in this area . It is natural for me . :-))If you want 7.5 bands prepare for 8.Get a practice partner for speaking preparation.Get a reference material. e.g. makkar ielts . It is paid but you can find pdf online for free just by googling it. Make sure that you are reading latest version.Reference material will help you to give reply spontaneously. It will prepare your mind and will compensate for imagination in most part(although you can't answer as per reference line by line, examiner will certainly notice it . Say bye bye to your 8 or 7.5 in speaking if you do this).Don't mug up reference materials, improvise and make it yours.Use Cambridge and IDP materials for reading and listening , can be found on internet for free also. Writing and speaking part may be outdated.Also print your material if possible . I do not suggest digital reading like quora.Take Writing task seriously. It dragged me down to 7.5 .I had to wrap up my graph in 10 minutes. Yes, write essay first and finish it with in 35 to 37 minutes.15 to 17 minutes for graph or table (section 1 ).Use remaining time to check for grammatical and spelling errors. (FYI I was out of time to do this part).Essay book was provided by classes to me and it was makkar, I was not able to find it online . For graph simons is avaliable.Use gerund , passive and connective words.And for listening , practice and patience are necessary.Try to not waste time by applying more than necessary logic. You might also miss answer of following question by thinking about current question ( It happens in mostly MCQ based question to be precise.)Try to train yourself to be alert till last section. Most people tend to relax a bit unconsciously here.Good command on listening and reading are important and essential to improve overall bands.If you have good short-term memory than you have conquered the reading fort.While practicing, I used to finish easy reading within 45 minutes and some real hard from IDP took more than 60 minutes . In my exam I finished reading in 57 minutes. Difficulty level was moderate but it was really long.Remember while practicing you might write T and F. But in exam write TRUE and False, not the short terms.Also write your answers in separate sheet not besides question , if you're using hard copy. Use pencil.I have not mentioned some basic instructions. Do comment if you need in Depth instructions.Thanks for all the upvotes, It really means a lot. I have added few points which also has impact on the result. I did not add this initially because below suggestion might do more harm than good If you do not have enough exposure to cruel world awaiting outside of your comfy homeSo, even after my clich√© warning you want to read it, go for it because I still believe in humanity :-).Environment around you is important.If you have joined classes for IELTS , You will find people who are in same boat as you. (At least in India there are small companies who professionally help you to prepare for exam.)This people in classes might become your friends (Rivals) that may boost your moral. You might think you don‚Äôt need this kind of motivation, but believe me sky is the limit when it comes to language. This people are important. For instance, some might be trying to go in same country as you, so in short if everything goes smooth you have at least one more familiar face in an unknown country.These friends are very important ,because they can spot your mistakes easily compared to those who are not preparing for IELTS.In classes there are some people who have already given the exam once, you can talk with them and learn about their mistakes.Most people are good but If I were you, I‚Äôd take their advice with a pinch of salt (Remember rivalry is not healthy every time).The professional instructors do spot some mistakes that average joe like me can‚Äôt identify, simply because I‚Äôm not aware that they are mistakes.It is your life . If i were in your shoes, I wouldn‚Äôt take any chance with it to just save few bucks.Don‚Äôt be a moron and spend large amount on classes that focus on worthless things. You should be able to distinguish the thin line between adequate and exorbitant.It is even better if you have school or college friends preparing with you, because you will be comfortable around them.Some people are afraid to speak in front of crowd(In classes) because they have low self-confidence.So, your friends can help you to boost that confidence a little.I kind of feel I‚Äôm repeating my self but still be careful with your friends. Even if one of you is casual (or in pretty words has lack of seriousness) you are better going solo for preparation.You are not going to fight a war, so chill a little. Do remember your future might depend on it.(I know this is out of place here. Respect everyone who has sacrificed their present to make your future. Soldiers on border stay strong, you always have our unconditional love and respect.)You might learn a new prospective on a topic from them. You will understand the importance of prospective when you start your preparation.Do comment if you have any doubts or suggestions. All the best for your exam. Happy Journey..!!Don‚Äôt stress your mind before exam. Only practice maximum 2 full LSRW .On the exam day I didn‚Äôt do anything new, just went through my notes for 10 to 15 minutes. You might feel hungry during exam so eat something before leaving home.I know it‚Äôs silly to write this, ‚Äòuse washroom before you enter exam hall and wear nice clothes(must be comfortable as well ) because they will take a photograph of you before exam which will be there in your IELTS certificate‚Äô .Some of you messaged me that you are facing difficulties in writing task. I am not great at writing as well. At that time I had made 3 to 4 different types of generalize formats . For eg. if the topic is about impact of something after it was discovered you can use something like ‚ÄòSince the advent of internet‚Ä¶.‚Äô. So I had this type of 4 to 5 sentence which I can use in 1st paragraph and last paragraph each. I have jot it down in a book but I don‚Äôt remember where it is.( I wish I had documented it properly.)Also don‚Äôt read old essay too much. It is waste of time.

806,She‚Äôs in college and I‚Äôm studying. We rarely talk to each other and we meet once a week or every other week. Does she understand I need to study? Does she just not care anymore? How do I know if my long-distance girlfriend of 2 years still loves me?
807,"(Read my edits !!!!!)I‚Äôm probably going to offend some people but oh well, here goes.In 2017, the only ways to ‚Äúguarantee‚Äù a comfy and stable income are obtaining and doing well in a STEM degree, Law, and some business degrees like Finance, Marketing, Economics, and Accounting. The worthless ones you are curious about? Pretty much everything else. You can without a doubt struggle to find work related to your degree, but in the world we live in there is a strong preference for certain fields such as the ones above.I‚Äôm sorry, but if you major in Philosophy or Art History and don‚Äôt have a path to wind up in one of these in-demand fields, I wish you the best of luck to you in life because nobody in industry seems to be wanting the talents that the students in these types of majors present. I would love to be shown otherwise, I really would, but in the age of ‚ÄúBig Data‚Äù people just seem to care about getting the data, interpreting it, and seeing how it will impact business decisions and some legal matters probably too. Yes, without question communication skills and critical thinking skills are important but all of these are very developed in somebody that did well in STEM, business, or law. Every humanities degree will claim they promote ‚Äúcritical thinking‚Äù but outside of their respective domain, these people as a collective whole seem to lack more universal critical thinking. If you want to develop your critical thinking and be able to apply it to everything, not just your restrictive domain, study Mathematics/Statistics or Computer Science/EE where the literal study of logic is a core part of the curriculum (Law could be another good one here). The lab sciences and other engineering degrees are also good at developing this, but logic isn‚Äôt as heavily focused on since it isn‚Äôt as essential (in one sense) to the field than it is for the ones like Math/Stats or CS/EE since these fields actively deal with logical arguments (it is quite literally a foundational aspect of the work they do).Engineering degrees still hold promise though additional schooling seems to be becoming increasingly necessary from talking to some of my engineering peers. However I believe this is not just restricted to engineering. Other STEM fields like Biology, Chemistry, Mathematics, Physics, etc. also require additional schooling in order to secure a comfortable salary and good job security. Nevertheless engineering degrees are still valuable and can lead to some good, stable careers and obviously medicine (if you can make it to med school or dental school and not drop out) promises a good career assuming you‚Äôre not a really shitty doctor. Additionally there are options in physical/occupational therapy and nursing, but it does appear that these fields are becoming more and more competitive to enter as there are more and more people applying for these jobs, so beware of this trend.The common theme among these majors that provide the best job outlook is because the knowledge and experience gained in their undergraduate (or master‚Äôs) years is in demand and directly provides the necessary and high-demand talent employers in these industries need. You can argue this is the case for all majors but if you have an undergraduate degree in Theater, your talents aren‚Äôt competitive for the high-paying jobs people in these other areas have access to and the field is very competitive.For the sake of the argument, let‚Äôs examine the field of Data Science. In recent years, this is the new hot buzz word for a career. Basically this is the role of a mathematician or statistician in an industry setting though there is research being done in ivory towers in this area as well. Let‚Äôs say you are looking to hire somebody for a new data science role and you have two applicants, A and B.

808,"Just a hint: Google is a wonderful thing. Just Google burglary robbery and you get What's the Difference Between Burglary, Robbery, and Theft? What's the Difference Between Burglary, Robbery, and Theft?By Daniel Taylor, Esq. on January 5, 2015 9:39 AM¬† Although burglary, robbery, and theft are often used interchangeably, there are distinct differences between the three.What the three have in common, of course, is that they all may involve the unauthorized taking of someone's personal property by another person (aka stealing). But beyond this shared link, burglary, robbery, and theft are all different crimes.What are the differences between the three?Theft/LarcenyTheft is the most basic of the three crimes. A theft occurs any time there in an unauthorized taking of property from another with the intent to permanently deprive that person of the property.In most states, the common law crime of larceny has been merged into a general ""theft"" crime. But in some states, larceny may be considered its own criminal offense, occurring when a person unlawfully takes and carries away another person's personal property without consent and with the intent to permanently deprive the owner.Robbery So if stealing something is theft, then what is robbery? Robbery is essentially theft accomplished through the use of physical force or fear.For example, someone stealing your purse after you set it down on a table and walked away would be theft. But someone stealing your purse by demanding you hand it over in a threatening way or by violently snatching it away from you would be robbery.BurglaryThe crime of burglary, though most often equated with theft, doesn't actually require that a theft occur, or even be intended. Burglary is simply the unlawful entry into a structure, such as a home or business, with the intent to commit a crime inside. Although many burglaries involve theft, the crime intended can be any crime from theft, to murder, to making pot brownies.A person can be charged with burglary regardless of whether the crime intended was actually committed. Additionally, the unlawful entry into the structure need not be accomplished by breaking and entering (although that is often the case). Rather, the entry merely must merely be unlawful, such as trespass through an unlocked door."
809,"I've done both, and unless your Machine Learning course involves Probabilistic Graphical Models, I'd say No. Even for Probabilistic Graphical Models, you'd probably do Bayesian Networks, which can be studied without extensive knowledge of Graph Theoretic concepts. The 2 can be phenomenally unrelated.A standard course in Graph Theory would define a Graph mathematically, and move on to enumerate a few properties of relationships between Edges & Vertices, the structures of Graphs and their properties, and Algorithms.Machine Learning relies heavily on Statistics, Linear Algebra and Computational Learning Theory. The latter is not stressed on too much in an Undergraduate course. Classification, Regression and Kernels can form a bulk of the Vector Space model stuff, and then you move on to Probabilistic Models. Personally, I was not very thrilled with the level of formalization, or Mathematical depth in Machine Learning, which is why I lost interest in it at some point down the lane. Graph Theory, on the other hand, is a very abstract and well developed subject (Algebraic Graph Theory, Topological Graph Theory, Extremal Graph Theory). To make contributions there would require substantial abstraction skills & creativity, good Proof-Writing skills and a fairly deep knowledge of some pretty fundamental Math. It's easier to make contributions in Machine Learning as its new, still developing and fairly naive (atleast Mathematically) in some sense. However, it all comes down to interest. Take both courses, and treat them to be independent of each other so that you can gauge your interest and skill in both. They're both good to have. See what you like and move on from there. For now, however, these 2 fields don't have too much in common.If you have to choose one, then I'd say a more Mathematically rigorous and abstract person may enjoy Graph Theory as a first step into a large world of deeper concepts and linkage with fields like Topology and Combinatorics (and Algorithms). A more experimental, hands-on and hungry-to-try-things person might enjoy Machine Learning a tad more.Hope this helps!"

815,"Tear or wear in anal opening below the dentate line is fissures. One of the most painful anal disorders that is caused by intense pressure of hard stools, diarrhea, pregnancy or child birth and sometimes caused by trauma. Sometimes it can be a worse conditions than piles and hemorrhoids too.Constipation and passing of hard stools is a result of regular indigestion and acidity. So to cure fissures permanently, you need to treat these causes first otherwise fissure will comeback everytime you treat it. However, we have divided fissures treatment in four stages so that it can be cured permanently and you would get a fissures free life.For the detailed Note on How To Cure Fissures Permanently , for a Fissures free life you can visit the original article here.First Stage TreatmentThis is the instant treatment for the pain and itching associated with it. You need to take some medicine for fissures, like ointments and painkillers fo instant effect. Fissures ointments like GNT (Glycerine Tri Nitrate) ointment have magical effect on fissures.It will heal fissures and will alleviate the burns and itching symptoms. However there are some side effects like dizziness, nausea and minor headaches. So it is recommended to use a pea size amount of the ointment only.For pain, you can use a normol dose of paracetamol or ibuferene.Second Stage TreatmentThe second stage treament involves lowering of pressure on anal opening. This can be done by taking stool softeners and drinking lot of water. Once you will have softer bowel movement, you will see that your constipation has gone and fissures will be cured eventually. Take medicines for diarrhea to lower the harsh effect on anal lining. Avoid anal sex, because that will make the condition even worse.Third Stage TreatmentThird Stage fissures treatment involves treating your indigestion and digestive problems, that had actually caused syptoms of constipation and hard stools. Acidity is one of major reason of indigestion, that irritates stomaches and intestines. You should take antacids to nutrilize the effect of acidity and hear burns.Final Stage TreatmentThe final stage treatment is nothing other than changing your lifestyle. Nurture healthy habits and follow healthy diet full of high fiber foods and avoid unhealthy habits and diet, that's all you have to do for the permanent cure. Avoid sedently lifestyle and excessive sitting and biking to avoid fissures. Similarly avoid junk foods and spicy foods, because these foods triggers fissures irritation and itching. Include yoga like breathing exercises ( Kapalbhatti) and shoulder stand ( Sarvangasana) to counter the effects of fissure and to lower the pressure in anal area. Additionally you can take some ayurvedic patanjali medicines for piles and Fissures like anal problems.So follow these treatments, and do this like a targeted goal to achieve. Your strategic approach will help you cure fissures permanently."
816,"First of all, I‚Äôm guessing by a high score you mean 330 - 340. Do not at all get afraid by all the propaganda that it is something extremely tough to achieve. It is not.I am not someone extraordinary. I failed countless, meaningless exams in my life. I have never been a topper or even close to that. So trust me, when I say, it is an extremely achievable target.Like any successful recipe, this also begins with some ingredients:Magoosh GRE Material (Verbal and Quants)Manhattan 5 lb. bookManhattan Mock Test Series (A set of 6 mock tests)Magoosh Flashcards (Available for free)Official ETS MaterialConfidence that you can do itGive yourself 2 - 3 months for preparation. Prepare a timeline.First things first, complete the Magoosh GRE Material videos. Both Verbal and Quants. They will take you quite some time. But they will be more than helpful in jogging old memories and clearing out the rust on those 10th standard mathematics that are already there but have been dormant being unused.Understand more importantly the process they are following to solve. Mathematics will follow straightforward logic, whereas Verbal might seem a little illogical at first, but really it is not. For Verbal it is VERY important to know the EXACT meaning of the words (Where constant practice from Magoosh Flashcards will help you) and also the structure and overall meaning of the sentence provided. Once you start getting the hang of it, you will start to understand the meaning and tone of the sentence, both in Reading Comprehension passages and Text Completions.Next, you MUST complete the ETS Official Guides, all 3 of them. There will be 2 mock tests provided in the book. Make sure you complete them and try to bring a score of +/- 2 from your target score. For example, for me the target score was 330, so I targeted for 328 - 332 in the ETS mocks.Next, the Manhattan 5 lb. book will be immensely helpful. Practice as much as you can each day. Doing BOTH Quants and Verbal. Complete the book by doing each and every problem and going through the answers that you did wrong or had confusion in. Also, make timelines (I did every alternate day) and give the 6 mocks one by one from Manhattan during this period. These mocks are a lot harder than actual GRE, so if you are scoring 318 - 322, expect a high score in GRE.Last but not the least, read, understand and memorize the words from Magoosh Flashcards. They will come extremely handy when you‚Äôre doing RC or TC.In the end, believe in yourself. Practice a lot and be confident of your ability. Most importantly, drink a lot of fluids! (Not just before the exam though - your washroom time is counted as the exam time except for breaks)Have a blast with the exam! All the best!"
817,"Yes and free from religious dogma.? A soul is a spark of conscious energy. There are many varying sizes of souls. There is a soul in your body, the soul of the Sun, the soul of the planets, and well..., everything has soul. Soul is the reason things in the universe started coalescing into life. Soul is the reason nature follows the PHI ratio. If you have ever researched the sound of sacred geometry, you realize wave propagation is what causes life to exist. A sound or a word, but I like to call it frequency. There is clearly intelligent organization to the universe. Who are we to say what is alive, and what is not? What is conscious, and what is not.¬† When we look at the universe, we see electromagnetic fields everywhere. These electromagnetic fields contain the frequency and information to make life happen. Did you ever wonder why snowflakes all have different patterns, but they're all in a five sided shape? The universe is electromagnetic field within electromagnetic field. There is an electromagnetic field inside the human body that can be detected 10 feet outside the body during the emotion love. We have always thought the heavenly bodies produced the electromagnetic field. I think it is the electromagnetic field that's sweep matter into what we know as reality. Did you know every electromagnetic field takes the shape of a Torah. These fields¬† spiral out in both directions, from a center, or source. The bigger the electromagnetic field, the more information contained within. It is absolutely impossible for life to randomly come about. There is a sound, that causes everything, form spiral snail shells, to the Fibonacci pattern that spirals out of flowers when they bloom. Scientist have a hard time describing what exactly a field is. When you look at the universe and nature, you see this pattern in everything. The planet hold our magnetic field in, we call it gravity. The Sun holds all the planets in place. The Galaxy hold the Sun in place. The universe holds the galaxy in place, and I have no doubt the universe takes the same torroidial shape. The universe is probably held in place, by what scientists call, the multiverse. This field is present in life. These fields are present in planets. These fields are present in stars. These fields are present in galaxies. It is not a human body, it is a biomechanical quantum supercomputer. The bigger the field, the more information contained within. Field, held within field, infinitely. They can't get a solar system to form¬† in computer simulations, with gravity the only acting force. Furthermore how did everything haphazardly collide during the early formation of the solar system, with gravity as the only active force, and everything luckily settles on equator line of the Sun. That don't even make sense. There is the force of the wave. The wave is emitted from the field. The people who are sure souls don't exist, are the same people that said, you will never get a heavier than air craft off the ground. What causes the proteins and molecules to arrange in certain patterns, the wave. What causes snowflakes to freeze in a five-sided beautiful geometric pattern, the wave. What they teach us in school, is not the truth. If you want a better understanding, YouTube the sound of sacred geometry. If you want to know why snowflakes take the five Side pattern every time they fall . YouTube The Flower of Life. I was a smug atheist until an episode of the universe was showing solar system formation. They were describing planet hitting planet. Then everything ,¬† as if by miracle , or grace of God , just settles on the ecliptic plane of our star. Really? If gravity is the only acting force as we were taught in school, shouldn't we all hazardly orbit the Sun? That's an explanation, by our scientists, not a very realistic one. Some people when offered the easiest explanation,¬† just go with it, No research. As long as the person telling has some kind of indoctrinated teaching, most people accept it. If you think of space as a calm pool of water. Then think of the Sun as a giant pebble, dropped into that calm water. The waves would be tight at the epicenter, then get wider and wider the further they got from the source of the wave. Look at the size of the planets in our solar system. They are really small close to the Sun, As the wave gets wider more, and more, debri migrates to the lower part of the wave. That is why the planet sizes are small close to the Sun, and the further you get out, the bigger the planets get. Of course this could all be a coincidence, but at least I am NOT accepting the easiest answer given, or dening truth's, in defence my own way of thinking. It isn't science vs religion. It is simply divide and conquer. It makes it easier to control us. It is called common sense, because we look at the commonalities, and try to make sense of them."
818,"I have Jupiter retrogate in 1st house in sign of Gemini. My birth details are. 12 Dec 1989, 6:45 PM Indore. Having Gemini lagna, Jupiter in 1st house, saturn and mercury in 7th house, Venus and rahu in 8th house, mars and sun in 6th house, moon exalted in tauras in 12th house.Now let me tell you my Jupiter mahadasha started In 2014. Before that I have faced rahu maha dasha from 1996 to 2014. Just after starting Jupiter dasha I felt many changes in life especially I am diverted to sprituallity, astrology, now I am devotee, I cant do anything wrong even if I want to do. I think its because aspect of 9th lord saturn on 1st house as it is placed in 7th house. 9th lord and 10th lord mutually aspecting each other. Jupiter is in 1st house being the lord of 7th house and 10th house. Even though I have not got the success I am seeking but this Jupiter made me optimistik and Saturn aspect on lagn made me hardworking. Saturn aspect made me engineering professional. I am mechanical engineer and working with family business of heavy machines. I face hurdles but I don't have any complain to it. Because this Saturn is a promise for success but after hard work and that I like. Yes I have faced the worst time of my life between 2008-2011 rahu-Venus period. Felt in relation and hurted tooo much and experienced worst things and prayed got to take my life. This Jupiter always reminds my limits being a good human with morality . Jupiter in 1st house was also working that time, never made me to cross my limits and stoped me to do even a bit wrong. Yes rahu made me to some wrong but jupiter stopped to go to extreme of it. What I am saying extreme is normal now a days.Thus I have a very good character and yes one bad thing of this placement is I never compromise with wrong things even if my family members do any wrong deed. I appose them and by default cant see anything wrong happening around me. This makes people around me to fight me and yes one thing is sure I never lose the fight of right and wrong. the planets mars and sun in sixth house gives courage to win the battle. But it is very challenging placement now a days. But I cant do anything. Right now I am unmarried. Saturn in 7th house delaying it but will give good result. just after Jupiter dasha started in 2014 I gained 15-20kg weight. I am not overweight but under normal BMI. Before I was slim and now fine neither slim nor fat. I have fair complexion attractive look. Jupiter gives in 1st house. Yes it forces to walk on righteous path. Retrograte Jupiter is more strong. Yes it minimize the dosha effects in kundali by giving knowledge.(here in my case)As you can see Jupiter bent me towards astrology and sprituality and I am able to understand that whatever happened wrong to me because rahu-Venus. That was a karmic backlog I have from past life and I paid it in specific period. And next I got hint to what bad and good going to be happen in futur. Thus I have did some good deed so I got Jupiter in 1st house. Its slow moving planet will give results slowely.Overall it protects in many ways. It tells what is right what is wrong. And if make us realize to improve ourself before saying others wrong. And one can study my chart and ask me if want to ask anything about any placement and result.It is not a right thing to share birth details publicly but if anyone wants to study and learn from live examples he can learn and ask.ThanksArpit Verma"
819,"India is right after China when it comes to countries with high level of air pollution. The government needs to take immediate measure otherwise the air will soon go from unhealthy to hazardous. Here are a few steps that can be taken-A proper and clean public transport will encourage citizens to avoid taking their own cars around. If the government can successfully reduce the number of cars on the roads, there will be a considerable improvement in the quality of air.When China made an initiative to control its population, they observed a decline in their pollution level gradually. Indian government needs to take the same measures to control the level of population as it has positive impact on the environment.Trees help in maintaining the quality of air and deforestation has lead to a decrease in the air quality. Restricting deforestation altogether and planting more trees will help in improving the air quality.Monitoring the air quality in local areas and spreading awareness among citizens about the AQI in their areas is an essential step towards reducing the air pollution. Furthermore, the government should encourage individuals to use a smart air quality monitor in their homes, and offices to measure indoor air quality on a personal level and take preventive measures when the air is unhealthy."

One evening, I was allowed to visit her in the ICU.Till that day I had seen ICU‚Äôs only in movies.I put on the scrubs and walked in. I passed through three other patients before seeing my mom.I became numb. The huge machines were beeping. There were catheters and tubes attached all over my mother. She looked completely pale. She spoke to me for a little while. She complained that she hasn‚Äôt even had a sip of water for three days (She was being tube fed). She complained that her compression stockings were too tight (Compression stockings are tight socks used after surgery to prevent blood clots developing in the leg) I loosened them for her. The duty doctor arrived. My mother introduced me to the doctor. She told her that I had donated blood for her and that I was very brave. And she cried.I stood there with a blank face. Bottling up my emotions is something that I am very good at. So I neither smiled nor shed a tear. I stood there expressionless.My five minutes were over and I was asked to leave.That was the worst moment of my life.I came outside and my dad dropped me till the bus stop so I could go home. It was a forty minute bus ride from the hospital.Sitting in the bus, I was texting my crush. During those hard times, he was my biggest emotional support. He knew that I liked him. I had confessed to him long back.He was from another city, so we mostly communicated through texts.While we were texting, he started saying weird things. Then he confessed to me that he liked me too!With crappy mobile data, I was having trouble sending and and receiving the texts (I was using 2G back then). I was very nervous and very, very confused.It was a very funny conversation.I was ecstatic! I looked out of the bus window. It was almost dark, and the whole city was decked up in lights to celebrate my happiness! (But actually, those were the lights from the vehicles stuck in the huge traffic jam) I was smiling ear to ear. I was so happy I started trembling. It was also a bit chilly outside. I just wanted to jump up and down because I was very happy!. I somehow managed my excitement, and got down at my stop. I just wanted to keep talking to him but I had to walk back home from the bus stop. I had the biggest smile on my face.That was the best moment of my life.Later in the evening I got to know that my mom will be discharged from the ICU and will sent home in a week. Everybody in my family was happy because my mom would be home to celebrate the Dusshera festival.So, those were the worst and best moments of my life, on the same day.Edit: Many people in the comments asked about my mom‚Äôs health . Thank you so much for your love. My mom has recovered and is doing really great now <3As for my crush, we dated for a while but we are not together now.Thanks for reading (:"

832,"If you mean what goes on in the body when a person has an autoimmune disease, let me first explain how the normal immune system works...How The Immune System WorksThe body's immune system protects you¬† from disease-causing agents such as viruses, bacteria, fungi and other harmful substances shown above by producing antibodies. Antibodies are proteins that recognize foreign harmful substances that invade the body.¬†¬† Once these antibodies recognize these disease-causing substances as harmful foreign bodies, they fight them off by destroying them.What Happens When A Person Has An Autoimmune DisorderHowever, when a person has an autoimmune disease, there's an abnormality in the way the immune system responds.auto = self or same in Greek....his own immune system produces antibodies against his own tissues.¬†¬† These antibodies attack the person's own healthy tissues. They're treating the person's own healthy cells as if they're foreign bodies.¬† Since the healthy tissues are being attacked by his own immune system, organ destruction or dysfunction will occur.¬† Example: Let's take Type I Diabetes (not included in photo above)The pancreas, that gland you see below, is attacked by a person's own immune system.¬† The antibodies are treating the pancreas as foreign to the body. As a result, the beta cells in the pancreas (photo below) are destroyed. Therefore, the beta cells¬† produce little or no insulin, a hormone that transports glucose (sugar) in the body's cells to be used as energy.¬†This is why patients with Type I Diabetes need to inject insulin since it's not being produced.¬† As a matter of fact, the old name for this disease was Insulin-Dependent Diabetes (IDD).Now, if your question meant what causes the abnormal immune response that leads to an autoimmune disease, it's unknown.¬† That's why there's no cure for those common autoimmune diseases shown in the third picture."

I‚Äôm running 16-bit games that have been in storage for almost 20 years in Windows 10, something not possible with earlier versions such as Windows 7! The registry hack is as follows:Open regedit.exe from an elevated command prompt.Locate HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Windows and locate CSDVersion within the key. Right click and modify the key value to 100The above must be accomplished PRIOR to installation of the game. After modification of the key, navigate to the game‚Äôs DVD and ‚Äòright-click‚Äô on the ‚Äòsetup.exe‚Äô file in the GTA IV folder, choose properties and check the ‚Äòrun this program in compatibility mode‚Äô and choose Windows XP SP3.

834,"Foremost thing that matters in clearing any competitive exam is the approach and direction. This is further dependent on the Faculty, Study Material, Mentoring and other important factors.Many of us get into some institutes where a lot of students have already given there attempts 3‚Äì4 times or batch strength is more than 30. A beginner can never understand and start from the concepts in these kind of classes. Also, some institutes hire inexperienced faculty and do injustice to their students.I would suggest look for an institute where initially you can attend free demo classes(more than 1), Study material should be updated, faculty who is expert in their subjects like Quant, LR, GS or English, and provide updated testing environment.I have a keen interest in guiding aspirants for govt. jobs and other fields too. I researched about various institutions in Chandigarh by visiting and attending demo classes. I found some are really good in teaching but batch sizes are 30+, some have good material and testing but faculty is inexperienced.There was one institute in Sector 34-A named ‚ÄúMy Career‚Äù. They have started the institute afresh in Chandigarh although have quite well-reputed center in Bathinda (as some sources told me from the city). Main benefit is it is run by IIM Alumni and very experienced faculty who have actually taught students for MBA. Study material is also fine. Major plus point here would be that they have started in the city, so they are really working hard to give good results and provide good coaching & training to students and hence excel in the league. So, after all research and counsel, I would recommend My Career Institute to all for SSC and Banking Coaching. You guys can atleast visit and attend demo classes there. All the Best !! :)"

They go through reserves.Stuff like depreciation is complicated depending what it is. Head office building it comes after gross profit.

Each and everyday, each and every night I use to promise myself saying that tomorrow I will wake up early in the morning even during exams !. But that ‚ÄúTomorrow‚Äù never used to come. With all my force and effort I used to wake up sometimes but the gravitational force was so high that every time I used to lose the battle against it.I was not a morning person at all. So I have decided to do something for it.

You can change any method of turning off the alarm here. Trust me it worked really for me.If you are smart enough to switch off the phone while buzzing it can automatically restart and again starts buzzing .If you want to uninstall it can‚Äôt be uninstalled until and unless ‚ÄúPrevent app uninstall‚Äù is turned on.In fact, there are lot of apps available in the market you can download any of such apps which you found it very useful.This is the screenshot of my history showing that how many times in a month I woke up on time.Pretty much useful isn‚Äôt it?Not only an app helps in waking up early but also a self motivation towards it does !!"

841,"I‚Äôm Canadian technically, but let‚Äôs go with India.Map of the Indian Subcontinent, circa 1782On January 14, 1761, tens of thousands of Marathas march to break the siege at Panipat. Knowing the desperate nature of their struggle, they know they must win.The battle starts. The Marathas fight bravely, but their adversary, the Afghans, right with better tactics. Maratha after Maratha falls, but unlike in our timeline, the Maratha commander issues a retreat order. When the Marathas retreat and regroup, they launch one final attack, capturing an Afghan camp. And tons and tons of food. With more time before they starve, the Maratha commanders send desperate pleas to the Jats and Sikhs to intervene. With no response for the next four days, the Marathas lose hope. They leave the camp for one final fight with the Afghans. However, before both sides can battle each other, in the distance, the Marathas spot thousands of Jat and Sikh troops charging the Afghan lines. Within hours, the Afghans are smited and Abdali runs away, back to Afghanistan. With the Marathas severely weakened, and their Mughal enemies still in Delhi, Jassa Singh Ahluwalia, the leader of the Sikhs, and Suraj Mal, the leader of the Jats, decide to unite their armies, and over the next few days, they steamroll through to Delhi, conquering the Taqt-e-Hind, while the Marathas focus on restoring order. With the now domains of the Sikhs and the Jats now united, they have greater bargaining power over the Marathas, and keep their domains, while the Marathas are stuck with their own weakened Empire. The Marathas retain control over their core land of Maharashtra, the Malwa region (Madhya Pradesh), and Gujarat. Meanwhile, the Sikh-Jat Union gains full control of Eastern Punjab, Delhi, and Haryana. The united armies of the Sikhs, Marathas, and Jats pacify Rajasthan, and it is annexed into the Maratha domains. Over the next year, both unions build their power as Abdali cowers from Peshawar. Then, the Marathas quickly annex the Sindh, while the Sikhs and Jats conquer Western Punjab all the way up till the doorstep of Afghanistan, due to their newfound wealth from Delhi. With the Marathas and Sikhs and Jats occupied with the West, new developments take place in the East. The Zamindars of Oudh, bolstered by the fall of the Mughal Empire, quickly annex all of modern day Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand, establishing the Dominion of Oudh, which is ruled by noble Zamindars. Inspired by the changes throughout the rest of India, in a near-miracle, Southern Indian regions come together, despite their differences, and merge into Dravida, a benevolent oligarchy ruled by the former Kings. Soon, Dravida invades Sri Lanka as well, conquering it. Meanwhile, with most of India united under the Maratha Empire, Dravida, the Punjab Raj (the new union between the Jats and Sikhs), and the Dominion of Awadh, Clive‚Äôs Bengal feels the pressure of united front. Soon enough, a revolution occurs in Bengal, lead by the mercantile elite of Bengal. Supported by the Oudhis, who need a friendly state with access to the sea, the British are slowly driven out of Bengal, and Bengal is established as a (semi-flawed) republic dominated by the merchants who eventually lead Bengal to conquer lots of the other areas of India too. Now, this is the map of India circa 1776, when Bengal got its freedom:Blue: The Republic of PunjabPurple: The Maratha FederationGreen: The Republic of BengalGold: The Dominion of Awadh (formerly Oudh)Red: The Dravidian ConfederationEach of these nations, by 1782, turns out to be very different, with quite interesting politics playing out.The Maratha FederationCentred in the city of Pune, a new competent Maratha administration decentralizes the power to an extent.

843,"Well, one is capable of entirely disobeying Newtons Third law, capable of wielding many different types of magic, adept at many skills like stealth, archery, wielding swords, and even has the support of deities. One has a red lightsaber with a hilt, the hilt having (argubly) little effect due to his inexperience*** (Read the P.S).I think i see a new body decorating the walls of Windhelm (or Solitude).Ok now, let's have a few theoretical battles, for fairness. Say these two were pitted against each other in a sword fight, with the Dovahkiin using a Daedric sword and shield, and Kylo using his signature lightsaber. In theory, Ebony would be able to either cut straight through, or entirely block, a lightsaber blade. So, Dovahkiin could block with the shield, and then, using Kylo's hilt to his advantage, trap the sword within the clawlike shapes of the shield, and wrench it from his grasp. Now Kylo has no weapon, against someone very experienced with a sword, currently wielding a Daedric blade.Dovah - 1. Kylo - 0.Ok, how about a magic/thu'um vs force battle.Well, Kylo would probably just choke the Dovahkiin outright, or invade his mind and force him to forfeit. If he could react fast enough, he might be able to begin burning Kylo or something, but probably not.Dovah - 1. Kylo - 1.Ranged vs Lightsaber?Dovahkiin would fire a single ebony arrow, and even if kylo tried to block it, the arrowhead would cut straight through the plasma of the blade and hit him. If he cut the shaft in half, chances are the arrow won't lose enough momentum.Dovah - 2. Kylo - 1.So, from these 3 examples, the chances are that if Dovah has daedric weapons and enough speed to reach him before he is forced to forfeit, he'd win easily.(P.S while it's said on Wookieepedia that Kylo is a good lightsaber user, Ren defeated him, and she doesn't approach the sword skills of Dovah)"

848,"According to IELTS Home of the English Language Test: ‚ÄúIELTS is the high-stakes English test for study, migration or work‚Äù. The test is an examination of your ability to communicate effectively in English Language when applying to study, work, or immigrate to the UK, Canada, Australia and New Zealand. It is also acceptable in many other countries.There are two types IELTS tests:IELTS Academic for those planning to study in English at tertiary level or professional certifications.IELTS General Training for those moving to work, study at secondary level, attend training programmes or for immigration.Regardless of the type, candidates are generally tested under four major communication modes:Listening: examines how well and how fast you can comprehend day-to-day verbal communication in diverse settings (e.g. talking to a customer care officer on phone, discussion among students, academic lectures, briefings at a museum etc.). You listen to a recorded audio without repeat and you record your responses in provided answer sheets.Reading: here you are tested on ho well you comprehend written text from regular publications (e.g. news articles, educational articles, guides/manuals, etc). You have to read a number of passages, adverts, or manuals and answer questions about them in a booklet.Speaking: Here you need to demonstrate your ability to hold a conversation in English comfortably even at increasing difficulty. You will speak one-on-one with an examiner who will ask you a variety of questions starting from introducing yourself, family, work or educational background etc., to more complicated topics bothering current global issues, or abstract topics. Your speech is recorded during the test.Writing: Here you demonstrate your ability to communicate effectively in written English in both formal and informal settings. First you are asked to write a letter (formal or informal) and then, in the second part, you are required to write an essay such as an argumentative essay on a given topic. For example, you may be asked to write a friend to ask about the nature of a city you‚Äôre planning to relocate to in the first question or asked to explain your position about an issue such as ‚ÄúTraditionally, people think the concept of family applies to the conventional setting of a man (father), a woman (mother) and children while in today‚Äôs society some think the family should be broadened to include non-conventional settings of a man (woman), a man (woman) and children‚Äù.Candidates can earn maximum of 9 points per section. The final score is aggregated over the four sections and normalised to 9 points. This is then graded according to the IELTS scale.In general, there is no fail and pass score, it depends on the requirement of the organisation or purpose for which the test is taken. However, the higher your score the better."
849,"With ease as losing weight has zero to do with exercise. It‚Äôs all about nutrition.Firstly here is what not to do!Follow any advice that suggests consuming less calories than you burn. Although this sounds logical it ignores how the body works and sadly ignores every meaningful, large study over years.The very best study ever done on caloric reduction as a path to lasting weight loss showed that it failed. The Women‚Äôs Health Initiative, a gigantic randomized controlled trial,followed almost 50,000 womenover seven and a half years.One group of the women followed a low-fat, low-calorie diet high in grains, fruits, and vegetables and reduced their total daily calories by 361 calories. They also increased their amount of exercise by 14 percent.The other group followed their usual diet.The first group was expected to show weight loss. The other group was not expected to see any weight loss.The final results were a complete shock to everybody involved.The actual difference in weight loss between the two groups was not even two pounds!Worse still, the average waist size in the low-calorie, increased-exercise group grew from 35 to 35.4 inches. These 25,000 women who so carefully followed the ‚Äúeat less, move more‚Äù strategy for so long actually ended up fatter than ever. Source :Dr Jason FungSuper hard workouts or intense cardio type suggestions! Don‚Äôt follow for weightlossworking out is for fitness, function and health.The most famous study on exercise followed 13,000 runners over decades. Complied by RUNNERS WORLD, these runners were highly active. The results of miles and miles of running? All 13,000 were fatter after every decade!(I have plenty of big studies that prove both, again please don‚Äôt quote back small studies, with selected people, over short durations; they don‚Äôt stand up to scrutiny)So if;eating less moving more is not the answer,calorie deficit is not the answer,insane amounts of cardio is not the answer.WHAT IS THE ANSWER?When I say not the answer, I mean long term, permanent weightloss. Please don‚Äôt quote studies that have less than 100 people, over less than a year. They are meaningless studies and often funded by food or drink companies.So to get rid of fat; it‚Äôs all down to understanding one thing.How the body stores or burns fat.This process is controlled by two hormones (insulin and glucagon) that work like scales. Too much insulin and you‚Äôll store fat, no insulin and glucagon can do it‚Äôs job and burn fat.The proof that hormones control fat storing and burning is common knowledge in the medical world and is not controversial. Yes there are hormones that control hunger and feeling full but in the end it‚Äôs all about being a fat burner or sugar burner.Don‚Äôt eat refined carbohydrates, sugars and fructoseYes without a doubt that‚Äôs all you need to do. It‚Äôs the most natural way the body works.The Ketogenic diet works this way.High fat, low carb works this way andIntermittent fasting (eating nothing for at least 16 hours per day every week or so) works this way.They lower insulin levels and raise glucagon levels.Those that say it‚Äôs unhealthy to try ketogenic, intermittent fasting or low carb diets seem to be promoting the current western diet that gives you a 1‚Äì3 chance of either high blood pressure, obesity or diabetes. So I think we can assume that the ‚Äònormal‚Äô way to eat is actually not that healthy! Anyway I digress‚Ä¶This problem of raising insulin also explains why eating little and often is making fat loss slow or impossibleYou do not need 6 small meals a day, it‚Äôs ridiculous to think humankind in 140,000 years of existence has made the NEED for this CONSTANT feeding part of our day to day functioning.Our body‚Äôs need only 2 meals a day, 3 tops. We can actually go days without food. The longest fast on record is 382 days. Here are two graphs that illustrate why eat little and often is not a good methodHERE ARE EXAMPL..."
850,"Since I got into digital 10 years ago I have been a fan of compacts, for lots of reasons, but one thing I really like is being able to turn off all sounds, including the ‚Äúshutter.‚Äù Compacts (so far as I know) don't actually have shutters; they expose the sensor electronically, which is why your live view blanks out for the fraction of a second that the ‚Äúshutter‚Äù is ‚Äúfiring.‚Äù My latest camera is an upgrade from a Nikon P7800. I bought a gently used Sony RX-10 and I am nuts about it. One reason why is, like my previous compacts, I can shut off all sounds; no beeps, no clicks, no nuthin'. Stealth shooting. I love to shoot in museums but I don't like to attract attention (just shy). No shutter sound lets me work quietly making natural family candids. The whoooosh-thunk of a DSLR mirror and shutter are real attention getters, exactly what I don't want. I find that with the camera mashed to my face I can still hear a little whisper click when it ‚Äúfires,‚Äù and of course the electronic viewfinder blacks out. There's no reason to worry that you can't tell if it's firing.I got the .pdf of the RX-100 III and found on page 27, in the setup menu, a reference to audio signals, setting the operating sounds. That should be where you can go in and turn off all the sounds, including the ‚Äúshutter.‚Äù"

852,"I believe Captain Blackadder put it best.Baldrick: The thing is: The way I see it, these days there's a war on, right? and, ages ago, there wasn't a war on, right? So, there must have been a moment when there not being a war on went away, right? and there being a war on came along. So, what I want to know is: How did we get from the one case of affairs to the other case of affairs?Edmund: Do you mean ""Why did the war start?""Baldrick: Yeah.George: The war started because of the vile Hun and his villainous empire-building.Edmund: George, the British Empire at present covers a quarter of the globe, while the German Empire consists of a small sausage factory in Tanganyika. I hardly think that we can be entirely absolved of blame on the imperialistic front.George: Oh, no, sir, absolutely not. [aside, to Baldick] Mad as a bicycle!Baldrick: I heard that it started when a bloke called Archie Duke shot an ostrich 'cause he was hungry.Edmund: I think you mean it started when the Archduke of Austro-Hungary got shot.Baldrick: Nah, there was definitely an ostrich involved, sir.Edmund: Well, possibly. But the real reason for the whole thing was that it was too much effort not to have a war.George: By Golly, this is interesting; I always loved history...Edmund: You see, Baldrick, in order to prevent war in Europe, two superblocs developed: us, the French and the Russians on one side, and the Germans and Austro-Hungary on the other. The idea was to have two vast opposing armies, each acting as the other's deterrent. That way there could never be a war.Baldrick: But this is a sort of a war, isn't it, sir?Edmund: Yes, that's right. You see, there was a tiny flaw in the plan.George: What was that, sir?Edmund: It was bollocks.Baldrick: So the poor old ostrich died for nothing.Ok, fine, this simplifies things just a tad. But it‚Äôs more accurate than it should be. We can add to this an insane level of Serbian nationalism that held that Serbs were the best and brightest in the world, and they‚Äôd easily beat Austria-Hungary in any war. This is rather like an ant who believes it could defeat the elephant, when the reality is that the elephant could step on it without knowing.The entangled alliances made things worse. The Serbs struck out at AH through their agents in the Black Hand (possibly the best terrorist group name ever), AH responded with a series of ultimata. Serbia accepted most, but wanted time to sort out a couple of them, but Austria-Hungary wasn‚Äôt having that, and attacked. Serbia went crying to their big brother, Russia, who then got involved, which forced Germany to join in on Austria‚Äôs side, which required France to join in on Russia‚Äôs side, and then Germany violated Belgian neutrality, which forced the UK to enter alongside the French and Russians. Soon the Ottomans were joining Germany and Austria (which is slightly ironic on a historical level), and Italy threw in on the side of the allies.Here‚Äôs the fun part: pretty much everyone thought the war would be over quickly. They all figured, in their own way, that they‚Äôd go give Johnny Foreigner a good thrashing and be home in time for Christmas. They all assumed that God was on their side, and they‚Äôd win easily, and topple the enemy.So Serbian nationalism, mixed in with entangling alliances, and extreme overconfidence and arrogance on the part of every power involved, all combined in the most toxic way imaginable, and just like that a whole continent was burning. And once the shooting began, almost everyone succumbed to a version of the Sunk-Cost Fallacy; ‚Äúif we stop fighting now, then all our boys would have died for nothing!‚ÄùThere are so many chances for this war to have been prevented.Serbia could have accepted the ultimatum and put up with the Austrians causing havoc for a few days until their honor was satisfied.Russia could have found a way to mobilize only against Austria, and not against Germany as well.The UK and France could have made it clear that they weren‚Äôt going to get involved.Germany could have honored Belgian neutrality, thus avoiding the first steps at getting America into the war.But alas, once the guns of August began to fire, there was no stopping it. Millions died to no good cause, governments around Europe toppled, Communism took over in Russia, and the stage was set for the even more horrible sequel.Such a horrible, tragic waste."
853,"To get over your Fear of driving. Take a pen and paper.Write down why you are afraid of driving, just brainstorm. Use short sentences and write them below each other.For example:I fear driving because I am afraid to create an accidentI fear driving because I am afraid to hurt myself in a car accidentI fear driving because I don‚Äôt feel confidentI fear driving because I can‚Äôt concentrate well enough, etc.Realize with the statements you made why you are afraid of driving, that all these are your thoughts about driving.Now, A fear is just an expectation that something negative is going to happen in the future. Fear doesn't really exist on the moment in which you live. It is important to know that your negative thoughts, create your negative emotion like fear.Take another paper and write here the opposite thoughts of someone who is not afraid of driving. Add even extra positive recommendations if you can find them.For example:I like driving, because it brings me from one place to another.I like driving, because I have my license and I can drive.I will take a few seconds longer every time I drive to watch, to make sure it is alright.I am confident that I can control the situation in the car at all times.I will have to trust myself and when I have doubt, I will slow down, but safely.I will start for a moment to drive on a parking lot, to gain my confidence again. There is all the space and I can experience driving without problems.When I return afterwards into a small area and try driving there and gain more confidence.Than I will drive every where, step by step, control my actions and believe I can drive easily and enjoy the fun of driving. etc.Above you found for example the positive thoughts someone has, when he or she is not afraid.NOW, the problem, you think negative thoughts, what create negative emotions like fear and even less confidence.How do we change it that you really believe the positive thoughts you have created?You have to know that your brain works with synapses to learn something. That means if you repeat something long enough you create a connection between subjects.For example.A little baby is hungry, feels bad in stomach, starts to cry, mother comes with food.Next, time it happens again, after a while. The baby has that bad feeling again, and has learned to cry because than the feeling will go away. The synapses in your brain makes connection between - hunger - bad feeling - cry - mother - food. Later the child knows hungry - cry - food. Later again hungry I will get some food. That is also how you learn history. You connect a date with a happening, repeat it over and over again, than you remember it and it BECOMES YOUR BELIEVE. YOUR PERSPECTIVE.In your case, you have made a list of positive thoughts not to be fearful of driving again, our positive thoughts. Read them over and over again, slowly intensively and again and again. Never talk or tell someone you are afraid of driving. Just repeat in conversations, you are not afraid. If you keep doing this, you program your mind to believe the positive thoughts you want to believe. This is scientific proven, and very simple explained.The nicest thing is that it works, for all fears in live and for all negative emotions you have in life. Just try it and see that it works. Than you will know it is the truth.Don‚Äôt forget your personality is not who you are, but WHAT you think.Good luck. More questions, let me know.Thomas Francisco Pelgero."

855,"The standard hard disk drive (HDD) has been the predominant storage device for desktop computers and laptops for a long time. But now, with the invention of solid state drive (SSD) technology, computer buyers and users now have access to the latest innovation that‚Äôs setting new trends in the storage market. So which one should you go for ‚Äì the HDD or SSD? Read on to find out.What is an HDD?A hard disk drive (HDD) is basically a storage device in a computer. It is comprised of metal platters with magnetic coating, spindle, and various moving parts to process and store data. The common size for laptop hard drives in the 2.5‚Äù model, while a larger 3.5‚Äù model is usually found in desktop computers.What is an SSD?A solid state drive (SSD) is also another type of data storage that performs the same job as an HDD. But insteading of storing data in a magnetic coating on top of platters, an SSD uses flash memory chips and an embedded processor to store, retrieve, and cache data. It is roughly about the same size as a typical HDD, and bears the resemblance of what smartphone batteries would look like.HDD and SSD ComparisonNow let‚Äôs take a closer look at the two devices. We break it down into the following main categories:SpeedThis is where SSDs truly prevail. While HDDs need a long time to access data and files because the disk must spin to find it, SSDs are up to 100 times faster since data can be accessed instantly. This is why an SSD-equipped PC will boot within seconds and deliver blazing fast speed for launching programs and applications, whereas a computer that uses a HDD will take much longer time to boot the operating system, and will continue to perform slower than an SSD during normal use.CapacityAs of writing, SSD units top out at 16TB storage capacity. Although there are large SSDs, anything that‚Äôs over 512GB is beyond most people‚Äôs price range. HDDs, on the other hand, have large capacities (1-2TB) available for much more affordable prices.DurabilityHDDs consist of various moving parts and components, making them susceptible to shock and damage. The longer you use your HDD, the more they wear down and most eventually end up failing. Meanwhile, an SSD uses a non-mechanical design of flash storage mounted on a circuit board, providing better performance and reliability, and making it more likely to keep your files and data safe.NoiseAn HDD can sometimes be the loudest part of your computer. Even the highest-performing HDDs will emit some noise when the drive is spinning back and forth to process data. SSDs have no moving parts, meaning it makes no noise at all.HeatMore moving part means more heat, and HDD users will have to live with the fact that their device will degenerate over time. SSD uses flash memory, generating less heat, helping to increase its lifespan.CostTo be frank, SSDs are much more expensive than HDDs for the same capacity. This is why most computers with an SSD only have a few hundred gigabytes of storage. HDDs are about twice as cheaper than SSDs.Despite the high costs and low capacity, SSD is a clear winner over the HDD in terms of performance. While you‚Äôre paying more for less memory with an SSD, you‚Äôre investing in a faster and far more durable data storage option in the long run.We recommend using an SSD as the primary storage for your operating system, applications, and most-used programs. You can install another HDD inside the same computer to store documents, movies, music, and pictures ‚Äì these files don‚Äôt need to leverage the incredible access times and speed of SSD.Looking to invest in some new hardware for your business?

858,"I routinely hire new immigrants with solid java/j2ee development experience in Auckland. My last hire was from India, and had been in NZ for three weeks when he started. He had a silver fern visa. The one before that was from China and here on a student visa doing post grad study in comp sci. The company I work for is less than 30% kiwi, and there are people from 10 different countries.The market for developers and testers in Auckland is robust, but it will depend on your years of experience, particular expertise, applied knowledge, and english fluency.Auckland is an immigrant city, and the skill shortage means that workplaces must be more diverse and open to immigrants than previous posters have suggested. Outside auckland may be a different story. Employers will be impatient with poor English. You need to have your visa sorted, and be in NZ for face to face interviews to be taken seriously.Jobs are on seek and trademe, but try to find a good agent who sees your potential and will market your unique skills effectively. They get a commission¬† from the employer equal to 12-17% of your first years salary, so they will work hard to find you a spot. Consider contracting if you visa will allow it. Kiwi employers are wary of candidates that have worked for mega-corporations on vast teams where their individual input on projects might be limited. This seems more common with applicants from India and China, and I've seen heaps of applicants with years of experience but limited accomplishments because they've spent years warming a chair and making up headcount for outsource consultancies like IBM. Kiwi employers are also wary of career advancement earned through study,¬† rather than on the job achievement. To combat this find some way to demonstrate applied skills and knowledge in your specialty area that is equal to your number of years experience. Show them that you can work independently and take initiative.Most NZ companies are much smaller by comparison, and they will expect you to adapt to the flatter heirarchies in NZ very quickly. The smaller size and informality can be a real culture shock, and¬† if you don't prove you can work independently then they will simply churn you within 90 days. Be prepared to make slightly less than market rates for your first year or two until you can acquire some NZ professional references.Good luck!"

863,"As someone who has fronted a band as a lead singer and knows very little about professional singing - I can agree with the consensus above that there is probably no substitute for a great coach. However - since you seem to be interested in doing it yourself - I think there are still a few things you can do to make yourself a lot better than you already are. Quick and dirty:1. PRACTICE. I can't emphasize this enough. Your singing voice is like a muscle that gets soft and mushy if you don't exercise it. You don't have to sing scales. I used to get tons of practice driving alone and singing at the very top of my lungs along with the radio or pre-recorded tunes -¬† with the windows rolled up. Please keep the windows rolled up. :)2. Practice breathing from your diaphragm. This might take a little work if you haven't done it before. One way to do this is to lie down on your back and place a book on your stomach. Practice taking deep breaths that fill up your belly and not just shallow lung filling breaths. The book should rise and fall - if it doesn't move, you aren't doing it right. Once you have that down - practice taking diaphragm breaths while singing and see how much more power your voice has.3. Try to be aware of your natural range, and where your voice crosses into a falsetto. Many people tend to sound nasally and flat when they hit higher notes because they are not opening up the back of their throat enough. Try singing some scales and when you cross into a higher range focus on creating space at the back of your soft palate by contracting it up like you are trying to hold a golf ball at the back of your tongue without swallowing it. ( sounds uncomforatble i know, but sometimes having a visual can help you do something that sounds or feels unnatural at first). Opening you mouth wider will also help with the nasally part.4. Over-enunciate. It will feel ridiculous - but it will sound better.These things won't make you a professional - but they will take you further than you think. As Sara mentioned it is also really instructive to record yourself so you can get a better idea of where you are experiencing trouble. I almost never know if something is a good take or not until I hear it played back. Most importantly, remember singing is fun, so try not take yourself too seriously - unless of course, you do -in which case you should probably take that lesson :)."

865,"Hello all.First of all, comparing Mr T to any of Ms Rand‚Äôs outspoken heroes is a bit of masking the man. Any of the heroes that Rand created spoke from integrity, not from personal self-aggrandizement. Mr T seems to lack the integrity necessary to have earned the right to say what he thinks and be respected by it, that is clear because he DOES say what he thinks and it is often pretty embarrassing, if not downright shameful.Another aspect that should be highlighted is the ‚Äúwant‚Äù vs. ‚Äúneed‚Äù theme Rand proposed in ‚ÄúAtlas‚Äù. That is, (simplifying horribly!), wanting something becomes the motivation behind going out and doing something in order to get something. Needing something implies that one need not do anything, they are entitled to it simply because they feel they need it‚Ä¶. which in ‚ÄúAtlas‚Äù was manifested by the whiny attitudes of the scum-bag characters that robbed steel and energy and finally shut down the country.And it is the ‚Äúfeel‚Äù part of need that is concerning here. I‚Äôve seen over and over again in interviews with public figures that seem to support Mr T that feeling trumps fact. Some have even gone so far as to assert that feeling that something is true is tantamount to it actually being true, despite evidence to the contrary. So, people feel that Obama has not done a good job as president, must be true. They feel that immigration is a threat to the American way of life, must be true. They feel (or read ‚Äúfear‚Äù) that terrorism is the number one issue to be dealt with, must be true.It is upon those ‚Äúfeelings‚Äù that Mr T is raking in the support and votes. He does not deal in facts, he deals in feelings, takes advantage of those feelings and makes empty promises to make those bad feelings go away‚Äî he will make America great again (which seems to imply that it is no longer great, and was it ever?).This manipulation of reality and voters through addressing the feeling of need would probably ruffle Ms Rand‚Äôs fur a bit, I think. She might find him interesting as a caricature of a business man (for he is nothing more that a caricature), but I doubt she would equate him with Galt, or any of Galt‚Äôs chosen ones."
866,"If this is about mac and cheese, gruyere is kind of the king of melted cheese foods. It melts evenly and doesn't completely turn into grease. It's not as creamy as havarti and is definitely more cheesy tasting, but still pretty mild for a semi-hard cheese. For flavor comparable to havarti, maybe a super mild cheddar or Gouda or, honestly, a white American cheese could fit the bill as long as whomever you're cooking for isn't too snobby to eat American cheese."

In this case your heart may not work well and you may get dizzy.If your blood flow to your gut is not good or there are other inflammatory issues in the bowel causing blood loss you may get dizzy. If you are not moving around you may get constipated and you may get dizzy when you stand suddenly due to postural hypotension, but the constipation is not causing the dizziness.Of course some people have died or passed out when they have made a vagal maneuver trying to push out a hard stool. But that is a nerve stimulation that causes that issue."

The dual-dynamic driver retains the mid and bass tones mellow and is made out of graphene substance that pushes out sounds with fuller and fuller details.The balanced armature driver keeps the rich details of the high notes to the primary melody, which means you get to experience tri-band equalization effect.Now it seems almost like you are close to nature, with the all-new Mi In-Ear Headphones Pro HD.To achieve a balance in the bass, mid, and high sound ranges, we included dual balanced and dynamic drivers with our all-new Mi In-Ear Headphones Pro HD. The bigger dynamic driver is responsible for the reduced sound ranges, whereas the smaller dynamic driver takes care of the higher sound rangesHeadphone fans will always encourage you to ditch bundled earphones whenever possible.We are inclined to agree, but it is as much as a societal issue as a sound quality. Naff little earbuds have a tendency to flow sound like water pouring through a sieve, sure to royally irritate anybody nearby.Not so with sound isolating buds such as the RHA MA-350.Not only do the MA-350 earphones block your ear canals off from the unwanted sound with rubber tips, their bodies are completely enclosed also.Made from machined aluminum, the sole outlet for noise is the driver grille, which can be made from metal. This sort of build quality is unheard of at this price point.And yes, we attempted treading on the MA-350 -- they survived.The RHA MA-350 earphones utilize a fabric-covered cable. This is an effort to decrease tangling, but in our experience cloth wires have a tendency to tangle quite as much as their plastic/rubber counterparts."

870,"Thrilled. This word means ‚Äúto have a sudden feeling of excitement‚Äù. Complicated!!Well, I think by thrilled you mean you want to see a movie that will have a huge impact on you, and which will make you think about your believes. A movie which would just stun you.So here's my list.Interstellar by Christopher Nolan. (Off course it's the best)The Dark Knight Trilogy by Christopher Nolan. (No doubts)Inception by Christopher Nolan. (May be you are still dreaming!!)The Prestige by Christopher Nolan. (Epic, just Epic)Forrest Gump. (I don't know what's so good about this one, but it deserves to be here)Now you see me. (This one would surely fullfill your desire to be thrilled. And it also has a sequel, Woohoo)The Lone Ranger. (This one has both thrill factor and an epic story)Ok. So you may be thinking that I am a big fan of Christopher Nolan, and yup I am, but just watch any one of his movies, you will understand why his name came so many times.I actually find Harry Potter too much thrilling, but the books are far better than the movies, so you should read the books. Movies are nothing compared to the books.Edit:I don't know why I forgot this one!Edge of Tomorrow. (Confusing little bit, but very thrilling)Ok, so I have not seen this one. But it's got 8.8/10 on IMDb. So it should be good. FIGHT CLUB by David Fincher.Edit: Ok I saw Fight Club, and it was 1 am when I saw it, and the movie was so good that I was not able to sleep for next two hours!!"

872,"Foremost thing that matters in clearing any competitive exam is the approach and direction. This is further dependent on the Faculty, Study Material, Mentoring and other important factors.Many of us get into some institutes where a lot of students have already given there attempts 3‚Äì4 times or batch strength is more than 30. A beginner can never understand and start from the concepts in these kind of classes. Also, some institutes hire inexperienced faculty and do injustice to their students.I would suggest look for an institute where initially you can attend free demo classes(more than 1), Study material should be updated, faculty who is expert in their subjects like Quant, LR, GS or English, and provide updated testing environment.I have a keen interest in guiding aspirants for govt. jobs and other fields too. I researched about various institutions in Chandigarh by visiting and attending demo classes. I found some are really good in teaching but batch sizes are 30+, some have good material and testing but faculty is inexperienced.There was one institute in Sector 34-A named ‚ÄúMy Career‚Äù. They have started the institute afresh in Chandigarh although have quite well-reputed center in Bathinda (as some sources told me from the city). Main benefit is it is run by IIM Alumni and very experienced faculty who have actually taught students for MBA. Study material is also fine. Major plus point here would be that they have started in the city, so they are really working hard to give good results and provide good coaching & training to students and hence excel in the league. So, after all research and counsel, I would recommend My Career Institute to all for SSC and Banking Coaching. You guys can atleast visit and attend demo classes there. All the Best !! :)"

874,"Going Christmas caroling.Last year my friends and I decided that we wanted to do something different for Halloween.I had heard the idea from another answer on Quora, and decided to give it a try. Our school was doing a holiday food drive, and we decided to give our shenanigans a philanthropic twist. We all dressed in our winter coats, scarves and santa hats, and set off to sing.My friends consist mainly of band kids with a smattering of chior so we weren't bad at singing, just not great. At every house we would wait for them to open the door then launch into our song. When we finished and they offered candy we politely asked for canned food donations instead.In about an hour of caroling, we collected four large shopping bags of food. We delivered it to the school for the food drive the next day.In the end, everyone had a blast and we got some good donations to a charitable cause, so it was a double win.I highly recommend Christmas caroling this Halloween!"
875,"This is the most detailed answer I have ever written. If anyone read this he shall be able to trade I feel. I am putting all of my knowledge here that I have gainedI am going to brief you about basic terms like what is Demat account, What is depository, how to place a buy sell on a terminal. What are different types of orders, what if you want to hold your position or want automatic exit in intraday and what is leverage and margin so you don‚Äôt have to ask separately. If you have questions like How to select an stock or trade in Options visit Daily Capital Market Dose for It.Well, the first step, talking in India you need a demat account. Now what is that: its an account that holds all the shares that you purchase in electronic or dematerialized form. Basically, a demat account is to your shares what a bank account is to your money. Like the bank account, a demat account holds the certificates of your financial instruments like shares, bonds, government securities, mutual funds and exchange traded funds (ETFs).Now with that definition, let me elaborate you need a demat account only if you are willing to deal in Shares that too taking the delivery or holding the shares for T+1 day. If you want to invest in other than stock market you need a demat. BUT if you are planning only intraday or day trading; you don‚Äôt need a demat account. YOU NEED ONLY TRADING ACCOUNT.Role of Demat account:NOW WHAT IS DEPOSITORY &amp; ITS FUNCTIONS:A depository is similar to a bank. It holds shares, which belong to investors, in electronic form. The investor has to open an account with the depository, through a Depository Participant (Broker). The broker is an intermediary between the depository and the investor. In India, there are two depositories, National Securities Depository and Central Depository Services. A number of banks (HDFC Bank, ICICI Bank, SBI, and so on) , brokers ( Zerodha, India Infoline, Motilal Oswal and Indiabulls) and institutions function as DPs.How to open a demat account?Choose a broker on parameters: brokerage charges, annual charges and leverage provided. Fill up a form, submit documents like PAN CARD, CANCEL CHEQUE, ID PROOF, INCOME PROOF (BANK STATEMENT OR ITR) AND INVESTMENT OR MARGIN CHEQUE.NOW WHAT IS MARGIN AND LEVERAGE?Margin is your investment amount that you are investing and leverage is the limit you get on it. Lets say you have 10,000/- to invest that is your margin and leverage is limit that broker provides for trading. Like if he gives you 4 times limit that means you can make a trade where you will need a margin of 40,000/-Why? Because broker make commission on turnover more turnover you make in buy and sell more profit he makes.Now once your demat is open now you get a trading terminal. What is trading terminal? Well its an software that enables you to go online access the Exchange and make a trade in it. You can buy and sell via that terminal. If you are not comfortable online trading, ask your broker to provide you offline trading number. One that number you can share your credentials and ask the person to put the trade on your behalf.This depends on broker to broker but I have a Zerodha account I am explaining you the complete process with them.After account opening, two emails are sent:Welcome emailPassword emailWelcome email contains login and password details to Q, our reporting tool. Q contains all historical reports, tax P&amp;L, ledger, fund withdrawal requests, historical holdings/positions table, trade and P&amp;L visualizations (quant reports) to help improve trading performance and more.Password email contains the trading/Kite user ID, and the first time login password. A prompt to change this while logging into Kite for the first time will be made.Kite is Zerodha trading terminal just like Angel Broking has Angel Eye, Kotak Securities have KEAT, ShareKhan has TRADETIGER.Now trading online: You ne..."
876,"Bonus IssueA bonus issue is a stock dividend, allotted by the company to reward the shareholders. The bonus shares are issued out of the reserves of the company. These are free shares that the shareholders receive against shares that they currently hold. These allotments typically come in a fixed ratio such as, 1:1, 2:1, 3:1 etc.If the ratio is 2:1 ratio, the existing shareholders get 2 additional shares for every 1 share they hold at no additional cost. So if a shareholder owns 100 shares then he will be issued an additional 200 shares, so his total holding will become 300 shares. When the bonus shares are issued, the number of shares the shareholder holds will increase but the overall value of investment will remain the same.Companies issue bonus shares to encourage retail participation, especially when the price per share of a company is very high and it becomes tough for new investors to buy shares. By issuing bonus shares, the number of outstanding shares increases, but the value of each share reduces.In your case you will get 33 shares from the company.HAPPY TRADING‚Ä¶"
877,"I think it‚Äôs important to understand some basics about black money before judging this giant decision by the government.When we hear ‚ÄòBlack money‚Äô what most of us imagine is this:And conclude that this is ‚Äòevil‚Äô or ‚Äòbad‚Äô and hence must be cleaned up. And that is all there is to ‚ÄòBlack money‚Äô.The truth is this hoard of cash might be completely legitimate, even if it hidden under a bed - if it has been disclosed to the government and taxes have been paid for it. Then it is white moneyMoney = Cash?I might store all my money(black or white) in bank deposits, or in the form of cash at home - if that makes me happy. I might use it for charitable purposes or to throw a booze party or for a lavish wedding. That‚Äôs my right.Money can take the form of cash, real estate, gold or whatever.The only question which makes it black or white is: Have the requisite taxes been paid?If taxes are not paid, then it becomes black money. Now I need to hide this money. Surely bank deposits are not a good idea! If I buy something using this money I need to hide that too. So I buy big things in somebody else‚Äôs name(benami transactions), stash it in offshore accounts(which promise secrecy), invest in real estate(by showing lesser value) etc.Note that the cash component is a small part of the total money - especially If I have huge amounts of black money. It is simply impractical to hoard it all in cash.So ‚Äòmoney‚Äô is NOT the same as CashSo when we say our stated aim is ‚ÄòTo curb black money‚Äô we are not just hunting for hoards of cash. We are not even hunting for people with lots of real estate, or politicians who have a lot of gold. People can legitimately hold on to all that.We are hunting for hoards of cash, or people with lots of real estate, or politicians who have a lot of gold - who have not paid the taxes on it. And then collect those taxes. And perhaps impose heave penalties to prevent recurrence.But even this catches existing black money. The real solution is to make everybody pay taxes. But maybe catching existing black cash is also a good first step‚Ä¶So let‚Äôs analyse how useful this step is.Coming to demonetisation, two things to understand:It directly affects only the cash component of money. Not the real estate, gold etc. that I have. And that too, the part that is in form of 500 or 1000 notes.It affects black and white cash. You and me had white money but still were forced to deposit it in banks.So to judge effectiveness of the demonetisation scheme, we should try to calculate how much of the money is in CASH, and is black, and will be collected - and compare it against the total black money.A - Domestic black money‚ÄúAs Schneider estimates, using the dynamic multiple-indicators multiple-causes method and by currency demand method, that the size of India's black money economy is between 23 and 26%‚ÄùSource: Indian black money - WikipediaLet us assume it is 25%‚ÄúThe Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in India was worth 2073.54 billion US dollars in 2015‚ÄùSource: India GDPThis translates to 141 Lakh crores. 25% of this is about 35 Lakh crores.B - Offshore black money‚ÄúIn March 2012, the government of India clarified in its parliament that the CBI director's statement on $500 billion of illegal money[in foreign tax havens] was an estimate based on a statement made to India's Supreme Court in July 2011‚Äù Source: Indian black money - WikipediaThis translates to about 34 Lakh croresTotal black money = A + B = 35 + 34 = 69 Lakh croresThe question now is: How much of this black money is in cash and circulating inside India in form of 500 and 1000 Rs notes, which the demonetisation scheme might recover?C - Total currency in 500 and 1000 Rs. notes = 14 Lakh crores‚Äúthe annual report of Reserve Bank of India (RBI) of 31 March 2016 stated that total bank notes in circulation valued to ‚Çπ16.42 lakh crore (US$240 billion) of which nearly 86% (around ‚Çπ14.18 lakh cror..."
878,"A2A.Well, a group discussion is technically a discussion. So, there's no point in people arguing without letting anyone speak. But that is what happens almost every time because most of the time, your job is on the line.Infact, even though people have no point to speak, then too they will jump in the argument and soon it will become a fish market. Most of the time the groups will be very big with as much as 25 people in a group and the time given will be mere 15 mins max. So, it's very difficult to keep your point forward.I have been part of many GDs and I have done reasonably well in all of them. So, I will just share my experience.Indian army selection in campus - My first GD for a job. 22 people were in a single group. The topic was a very general one. After two people spoke, everyone started jumping in. Soon, nothing was audible but still the GD was going on. I was pissed off with all the noise, so I shouted, ‚ÄúEK MINUTE‚Äù (one minute!). It was kind of an involuntary action. My voice was very loud and everyone literally stopped and they were staring at me. I went ahead and spoke for half a minute. I didn't know whether what I did was correct or not but certainly I had an impact. Result - selected.Indian army in ssb - I had a series of GDs here, as much as 5 if I remember. The first one was the most tricky one because there were 22 people in a group. Again everyone started arguing with only 5 to 6 people shouting at peak of their voices and others keeping quiet. One of the fellow member who was sitting right beside me was literally shouting. Again, involuntarily, I shouted in an even bold voice and told him to let others speak. Probably, not the wisest thing I would have done but it had its effect. He kept quiet and others, including me were able to speak. Result - selected.BPCL GD - 16 people were in my group and again (sigh!) same thing happened. Only 4 people out of 16 were speaking in a very loud voice. I was one of them (:P). But as soon as I was seeing people other than these 3 speak, I was stopping for them to complete. Others were not doing the same and one of them got rejected for this very reason. Result - selected.So, I think the most important thing is how bold your voice is. No one is going to help you in this. You have to grab your chances and speak. One thing you can do is prepare for what you are going to speak when others are shouting. Then with confidence go for the chance. Also, make sure that you are not overdoing this. Give others chance to speak. The assessors wants to see two main things - your communication skills and leadership skills. Also make sure you listen carefully when someone speaks or at least pretend to do so.Read my other answers for other things you can do in GD.Good luck!"

883,"Well, we did actually raise three daughters in Mexico, between 1991 and 2011, 20 years! And yes, the education system in Mexico is, diplomatically expressed, really hard to manage for parents.According to the Constitution, in Mexico Education is supposed to belaicistic, meaning religion has no influence over it and no religious topics are taught.mandatory, meaning no child should go without itfree of charge, meaning, well, no money is charged to parents.They do a pretty good job with the laicism thing. No religious doctrine, no religious signs in classrooms, etc. I always could live with this as do most Mexicans. We can live our faith in the Church and at home.Mandatory, well, it‚Äôs on the law books but it is not the only law in Mexico getting ignored, so do not get surprised when you see kids in the street selling stuff in school hours. They might go to evening classes!Free of charge? No way. You as the parents must pay the ‚Äúcuota‚Äù! School principals have found a way to charge parents ‚Äúa voluntary contribution‚Äù and then you can only buy the mandatory school uniform at authorized dealers (family of a teacher or principal) And for every little holiday on the calender there is a collection for candies and cake, with a kickpack to each teacher. And then the inscription fee. And you must contribute with cleaning supplies and toilet paper. All these fees are supposedly for improving the installations, but most of it disappears in the wallets of the teaching staff. Kids learn an important lesson, though. ‚ÄúQuien no tranza no avanza‚Äù meaning if you do not cheat you do not get anywhere. In a strange way of coincidence, the drug cartel members call their extortion ‚Äúcuota‚Äù as well. A lesson well learned!‚ÄúBonnie and Clyde‚Äù (my wife an myself) tried to get people raising their voices against this injustice, the amounts can be as high as a monthly salary of a minimum wage worker. But people prefer to not eat and let go their water bills unpaid in order to pay the school. Out of fear of retaliation from the teachers against their kids. After a few years of windmill fighting we finally gave in and took them to private school. My wife got herself a bitter foe in the school principal, when she would oversee the spending of the funds and no kickbacks got paid out for 2 years to school staff.There are more hoops to jump through when having kids in Mexico!Registring your offspring at the civil registry so they can have a birth certificate and a passport later on. You will stand in line, babies bundled up in several blankets, at 4 A.M in line at the office - which opens like at 9. Otherwise you will get denied access and you have to come back. If you wait 6 months or longer, you will run into trouble for late registry, and your kid will have lifelong troubles for it when asking for a passport (I know, because our second born was registered late)And you better marry a woman whose immune system is compatible with yours. (If you are smart you do, because you WILL find her magically attractive according to some investigation!) Then, your sexlife is great and your kids get never sick. Because the public health system in Mexico is understaffed and underfunded. But they do a good job at vaccinating - and can you believe it? No lines! We did go with those few ailments that came through the super duper immune system of the girls to a private clinic. You pay, but the service is very good. And payment was reasonable.Sounds like a lot of hassles and I should have had the kids in Switzerland?Hell no!In Switzerland, Schools are free of charge. But also a bully‚Äôs paradise! For we Swiss are too whimpy to deal with it. In Mexico, I am glad to say that this was not tolerated. You be a bully - you are out! For good.And there are lots of other advantages of raising kids in Mexico. If such a question pops up, I will go much longer on it!"
884,"I think a lot of these answers miss the point of the question. The real issue isn't that there's a paucity of useful webpages on the internet, it's that taking advantage of those webpages is difficult. What does it say about human beings that we really can get an Ivy League education for free online but nearly nobody does it? The Coursera and Udacity and Khan Academy attrition rates are so phenomenal that it makes the completion rates look like round-off errors. We live in an attention-deficit culture, and the solution isn't better websites, it's better humans.In view of spending your time more effectively, I suggest the following tips:Completely cut Facebook, Reddit, Twitter, and any other social sites out of your life. If you are unable to do this, strictly regulate the total time spent on these sites to 30 minutes to an hour each day. You can download Chrome extensions to help you with this like StayFocusd. But, I cannot emphasize enough how much these sites will ruin your life. Everyone always comes to the defense of social media with excuses like, ""well, I use Facebook to keep in touch with my high school friends and relatives overseas,"" or ""Twitter is how I stay up-to-date with current events,"" or ""you can learn lots of great things with specialized subreddits,"" and so on. Yet when you look at a distribution of how people actually allocate their time, nearly none of it is spent doing the very things that people point to when they justify their behavior. It's always just mindless scrolling, animated gifs, cat videos, the first twenty seconds of a really neat lecture, and so on.What could be a more devastating rebuke of social media than the fact that nobody uses it for the reasons it was designed? This is, of course, auxiliary to the more important reality that research on Facebook consistently shows that it makes everyone more sad and less fulfilled with life on average.Practice efficient procrastination. If you need time to recharge in between difficult activities, find outlets in which you can still develop yourself as a person. For me, that's chess. I'll play a couple games of Blitz in between projects to recharge, and, more importantly, I'm not watching cat videos. For other people it might be practicing an instrument, or reading a book, or drawing.To-do lists. There may be nothing more insanely effective than a to-do list. Write down what you have to do, prioritize the list by difficulty, and be excruciatingly detailed when you write down your objectives. Don't get fancy, don't use Evernote or a Chrome Extension, or some app, just use paper and pen. Don't write ""Finish research paper on ethics."" Write ""Write one page on Chapter 3 of Peter Singer's 'Practical Ethics."" The smaller, more discrete the tasks, the more superable they become. Also plan how you are going to efficiently procrastinate in between the tasks. Write ""play chess"", ""watch a Noam Chomsky lecture"", ""do one lesson of DuoLingo,"" and so forth in between big tasks. Take a power nap if you're too exhausted to be efficient with your procrastination. Remember: when you don't plan your time, you fail to take advantage of opportunities that avail themselves, and you go for the path of least resistance -- which usually happens to be AngryBirds and YouTube videos.Who cares? This is perhaps the most important point. Next time you are about to post something to Facebook, or watch a funny video, or read a blog post, or get involved in an internet argument, ask yourself: Who cares?  If something isn't helping you to become a better you, don't waste your time. Today I read a BuzzFeed article on ""Epic Twitter Comebacks."" I was baited into reading the article by the outrageous title, and subsequently became angry at myself for finishing it. The article just didn't matter. Nothing productive could possibly come from reading or writing it. The most popular articles shared anywhere -- Facebook, Buzzfeed, and the countless copycat sites-- are the journalistic equivalent of McDonald's. Consuming them makes everybody worse off.I have found myself knee-deep in an hour long compilation of Vines, and twenty minutes in, I have to do a reality check: This shit literally does not matter. The world would be a better place if all of it just disappeared. What possible value could there be spending all your time mindlessly consuming 7 second videos for hours at a time? It doesn't make you happier, it doesn't leave a lasting feeling of satisfaction; it is just raw, unproductive consumption.Now step back, and think of all the countless hours spent in front of screens, convincing yourself that it's just one more video, or just one more picture, just one more.. and then remember that this is your life. How we spend our days is how we spend our lives. This is it, this is all we have; you are the aggregate of your experiences. Do you want the average of those experiences to be summarized by a few URLs, a couple videos, and some half-hearted commitments to better yourself? So be vigilant! When you find yourself immersed in mindless consumption, ask yourself: ""Who cares?"" If what you're doing right isn't helping you become a better you, do something else."

886,"I made my own list about things that are not socially acceptable. Well, at least in many societies‚Ä¶ I wish these things were socially acceptable:MEN WHO CRYI hate ‚Äòreal men don't cry‚Äô word. Men are also human, and humans cry sometimes.GOING TO CINEMA ALONEWe don‚Äôt need a friend or boyfriend/girlfriend to watch the movie we want. We watch movies alone at home, so why not in a cinema.REPEATING THE SAME OUTFITIf we really love an outfit, why shouldn‚Äôt we wear it multiple times in a week? Many people, especially women still think too much about what to wear every day.We should just prefer our favorite one again if we want to wear it. Kate Middleton repeats many looks again and again. And she looks classy all the time.the source:[1]OLDER WOMAN-YOUNGER MAN RELATIONSHIPWhen men are older, it is not that problem. But when women are older, our society reacts that situation and talk about their relationship in many rude ways. It is totally OK if they are both adults. And it is nobody‚Äôs business. Older women-younger men relationships should also be socially acceptable.BEING A GAMER GIRL/WOMANI am also a woman gamer. And many people surprise when they realize that I am a woman who beat them on video games. And a lot of people show negative reactions to woman/girl gamers. I don‚Äôt like when people try to set gender rules on video games. Women also deserve to play video games. So, it should be socially acceptable.WEARING FLIP-FLOPS ALMOST EVERWHEREFlip-flops are freedom! I personally wear them a lot of times in summers. I am a Turk who live in Turkey. When I am in ƒ∞zmir, it is ok because there are also people who wear flip flops daily, but when I visit other cities of Turkey, for example, ƒ∞stanbul or Eski≈üehir, people look at my feet and then my face and they probably think that I am a tourist because of my flip-flops.But I keep wearing it, and I also suggest you wear it. Do not care if people think you look like a tourist or not. Enjoy it. They are comfortable.MEN WHO WEAR SKIRTS/DRESS/CAFTANEven if it is in many cultures, there is still a social bias about skirt/dress wearing men.WOMEN SHOULD BE SEXUALLY PURE, AND GET DRESSED PROPERLYIt is another social problem which depends on sexism in our society. I really hate sexism, so every sexist social norm annoys me a lot.Women‚Äôs sexuality is controlled through slut shaming. Many men would still be uncomfortable being with a woman who had slept with many more people than he had ‚Äì and many men still feel comfortable referring to women as ‚Äúslags‚Äù or ‚Äúsluts‚Äù for indulging in behavior that would make a man a ‚Äústud‚Äù or a ‚Äúlad‚Äù.[2]And many of our societies are still judge women about their clothes.the source:[3]NAPING EVERYWHERE YOU WANTIf you take a nap outside and carry your wallet and phone with you, it is a risk, I know.

887,"The trick with any of the shows like this is what you think it's about isn't necessarily what it's about. While the characters are scientists, the plots are rarely about the science itself, they're still just character studies.The individual characters each have their own audience that works well for the show. Leonard, who I would call the ""star"" (yes, above Sheldon), is definitely the most self-aware of the characters and the first draw for the audience. He's the ""geek that wants to be a normal boy"", but he's never embarrassed about his knowledge. There are many more people (that is most) who feel like perpetual outsiders so this creates a relatable character.Sheldon's character is interesting because it's a type of person who is simultaneously a genius yet we in the audience can sometimes feel superior to because we ""get"" things he doesn't where human behavior is concerned. There are many parallels between his character, and Dick Solomon (John Lithgow) on 3rd Rock From the Sun. (In fact, this would be a good college essay). They're both incredibly intelligent people who are baffled by the inconsistencies and rules of society behavior. Their brilliant logic fails them because people aren't logical, and as an audience, we find humor in having stupid inconsistent things pointed out. (Standup comics everywhere know this, that's their bread-and-butter. Is there a difference between Sheldon questioning a dating ritual and Jerry Sienfled asking ""why is there a slot for used razor blades in an airplane bathroom? Who's shaving in there, and going through so many they have to dispose of them?"")Penny is our entry point, she's us as the audience, and we see things through her eyes. Howard and Raj are (were) the Lenny and Squiggy of TBBT, more comic relief in the beginning though now much stronger characters in their own right as they were developed in later seasons. Beyond the characters, some of the success is just because Geek Culture is just part of the cultural fabric now. Once Comic-Con went mainstream, that was a big shift that geeky was celebrated instead of a target for ridicule. We have ""celebrity CEOs"" like the late Steve Jobs and Mark Zuckerberg who are technical, not sports stars, and it's allowed smart people to not necessarily have to be closeted about it.But at the end of the day, it's the characters relating to each other that brings us in. Star Trek was always at it's most successful when it used the science and the space travel as a backdrop for fundamentally emotional stories (this applies to both the series and the movies). The more ""technical they got"" (where the plot was no longer about ""where is this guy hiding and can we find him""¬† -- but whether they ""could fix the gamma ray in time to output 50 megarems of hydrotonium¬† to collapse the star so the neighboring galaxy would ---"" ugh), most audiences just gave up and bailed at that point. As long as Big Bang focuses on the human, it will be relatable to a wide audience."

889,"I actually got fired fairly recently. I was working for a company in Atlanta, programming sensitive measuring devices for quality inspections. In 2015, the company hired a new supervisor, who was simply a terrible person to work with. She and I did not get along and, the first chance she got, she fired me. Luckily for me, I was also doing contract work on the side, and one of the company's I was consulting hired me fulltime before the week was out. I was only unemployed for three days.Unlucky for my previous employer, there was no one in the organization who could do my job. My former boss was so detached that she didn't even realize this until after I was gone. About two weeks later, the entire department had come to a screeching stop, and they actually called and asked if I wanted to return to work. They might have been a little hasty in their decision, they said. They had done a little soul searching, and were willing to let me come back on a ‚Äúprobationary‚Äù basis.Well, I was able to tell them thanks but no thanks. I already had another job making more money.A few more days went by, and they called me yet again, and asked if I could, at least, come back and train someone. HR actually insinuated that I had, somehow, treated the company unfairly.I told them I would be more than happy to come back and train someone‚Ä¶ for 50 bucks an hour, that is.Hell no. That was highway robbery; they simply wouldn't pay it.‚ÄúSuit yourself.‚Äù I replied.Another week went by, and work continued to pile up. They were still trying to find someone to help them out, but things were going very slowly. By the middle of the week, they called me back, and agreed to my terms. However, by this time, I just wanted to be an ass, so I told them that my price had gone up. I was now charging 75 an hour for training.Of course this went over like a concrete balloon, and they told me that they weren't going to be exploited by a former employee.‚ÄúFine by me,‚Äù I replied. ‚ÄúBut don't call me again.‚ÄùWell, this time they didn't call back. Instead they contacted the manufacturer, and had them send in a Tech to train a few people.What did he charge them?I heard through the grapevine that it was around 5000 a week and, by my calculations, my dismissal ended up costing the company around 30,000 dollars. At least that‚Äôs been the tally so far.Man‚Ä¶ they REALLY showed me.LOL."

892,"I strongly disagree with most of the answers here. Don‚Äôt let ‚Äúso called economists‚Äù mislead you who says after demonetization of 500/1000 rupees notes, the real estate sector will go down, without correcting your facts.People are claiming that real estate industry involves the maximum amount of black money, and as there will be shortage of black money after government‚Äôs bold decision, the demand for the properties will reduce. And as the demand supply graph works, lower demand means lower prices. The thing you are missing here is, real estate sector is not just about black money and pricing system in an industry is not just about demand and supply relation.We can divide this industry in majorly two parts to understand the effects of currency ban:1. Agriculture land and individual plots: These are the two types of properties which might see the downfall.These properties are generally bought long back with a very lesser amount compared to the present rates, so the prices of these two types of properties are completely depended on the market value. So if the market value of any property decreases, automatically the price of that property will decrease. Now since these properties involve the maximum amount of black money, shortage of black money will reduce the number of potential buyers from market, reducing market value, finally reducing the prices.2. All the other type of properties (Commercial office spaces, apartments, developer plots, villas etc.)These types of properties involve negligible or no black money. So the reduction of black money will have minimum effect on the demand of these types of properties.Secondly prices of these are not just depended on the market demand. A huge amount is first invested by builders to develop the property. So in these cases margins on invested amount plays a major role in deciding the property‚Äôs price. Since the real estate market has already been witnessing recession since last 3 years, builders have reduced their margins to the lowest. So there is no further scope of price reductions as no businessman will sell his product with a loss. The prices may stay still, but will not see downfall for sure.The mentioned points are the cases when the demand stays the same as before or goes down. But we should notice here that since the banks will be flooded with cash after government‚Äôs decision of demonetization of 500/1000 rupees notes, the loan process will be eased and the interest rates will be reduced. These properties were already being transacted without any black money, and now since there would be easy home loans at lower interest rates, demand of these properties might even INCREASE.So guys please correct your facts and stop believing everything you read. This time is the best time to buy property. The prices may not go up in a short span, but these will not go down for sure."
893,"IIM Shillong Interview : 2017This was one unique question I faced since it was no where related to management (in an IIM interview). The reason being, I discussed about administrative services in CD (Case based GD as well).Panel members : P Candidate : SP : Sandeep, you brought in a point about administration & you said you are a logical thinker as well. Let me put you in a situation.S : Okay sir .P : You are the collector of a big unit like Lucknow. At morning 4 am, you receive a call that there has been a bus accident and some people are killed as well as injured. Just when you were about to leave , you receive another phone call that some drunk people (about 6‚Äì7) are drowning in the river. When you were just deciding what to do next, you receive third call saying that nearest biggest cinema hall has caught fire, it‚Äôs almost like a pride for the city of Lucknow. You have just 1 minute to decide. What will be your plan of action?(I like puzzles. Every puzzle has some catch. For me, the catch here is he never really mentioned about any victims in the cinema hall. That was my Eureka moment ! )S : Sir, my least priority would be the cinema hall. Since it‚Äôs 4am in the morning, it should be safe to assume there were no movies being played and it should be empty. Hence, my presence won‚Äôt change anything. I would dispatch fire emergency services there. Second would be the river drowning. Even if I go there, I don‚Äôt know swimming and hence won‚Äôt be of much value there. Hence I would send river search operation teams and be in touch with local authorities there. My highest priority would be bus accident since there would be a lot of chaos there. In case of deaths, people block roads which affect the general transport system. Hence the loss would be much higher here.P : What if I say the cinema hall belonged to the most important politician of your state?S : Then, he himself would ensure everything since he would be more desperate to save his property. It‚Äôs not even a concern for me then!Panel members laughing ! Verdict : ConvertedConclusion : In puzzles , devil lies in the details. Since I was very much cool about the interview (not much interested for IIMS) and he warned me that he is going to give a puzzle. I listened to his pointers carefully. That really helped !

894,"I'm sitting here trying to puzzle out how to say this. I think that one is vulnerable when young and hormones are going crazy. That is when we fall passionately in love and are unable to assess other people's motives clearly. This gets easier as you get older.

896,"Human vaccine is quite a bit more expensive, I believe.I asked my vet why dog rabies vaccine is so inexpensive compared to human vaccine, which I don‚Äôt recall her answering. I also asked what would happen if humans were injected with the vaccine prepared for canines and she gave me a complicated answer about how the dead virus is mixed with stuff that is either good for stirring up the human immune response, or it is mixed with the stuff that is good for stirring up canine, feline, or other immune systems. Dog vaccine wouldn‚Äôt be very effective when used on humans, so you wouldn‚Äôt get the immunity you hoped for, and the same would apply if you tried to use human vaccine on a dog.So, simplistically viewed, they should be the same (although I think the quality control requirements for human vaccine are much more stringent), but when everything is sorted out it turns out that can‚Äôt be substituted.You‚Äôre going to pay so much for human vaccine I don‚Äôt know why anybody would even want to try it. The vaccine for dogs and horses is about $2.50/vial. (You can buy it, but it won‚Äôt meet strict state requirements for animal vaccinations.) The CDC says humans should expect to pay $3000 for a full course of treatment after suffering a bite. So the human stuff costs at least 100 times as much, and yet it would not be tailored for canine immune systems.I‚Äôm neither a vet nor an MD so don‚Äôt take anything I say as medical advice. Human treatment always requires a visit to an MD, and canine administration should be done by a vet or you have to take all the responsibility on yourself if you do something the wrong way or there are other unwanted results. It‚Äôs better to pay a $25 fee at a pet shop vaccine clinic and be safe for yourself and for your pet."

(There lies a beautiful thing called Time constraint.) Target study. Smart Study.Hope following points helpSplit Every Chapter of Every Subject so as to fix daily targets. Reward yourself with an episode of F.R.I.E.N.D.S (or anything you like).Split chapters such that you complete at least 3 revisions of LAW, 2 revisions of Macro Economics, Concepts of Micro Economics, QA and accounts thoroughly covered.Ain‚Äôt no using bed for studies. (Paper would be conducted in classroom, right ?)Before starting theory subject, solve 2 to 3 practical questions. Proceed to theory subject. This will build the flow of study. (Since I find difficulty starting to study theory subjects first)Stick your marks target in front of your study table.Be confident.Use 3 star method (Based on individuals understanding level)1 * - Check it for once and never look again. 100% clear.2 * - Need to see twice. Moderate.3 * - Need to see thrice. Priority !Solve at least 3 sample questions papers before going for exam.Check for additions in Macro Economics syllabus. There may be some slight additions. It surely fetches a mark or two. (I got to know about this from a guy from Delhi who uploaded a revision lecture for Ma Eco)Make mnemonics to remember dates and certain names.Do not study for straight hours. Take breaks.

906,"Based on the question, I will presume that you 1) have never made a game and 2) do not know how to write code... which is fine - ultimately that is where everyone starts.TL;DR: I think your best choice today is C# within the Unity3D engine.Build your game, not a game engineI am a strong advocate of ""learning by doing"" instead of ""learning a variety of prerequisite skills related to what you want to do"" and then attempting your project afterwards.¬† If we're talking about nuclear science then it would be a different story, but game development is at its best when its iterative and interactive.Building a game from scratch is Hard.¬† If you are starting out today, then there is no good reason to do it.¬† There are a number of free game engines available today that are well suited to beginners and hobbyists.¬† If you were really interested in building vector math libraries, audio drivers or animation subsystems, then I suspect you would have asked a different question.Focus on C-based languagesThe majority of games are written in some dialect of C (C,C++,C#,Objective C).¬† Java (Android and PC) and Actionscript (Flash/web) have a non-trivial share, but C is still the king.The first few generations of game consoles were mostly straight C (and Assembly/machine code) for performance reasons.C++ became an increasing wedge in the early 2000's and is now the predominant language of PC/console games.Objective C is an Apple variant of C which is similar to C++ but is the native language of iOS.C# was developed by Microsoft as a Java alternative.¬† It was originally used for making windows programs and tools, but has recently gained popularity for games.I would recommend C# because it handles memory management and garbage collection (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mem..., http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gar...) for you.¬† What are those?¬† Complicated problems that aren't the interesting part of making games.¬† It's kinda like having a Tax Accountant.¬† With that said ... once you learn the basic concepts behind programming it becomes easier to learn new languages - and each new language is easier than the last - so the most important thing is to just start somewhere, anywhere that you can get a foothold.Try Unity UNITY: Game Development ToolI recommend Unity so much these days that I really should start asking for a cut.¬† In all seriousness it is a great, free toolkit that lets you work at progressive degrees of abstraction, has an active community with lots of component parts that you can pull into your projects.¬† It also lets you target mobile, web, PC and consoles without having to make big hard choices up front.Most importantly, it has enough built in that you can drag and drop components, write a little bit of code and see immediate results.¬† It's a great platform to learn as you go and there are lots of tutorials that help you learn the programming concepts along the way."

910,"Irritation, anger or any other emotion has some reason behind it. It may not be an immediate cause, maybe something long ago which we can‚Äôt even think of right now. But its always linked to something or the other. Sometimes its because things are not going on as per our plan or people are not behaving as per our expectations. At times it is also because we are not behaving or acting the way we should.Our brain might also get linked to some specific emotion at some specific situation. This is known as conditioned stimulus. For instance, during my childhood, I could hear the voice of evening prayers from a nearby religious place only when i was alone at home. At other times, when there was someone, people kept talking and i didn‚Äôt notice that sound. Gradually, as I grew up whenever I heard that sound, I started feeling lonely. I noticed this only a few years ago. Though there is no reason for this emotion, but it got linked to a certain situation.Hormonal imbalances in people also lead to extremes of emotions, but that is an exception more than a norm.But I think a person should focus on gradually overcoming these emotions so that they don‚Äôt bother you anymore. I am not asking you to fake that you are perfectly normal and not at all concerned. Rather, try to find a logic. If some situation or person is not acting as per your expectation, then you need to realize that its not possible to have everything according to you. Either change the situation or change yourself. First be aware of your emotions, consciously withdraw yourself from the situation and then try to manage them. Gradually you will learn to manage them.As far as what I have learned from my life, these negative emotions harm only the person who has them. If another person is the cause of it then he may not even be aware of it, let alone be affected by it. Things like meditation, sports, yoga,etc might help as well. It helps to moderate your instincts and hence helps in overcoming negative emotions. Anyways, every emotion is some ‚Äòchemical locha‚Äô in the brain, so just keep cool and let it go."

915,"I vividly remember this incident,I was around 3 and half at time. My mother was completing her higher studies in her last semester. During the exams my aunt(Mother's Sister) used to baby sit me. As usual on the last day of my mom's exams,(While baby sitting)my aunt made me play with the Dry Battery Cells. The game was to roll the cell to and fro from my side to her's while we were sitting on the floor. Everything was going well,My naive aunt was doing a great job and I was thoroughly engaged.(The battery cell was exactly like this) But suddenly I realized,Mom is taking just too much time than usual. That was the moment of disaster,I can't really explain that moment,I took the cell(I was playing with) and threw it aiming at her head shot. It hit her hard,really really hard just above her left eye. The shot made her forehead bleed. She rushed to the hospital and got 3 stitches. The mark is still there just above her left eyebrows, It constantly rememinds me that memory. And I don't think I will ever forgot that moment!"

917,"I do not think Muslims hate him.1.) Let's take an example, BJP it self got 57/80 in Loksabha elections. UP contains 18.5% of Muslim population. It is obvious that majority of Muslims must have voted him during LS Elections' 2014.2.) Also in J&K Muslims have majority and there BJP got 25/87 Seats. Hence it is now clear that Muslims also like Mr. Narendra Modi.3.) A 12-year-old Muslim girl, studying in Class 6 of a Mira Road school in Mumbai, secured the first place in a Bhagwad Gita competition organised by the International Society for Krishna Consciousness (ISKCON). courtesy: The Hindu3.)

I love watching this movie. Who won't ?? Don't you feel this is the dream.2. The Duff - this is totally highschool love sort of movie, damn cute to handle !3. The Notebook - Mostly everyone would have seen the movie. No doubt about it.4. Enchanted - A cute princess story who enters into real world and falls in love with a ‚Äúnot a believer of love‚Äù type person. Mesmerizing. Again yeah not practical but I do believe you need to keep your common sense out before watching these romantic movies. That's why I watch them alone ;)5. Just like heaven - Amazing story of how a guy falls for a spirit and at the end she comes back to life just because he kisses her and her brain activates and heart starts beating. Again please don't judge me. Watch the movie it's rom-com, you will love it too (I can atleast hope for it ;) )6. Starstruck - Perfect love story of a girl not so interested in some superstar singer but falls for the exact same guy ! But still its that Teenage love story. The superstar who falls for a common girl.7. Endless love - this particular movie brings me goosebumps every time I watch it. How people meet someone like this like where ? I want to know that place !!Me : I want to have a love story like this but my love life sucks !Inner me : First you need to have one then it sucks ! ( Rolling my eyes )But this movie, it's amazing !This amazing lines is what the movie about , if you have found one don't lose the electricity :)we all should always remember this lines, Love should not be one of them ‚ù§Ô∏è8. Fault in our stars - what to say about this movie. I was crying all over for almost whole movie. But still I love the movie till eternity !Augustus Waters totally stole my heart ‚ù§Ô∏è9. The proposal - Ahh this dominating amazingly self independent woman who falls in love ahh ! Just love it !!10. My best friend's wedding - Amazing love story plus the friendship, totally worth it.11. 500 days of summer - Oh God what to say about this particular one. You all know it, but still for me the girl was really selfish.One person who loves this movie once told me that's how girls are. I argued hard that's not correct, but he had examples.

In the wild this actually works to the animal‚Äôs advantage, speeding reaction time to near double that of a human. (We have the instinct to ‚Äúthink about it‚Äù when there‚Äôs no time to do so.)

921,"Many people have already addressed the question with detailed explanations. I will try to add some more clarifications regarding resolution and number of channels.ResolutionWhen in a datasheet we see N-bit ADC or N-bit DAC, N refers to the resolution. For an ADC it is the number of bits the ADC outputs at each sampling time, while, in the case of a DAC, it is the number of bits of the input.2ùëÅ2N2^N represents the number of levels in which the amplitude of the analog signal is divided. For instance, if N=3 there are 8 levels.The following diagram can be used for an ADC or DAC.For an ADC the red sinewave represents the analog input, while the blue curve represents the sinewave quantized with 8 levels. The 3-bit numbers associated with each level of the quantized sinewave are the digital outputs of the ADC.For a DAC, the 3-bit numbers are the inputs of the DAC. The blue curve is the analog output of the DAC before the reconstruction filter. The red sinewave is the output of the reconstruction filter.Number of channelsAs regards the number of channels, let‚Äôs assume that we have 8 analog inputs and we need to digitize them with 10-bit resolution, and process them in an FPGA.We can use 8 ADCs in parallel, one for each input. Another option is to use a single 10-bit ADC preceded by an analog multiplexer.The multiplexer has 8 inputs selected by a 3-bit control signal. Based on the value of the control signal the corresponding input is selected and sent to the ADC. The ADC produces a 10-bit output at each sampling time.Yet another option is to purchase an integrated circuit containing both the multiplexer and the ADC. In this case we need to find an 8-channel 10-bit ADC."
922,"Find or make a room in your house for your meditation sessions. Try to keep one convenient time for your meditation and stick to it, like a routine thing. Let the room be without any furniture.Meditation can be done two ways, 1. sitting comfortably in any position (crossed legs) and 2. by walking (possibly with closed eyes).Lay a comfortable multi colored mat (of wool preferred), you may use a blanket right in the center of the room. You may bathe with luke warm water and appointed time enter the room. Sit comfortably on the mat (facing any direction eg. east, west or north or any).Close your eyes, focus on your nostrils, watch (with eyes closed) your inhalation and exhalation. Just watch the breathing, inhale belly goes out, exhale belly goes in. Just be watchful. If you cannot focus in few days, that‚Äôs okay. Let your mind wander wherever it wants to go and whatever it wants to do. Remember three things, nostrils, inhale and exhale. That‚Äôs all. Don‚Äôt force to inhale or exhale like you have to catch a flight or a bus. You have all the time in the world. Just sit be watchful of the nostril, inhale, exhale. Just be a witness.Feel the presence of your breath touching the nostrils, breath goes inside your lungs and belly goes out. Be watchful, breath energizes your body, you exhale, belly goes in and breath leaves the nostrils.Just sit like this for 15 minutes for the first fortnight or month. Increase by 5 to 10 minute thereafter. When you have gotten tired of sitting and doing this meditation, stand up and walk around the room doing the same. Breath touches nostril, breath goes in belly goes out, breath energizes the body, exhale, the breath leaves the nostril and repeat. When you get tired walking meditation, sit and meditate. That‚Äôs there is to do in this or any meditation. In the beginning you may have to do all this, one day it will all happen by itself and you will become the ‚Äúnon-doer‚Äù, meditation will happen, effortlessly. In the beginning it‚Äôs meditation and you, one day it will be just meditation alone, you will exist no more because you cannot identify yourself separately any more. It‚Äôs pure consciousness all around. You become the consciousness, you lose your identity.What to expect doing meditation? Nothing. All what‚Äôs been said by other Quoran‚Äôs is the byproduct of meditation. Meditation does not bring you happiness, more emotional intelligence, more energy to do your work, more sex energy, more of this or more of that and all that. These things will come to automatically because all your life you wanted them and they were running away from you. Now you have stopped running after these things so they will come back to you to entice you to sway you from your reality.Meditation does not bring anything to you except a transformation, a total transformation. You who had forgotten your trueself now you will discover your ‚Äúgodliness‚Äù.For example: Imagine, you are milk. Through the process of meditation you ‚Äúthe milk‚Äù can be transformed in to ‚Äúyogurt‚Äù, that‚Äôs the end. The process cannot be reversed, it‚Äôs a one way thing. Meditation transforms you, you are not longer the milk, you are yogurt. Meditation is the art of ‚Äúdying consciously‚Äù you are willing to allow the process, you the milk to die out and transform into yogurt - this a metaphor I am showing you. Milk is poison, but yogurt is very healthy (even in real life).The ultimate benefit of meditation is: how to die consciously and let go of being what you are. Meditation is the process of becoming the ultimate reality, the real you, nothing more nothing less. Just you ‚Äúas is‚Äù in the truest sense, you remove the mask of being what you have been made by society for many many incarnations. Now you discover your true Self.I would like to share with you Osho on meditation. Getting started on meditation.Now you are home, welcome home."
923,"The popular hypothesis on the expanding universe is partially summed up by the Big Rip (Big Rip) conjecture.We know that the universe is expanding. What is new is that there seems to be an acceleration to this expansion. If so, it will lead to some astounding dynamic events in the universe. As described in the Wiki article and in many other sites on the internet, at some point in the far future the expansion rate will become greater than the gravitational attraction of the galaxies, which will begin to move away from each other. Then galaxies themselves will diffuse and spread apart, then solar systems (which will be long dead by then), followed by stellar remnant disintegration, planetary disintegration, molecular disintegration.What happens next is still open to conjecture, but we can do a thought experiment and come up with a pretty good answer.The accelerating expansion will then pull electrons from nuclei and pull protons and neutrons from the nucleus.Now things become interesting. All the neutrons will decay to protons, electrons, and anti-neutrino within a brief time, leaving protons as the next target.But what happens when the expansion rate becomes greater than the strong nuclear force? Well, we know that the proton is made up of three quarks (two up and one down). We also know that quarks cannot exist in isolation. So what happens? The increasing expansion of the universe becomes greater than the strong nuclear force and pulls the quarks apart. This takes a great deal of energy. Where does this energy come from?As the quarks are pulled apart, they combine with virtual quark particles from the vacuum energy and form mesons; quark and anti-quark pairs. Normally, the mesons would decay very quickly (10‚àí8ùë°ùëú10‚àí1610‚àí8to10‚àí1610^{-8}to 10^{-16}) seconds, but the rate of expansion pulls the quark anti-quark pair of the meson apart before it can decay. This produces two more mesons, which produce four mesons, which produce eight, and we have an exponentially increasing creation of matter.Where does the energy come from to create all this matter? One proposed form of dark energy is that it is equivalent to the vacuum energy of space, that is, virtual particles. And dark energy is proposed as the energy of acceleration.So now we see that dark energy is being converted to matter in the form of quark anti-quark mesons and thus the amount of dark energy is reduced. If dark energy is reduced, so then is the acceleration of the universe. Eventually, we have complete conversion of dark energy to meson matter. But the expansion continues and meson matter continues to form.We can think of the initial expansion rate of the universe as inertia. The continued formation of meson matter then begins to slow down the expansion rate. But since we have an exponential growth of meson matter, the expansion rate will slow down rapidly.When the expansion rate slows enough, the mesons will then have time to decay into photons (gamma), electrons, positrons, neutrinos, and anti-neutrinos. The electrons and positrons will combine and decay into two gamma photons. So the resulting universe will consist of photons, neutrinos, and anti-neutrinos.What happens next is completely unknown and would require some clever and difficult calculations to arrive at an answer. Will the resulting expansion rate become negative? Will the significantly increased mass-energy of the universe contribute to a negative expansion (shrinking)?Lots of good things to think about here.Cheers!"
924,"You have asked many questions at the same time with the theme of Bihar & development. I think the theme is in trend more or less because Bihar with some other states (BIMARU) were considered extremely poor and underdeveloped .Though times have changed but conditions haven‚Äôt changed .The way politics has become superior than any other means of change and the way negativity spread across human minds are main reasons why these states along with many countries are lagging behind . To overcome all these things we need more involvement of common people in everything.Bihar like all other states were ruled by greedy people in last 2‚Äì3 decades.{ I don‚Äôt want to name them , but you can guess very easily.}Those ministers were involved in self- advancement and thus people started migrating in search of food and money. So called Gundaraj came into existence and thus people from marginal community and women were insecured.Crime increased day by day and literacy dropped.In last 10 years many things changed and it must be changed no matter who was ruling but many things are in worst ever condition.Yes , women feel secure now .They can roam here and there all day but not in night { because there is no need for them to roam in night} but where ? Only in Patna and some other cities not in villages.Illiteracy rate :huh what do you want ? Only to read a, b c, d.. and k ,kh , g ‚Ä¶ and do some sums .That is what you want to hear then YES people are at least literate . Whole world is doing PhD and we are talking about literacy. If you wanna learn you have no other option than to go to any private school because there is nothing in government schools except food , benches and buildings. You know private schools are very few and that too are not providing education of top class while charging high amount of money.There are many villages deprived of basic amenities of modern world like electricity , hospitals ,banking , roads and water.What do you think government has no money to spend on these things and has more than $15 million {100 crores} to spend on 350th Prakash Parv. No , government have providen enough for everything . Then why things are not changing ? You know why ? Because of corrupted officers and lack of governments interest.You asked ‚ÄòDo people get better facilities ?‚Äô I say ‚Äúwho the hell are they to provide facilities ? ‚Äù We need anything.

925,"The Homeopathic remedies carry great risk and damaging side effects. Refer ""Expanded work of Dr. E.B.Nash""¬† Preface page number xvii. It states that --The drug capable of curing, misapplied may kill instead of curing.The remedies offer cure only if used correctly. The misuse will harm beyond imagination and over use will kill.It is always advised to exercise great care during the Homeopathic treatment. Once the wrong remedy is given, the effect doesn't exhaust soon and quickly. Most of the remedies are very long and deep acting and apt to cause serious harm.Many a times I have been asked about the antidote?? The antidote may be used to neutralise or modify the effect, but the working period can never be reduced. The working period will depend upon the remedy, the potency and the quantity. According to one of the calculations a certain remedy in certain potency‚Äîone pill may work for about 600 (Six hundred) years. It would be worth to note that one drop of a liquid remedy is used for preparing 40 pills of a remedy. That means one drop will work at the rate‚Äî600x40=24,000 (twenty four thousand years)So, you can imagine the risk involved during the treatment.

This model has now been replaced with the ATH-M40x, but here are the specs for the M40fs:SpecificationsType: Closed-back dynamicDriver Diameter: 40 mmMagnet: NeodymiumVoice Coil: Copper-clad aluminum wireFrequency Response: 5 - 28,000 HzMaximum Input Power: 1,600 mW at 1 kHzSensitivity: 100 dBImpedance: 60 ohmsWeight: 8.8 oz (250 g) without cableCable: 11' (3.4 m) (OFC litz wire, left-side exit)Connector: 1/4"" (6.3 mm) phone plugAnd, here are some key specs for the M40x:Output sound pressure level 98dB/mWReproduction frequency band 15~24,000Hzi didn't list, above, the non-key specs that didn't change in the spec sheets. Notice that the M40fs actually has better specs for frequency response and efficiency.While i have not personally tried the M40x models, yet, i do suspect that they sound a little better, overall, than the M40fs. The M40x has a different construction, wherein i definitely see some advantages, as well. But, i do have extensive experience with the M40fs model, as well as many other studio-grade headphones. The M40fs has a very flat frequency response, and is a phenomenal value, particularly now.Other thoughts:Sony headphones get mentioned a lot in various forums, and many people like them. i don't mind them for live audio engineering/mixing, but they tend to have a bit of a boost in the upper frequencies that increases ear fatigue and reduces accuracy in the studio.You may want to consider some high-end earbud designs, as well. Because of their physical design, low frequencies can be translated with more perceptual feeling, and the SPL at the eardrum can actually be reduced without sacrificing perceived volume. You might be impressed with some of the newer dual-driver designs, in terms of audio reproduction.Audio-Technica is a great brand that i recommend frequently. They typically don't upcharge for their brand name, unlike Sony, Shure, Monster, etc."

928,"The are four steps to becoming a spy for RAWGet RealisticMeet the Basic and Advanced CriteriaApplyGo through vettingR&AW's Motto: The law protects when it is protected.The most important qualification to become a spy The first thing is you must realise if you are going to become a¬† spy is that the things you see spies doing in films and on television or¬† read about in novels are not even slightly realistic. You will not kill¬† people. You will not drive fast cars. You will not seduce attractive¬† foreigners. You will not defuse bombs with only seconds to spare. For¬† many intelligence roles you probably won't even get a gun.Most people realise that  James Bond and Jason Bourne are not realistic, but even supposedly realistic spies, like the ones  John Le Carr√© writes about, are not much like real spying.Here‚Äôs what Somerset Maugham, who was a spy for MI6, said about being a real spy in his novel  Ashenden:   The work of the agent in the Intelligence Department is on the whole extremely monotonous. A lot of it is uncommonly useless. One movie that was quite realistic (although about MI5 not R&AW) was¬†  Complicit. It might be worth watching that. So, let‚Äôs summarise the most important lesson about becoming a spy:¬† there will be no guns, no fighting, no fast cars and no sexy foreign¬† agents. Instead there will be lots of normal, boring hard work, like any¬† job.Are you sure you want to do this?¬†Basic Criteria Still here? Right, let‚Äôs talk about how to become an intelligence officer for R&AW.¬†  Remember ¬† Intelligence agencies have lots of other roles besides intelligence¬† officer. Translators, analysts, and IT work are less glamorous, but just¬† as vital.  Basic requirements to become a spy ¬†  Don‚Äôt get in trouble with the law. ¬† Any criminal record is likely to end your application. ¬†  Don‚Äôt do drugs. ¬† Drug tests are often given to applicants. Drug addiction is not tolerated. ¬†  Go to university. ¬† Most intelligence¬† organisations including R&AW expect their officers to have a good education. ¬†  Be ready to travel. ¬† Most spies have to travel to foreign countries. There are roles without travel but you will limit your chances. ¬†  Be a citizen. ¬† You must be a citizen of your country and so must the rest of your close family. So those are the basic criteria. But getting a job in intelligence is¬† very competitive. So you need to do more to stand out. Here‚Äôs a few suggestions:¬†Advanced Criteria Learn a foreign language¬†¬† ¬†¬† Preferably the language of your country‚Äôs enemies. Even better, learn a¬† relatively obscure language ‚Äì you will have less competition.  Do some sport. ¬† Being fit won't do any harm, and it looks good on your CV.  Don‚Äôt tell your friends you‚Äôre applying. ¬† Spying is about being discreet. If you can't keep your friends unaware, then you aren't going to make it.  Show you can work long hours. ¬† Get a job that demonstrates your discipline and commitment. Being a spy is not a 9-5¬† job. Often a case really is a matter of life and death and you won't be¬† able to go home until it is resolved. Show leadership.¬†  Military service might be an advantage here or some other leadership position. Don't hide anything. ¬† If you dabbled with drugs once or have a minor conviction they will find out, and if you try to hide it they will think you‚Äôre unreliable and untrustworthy. Keep out of debt. ¬† Some debt is OK, but don't show any sign of financial irresponsibility, you could be vulnerable to pressure or bribery. ApplyThe Research and Analysis Wing doesn't have a website, so it‚Äôs harder to apply to become a spy for them. However, jobs advertised as¬†  Deputy Field Officer, Cabinet Secretariat, Government of India are thought to be recruiting for R&AW. Otherwise entrance through the¬†¬† National Academy of Administration may be possible.VettingThe application process for an intelligence officer position ..."

930,"Yes.This is not fiction/non-proven(like telekinesis or telepathy) stuff. Dream controlling is real, and is studied by scientists.The term for it is Lucid Dreaming.The thing is, while you are dreaming, your brain simulates the reality. But it is not very good at doing it. However, most people still can't differentiate between dreams and reality because after all, its your brain that's tricking you, you can hardly help it.So, you use clues to get out of your minds traps.Simply put, there are many things that happen in a weird way in dreams. One example is, while you are dreaming, if you look at your hands, you will never see 10 fingers! (When I lucid dream, I usually see 2 pinkies, and sometimes my hands have so many fingers that I lose count while counting them.)If you try to read text in your dream, shift your focus away, and look again at the text, the text is very likely to change.If there is a tube-light shining, or a phone ringing, your actions of switching off the light, or picking up the phone will very likely cause no change, and the light will continue to shine, the phone will continue to ring.There are many other clues.So, if you make a habit of looking at your hands and counting your fingers every 20 minutes or so, your brain will start performing the action subconsciously. Then one night, you will end up looking at your hand, while you are dreaming. And you will count less or more fingers than you have. That means you are in a dream, and you know you are dreaming.Once you know you are dreaming, you can exert control over your surroundings, and even the way your dream progresses, but that is not for the absolute beginner.With practice, you can even personify your subconscious, and talk to it! It will tell you your deepest desires, it will let you relive the best moments of your life and much more. (ofcourse theres stuff like changing your surroundings, flying, having sex that you can do, but it gets boring after a while. Talking to your subconscious is really difficult, and is an enlightening experience)Lucid Dreaming can be used for many purposes including practicing things, creating your mind palace, solving problems and deriving creative inspiration.If you wish to read more about the topic, simply Google ""Lucid Dreaming"". There are loads of good websites dedicated to the topic, and you will find a handful of research papers.In response to the question posted in comments:Have you ever done this? How far have you gotten? How long did it take you? The answers to your questions are at the bottom.The following is how I got started with Lucid Dreaming.This post is long, and I am a bad writer, so please bear with me :(Let me tell you my story, but first you need to learn some trivia.Human sleep is a peculiar phenomenon, in which the brain simulates the environment, and you do your job. Dreams are very imperfect, can change suddenly but seem very real from the inside.Human sleep has many phases, each one has a distinguishable brainwave frequency band. The phase in which you dream is called Rapid Eye Movement (REM), and as the name suggests, your eyeballs move when you are dreaming (you can look at a persons eyes and tell if he is dreaming or not)While in REM, your brain puts you into a temporary paralysis, so that you don't end up enacting your actions in real life (like if you walk in your dream, you wont end up walking in real life)This is called sleep paralysis.Now, my story.I used to have weird dreams, and some repeating nightmares. As a kid I was always interested in weird stuff like hypnotism, UFOs, telepathy, telekinesis and the likes, but had zero knowledge about anything.So, my school library recruited a hobbyist librarian, whom I became friends with, and seeing my interests he handed me a book on UFO and alien abductions.Turned out, the book was not filled wi..."
931,"...and my long distance girlfriend asks me to answer this question. Michelle and I have had a long distance relationship for almost two years now. At the end of this month I'll be moving in with her, closing the three hundred mile gap that's been between us to zero. I can't wait.Here's how we did it, in no particular order:Be in each other's presence as often as possible. For us, that was an average of once a month for a weekend. That's rough, but better than nothing. I had many different coping mechanisms for this, and not all of them were healthy. A lot of self reflection and incredible patience from Michelle got me over the hump.Face time. If you can't be with each other, see each other. The webcam is a wonderful thing, use it. Google hangouts, Skype, whatever. Being able to share a smile, a goofy wink, blowing kisses, or just to stare in each other's eyes can not be understated.Phone time. If you can't be with each other or see each other, talk. As often as possible. Just hearing the other person's voice can do wonderful things to your psyche. Michelle and I would read Quora answers to each other.Patience. Your going to need a lot of this, and it's going to have to go both ways. I lack in patience. This had a tendency to make things more difficult than they needed to be. Don't be me.Understanding. Man, this long distance stuff is tough, isn't it? Always moping around, trying to ""find the time"" to get your stuff done and still spend some quality ""cam time"" together. All the stress, all the pressure. You do realize it's tough on your significant other too, right? Right? Sometimes, you just need to shut up and let your love vent their frustrations. Don't judge. Don't make it personal. Just listen and understand.Don't turn off your emotions. I did this. It was one of my coping mechanisms and it hurt Michelle and stunted my emotional well being. It sure seemed easier to shut down and not pine and mope and miss Michelle, but it's not. Don't do it.Communicate. Hey look, something else I struggled with. I had a thirteen year relationship with an alcoholic before Michelle, and quite honestly, I think I forgot how to communicate in a healthy relationship. Don't be me. Keep those lines of communication open and express yourself and your feelings.Love, unconditionally. Easy to say, harder to do. Relationships can be hard enough, long distance relationships even harder. Don't muck it up with a bunch of ifs ands or buts. Just love. That's why you're here in the first place.I can tell you without any hesitation that Michelle held this relationship together better than I did, and I'm thankful. I love her with all my heart and can't imagine where we'd be if she had let my stubbornness, my temper and many other flaws get in the way. I'm going to return the favor and A2A Michelle so you can see how to really make a long distance relationship work. Even with a putz like me.I love you, baby."

934,"Crosspost from U.S. Presidential Elections: Is Donald Trump likely to win the 2016 election? due to similarity of question.No. It is highly unlikely that ANY candidate can win the Presidency in modern America without much support from:HispanicsBlacksWomenYouthTrump has actively alienated each of these groups at some stage of his campaign, and in many cases multiple times. He has even made alienation of some of these groups a staple of his campaign. This has made Trump perhaps the most unpopular presidential candidate among non-whites in modern American history.The following favorable-unfavorable ratings are from November 8, 2015, so the ratings are likely even worse today than they were at the time given the level of discourse from Trump since then.Even the GOP understood that they must garner support from minority groups during the 2016 election cycle in order to stand a chance. See: 6 Big Takeaways From The RNC's Incredible 2012 AutopsyTrump essentially tore up the GOP's 2016 playbook, doused it in gasoline, set it on fire, then pissed on it for good measure.Trump's primary success is almost exclusively due to his appeal to white, (mostly male) disaffected nationalists - a particularly angry and vocal subset of the GOP base. While this group may be not only sustainable, but effective for the Republican Primary, it is a death sentence for any candidate's general election hopes. The changing demographics in the US simply don't favor him. There are simply not enough white nationalists (overt racists and/or borderline racists) out there to carry a candidate like Trump to victory.I predict that Trump will attempt to pivot and alter his message during the general election being the shapeshifter that he is, but I don't see that being a successful strategy. Unlike his current base of supporters who appear to be immune to rampant, pathological lying, general election voters have already seen through his bullshit and will not be so easily swayed by his shifting rhetoric."

938,"A friend of mine works in the Army Medical Corps. Which usually means she is a well paid nurse with a ‚ÄòLieutenant‚Äô attached to her name and she gets to know how differently men of different services hit on her. It also means that she is invited to officers only parties in fancy restaurants very often. One such ball was being hosted in a very expensive hotel in Kolkata and she had a +1 invite. Her not having a boyfriend and me being her best friend‚Äôs cousin automatically qualified me for the position. After being super excited for an hour and deciding on our itinerary she texted - ‚Äúyou cannot come‚Äù.WHAAAT??!!She expanded ‚Äúonly officers can come‚Äù. OK, I said. She added ‚Äúonly male officers can bring their civilian partners‚Äù.WHAAAT??!!I don‚Äôt exactly remember what I said after that but it should be along the lines of ‚Äúthose sexist grunts‚Äù or ‚Äúoppressive custards‚Äù and probably ‚Äúsoldiers deserve respect too‚Äù. I‚Äôm not going to discuss the rigidness of hierarchy in the Indian Armed Services because I am deeply grateful for what they have done and know that this is probably what got us through all the wars with substandard equipment and zero preparedness. Ben might want to comment on this. But I feel bad for the 3,50,000 soldiers. Those men on the ground who march around with rifles, work for menial salaries and get subpar treatment. Maybe this is what keeps them under control. Maybe this is what enables them to execute suicidal orders or not think about Coups. Maybe this is discipline.But this is only an extension of the Indian Society at large which has rigid Hierarchies.The old look down on the young. Men look down on women. Rich look down on poor. The wise look down on the uninitiated. We are far from an egalitarian society. It means that my importance in society dictates how I treat you. Just because I hold an engineering degree I will reject any technical opinion from you and if you are 10 years old, I will take offence for your high degree of sarcasm. Is that fair? NO. But sadly, that is what I have been seeing my entire life. They are not obvious lines only visible under duress.Its sometimes based on privilege sometimes on the sense of achievement. But people want to maintain themselves high up in the social order to feed there sense of importance. Often it goes beyond that and controls the distribution of resources too. And Caste is just another way to do it.‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚ÄîIts not just a linear hierarchical order - its a whole multi dimensional tree, with branches and leaves. Upper castes look down upon lower castes no doubt but even across a single level, different castes hold stereotypes and often do not intermarry. The Jats (a martial clan) are supposedly brash and Baniyas (tradesmen) are cunning, for example. People still cling on to their family names which are instant giveaways of their caste - Sharma for example is an obvious clergy name. And that only makes it easier for people to practice caste.At the receiving end of this system are Scheduled Castes and Tribes who form 20% of India‚Äôs population. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, any kind of prejudice (positive or negative) is wrong but its the SC/ST crowd which suffers the most. They are systematically segregated and oppressed. The worst part is that most of it is legal:Matrimonial classifieds are sorted by caste. We grow up watching this and do not take this seriously. We think its only natural to marry into your own caste. Because of this there is no intermingling or assimilation of the communities, reinforcing the divide. This legal structure is necessary because we need people to be identified by caste to avail them Reservations (Affirmative Action). Its like being stuck between a rock and a hard place. If you altogether outlaw caste based identity, the SC/ST will be completely overrun in the free market which would only enforce stereotypes about the poor while people still keep track of caste behind closed doors. This vicious cycle of stereotyping, oppression and deprivation will continue like it had before untouchability was abolished.But the primary reason Caste system still exists is public apathy. Reservations has caused a feeling of resentment among forward castes. They think that giving away seats in public sector jobs and higher education to the downtrodden is taking away the seats they deserve. This has only reinforced age old stereotypes. There are states in India where people have voluntarily given up caste names, only making use of it while seeking marriage alliances or applying for reservations. But those are results of bloody social revolutions while people in other states shamelessly carry on with their caste stereotypes.There are people who do not invite SC/ST inside their homes, who refuse to eat or drink from their place. There are people who would physically assault them over petty reasons. There are people who then call them ‚Äúundeserved‚Äù for availing reservations and then there are people who believe there are biological differences between castes. These people lack common empathy and believe that what‚Äôs wrong with the oppressed is none of their business. They fail to realize that the lineage they are so proud of comes from stealing from these folks.Things are definitely changing - especially in the urban middle class crowd. But we still have a long way to go. Especially since there are too many people who hold the aforementioned views. There is an influx of ideas and people on the whole are growing more accepting. The caste hierarchy is being replaced by a consumeristic one which is still better than what we have.(suggested by User-13331186939230997432 :P)images from:Dalit Netwerk Nederland (DNN)"

942,".Wells FargoWhile it‚Äôs never a good idea to spend more than you have in your account, it can happen. What does Wells Fargo do when you overdraw your account? It depends on the type of transaction and whether you‚Äôve enrolled in optional overdraft services.Here‚Äôs a look at Wells Fargo‚Äôs policies and two optional overdraft services:How Wells Fargo treats overdraftsLike many banks, Wells Fargo pays overdrafts at its discretion for the following transactions and charges a fee:Checks.Electronic payments using your account number.Automatic bill payments.If your account is not in good standing, or if you‚Äôve had frequent overdrafts, Wells Fargo may reject them instead of paying them and charge you a fee.Wells Fargo won‚Äôt normally cover the following transactions if you don‚Äôt have enough money in your account:ATM transactions.Everyday debit card transactions.Instead, it declines them without charging a fee, unless you opt into Debit Card Overdraft Service (see below). If you choose this service, fees apply.Here are details:There is a $35 overdraft fee.You can be charged up to four fees per day for a maximum of $140.Unlike some banks, Wells Fargo won‚Äôt charge a continuous overdraft fee if your account remains in the red for an extended period.Fees are deducted from your account the morning after transactions are processed.Optional: Wells Fargo Debit Card Overdraft ServiceIf you select this service, Wells Fargo will cover overdrafts that it doesn‚Äôt ordinarily cover ‚Äî those for ATM use or debit card purchases ‚Äî and charge fees for it. Due to the Overdraft Protection Act, banks must get permission from customers before covering overdrafts on ATM and debit card transactions.Many people are better off without this service; ATM and debit card transactions will be rejected if there aren‚Äôt enough funds in the account, and there will be no fee. But with the service, you run the risk of being hit with multiple $35 overdraft fees.Optional: Wells Fargo Overdraft ProtectionOverdraft protection is a service that links one or two accounts ‚Äî a savings account, credit card or line of credit ‚Äî to your checking account to cover any shortfalls.If you don‚Äôt have enough money in your checking account, Wells Fargo will transfer money or advance funds from one or both linked accounts, and charge you an ‚Äúoverdraft protection transfer fee‚Äù of $12.50.

943,"The first thing that came to mind was to build an App. I‚Äôm sure that you‚Äôve heard of Duolingo. They make learning a language simple, convenient, easy, and free. Yes they do it for free but they are now recognized on a global scale.Let me say two things before I go any further‚Ä¶I like Rosanie Bans answerGiving a small portion away for free helps to attract people to your business and YouTube is a great way to do it. I would offer the basics for free on YouTube and charge for intermediate and advanced learning (just an idea)Don‚Äôt be afraid of giving away something for free.A technique that many marketers do is to offer to give someone free content (like in your case a study guide) if they subscribe to their newsletter, or a free trial. Focus on bringing people into your business instead of charging people for anything and everythingIt‚Äôs hard to break into the world so I would suggest partnering with private schools, home school associations, and corporations dealing in international markets.SchoolsIf this were my business I would target small schools who have to find a third party to teach a foreign language. I would record enough videos and create a private playlist where the videos could only be seen on a website. To access the videos the school, teacher, or home schooling parent would have to pay you a monthly fee to access the videos.you could also offer to come an train the students in person.BusinessesI‚Äôm sure that there is a certain way to do this; however, I have not yet come across this in my research or experience. but many businesses invest in language programs to teach employees how to speak the language of whatever country they are going to operate in.Or, offer an online certification course for people who want to learn a language for professional reasons.But whatever you do‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs important to have a social media presence. I personally recommend that you have a Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, and LinkedIn presence.Good luck and let me know if you have anymore questions,Walter"
944,"Well according to USA Today:So as you can see my country, the USA pays $25,000 for gold.According to RealClearLifeIn general, nations that normally have a lot of Olympic success tend to cut back on the payments accordingly (even if the U.K. took it to the extreme), and those that have had less glory are prepared to be very generous. At the end, we‚Äôll explain why it‚Äôs particularly good to be a champ from South Korea.United Kingdom: $0Germany: $19,500U.S.: $25,000 (Yes, Phelps did pocket $125,000 off golds in Rio, though a good chunk of that will go right back to Uncle Sam.)China: $31,400South Korea: $55,000 (The special bonus will be explained momentarily.)Russia: $60,000France: $65,000Australia: $126,000India: $150,000Ukraine: $150,000Italy: $189,800Philippines: $215,000Thailand: $287,000 (also reported as $314,000)Indonesia: $384,000Azerbaijan: $510,000Taiwan: $640,000Singapore: $746,000 (As if Singapore‚Äôs Joseph Schooling didn‚Äôt already have reason to celebrate after topping Phelps in the 100m Butterfly.)Now to South Korea: Able-bodied males are expected to serve a 21-month tour of duty in the military by the time they turn 28‚Äîand if you‚Äôre an Olympian, it‚Äôs hard to argue you aren‚Äôt able-bodied. During their service, soldiers earn a stipend of $120 a month.

Here‚Äôs the catch, that money could be VERY different depending on what country you are from.Singapore pays the highest gold medal prize payout to athletes. Joseph Schooling will receive over 1 MILLION US dollars.Let‚Äôs see how the countries shakeout:USA:Olympics Money Per MedalGold	$25,000Silver	$15,000Bronze	$10,000Some other big competitors:Country	Olympic Gold Medal MoneyItaly	$180,000Russia	$135,000France	$65,000China	$31,400Germany	$19,500Some BIG payers:AZERBAIJANIn Azerbaijan gold medalists await a huge payday on top of the government-backed incentive of 400,000 Azerbaijani manat, which is almost $250,000.

Silver and bronze winners will get two billion rupiah, or $152,000, and one billion rupiah, or $76,000, respectively.THAILANDThailand reportedly guarantees a 10 million baht cash incentive for gold medalists, which is around $287,000. A silver medalist gets 6 million baht, or $172,000. The private sector often adds cash prizes too, usually amounting to additional millions of Thai baht.I hope this helps. Thanks for the A2A."

946,"There is reactance on both capacitor and inductor. It is the equivalent resistance in ac circuit. Their ac resistance depend on the frequency with opposite effect. Meaning as the frequency is increased, the capacitive reactance goes down while the inductive reactance goes up. The current in a capacitor is 90 deg leading the voltage while in inductor it is lagging. The reason of the reactance is the effect of continuous changing value of voltage applied and so the capacitor or inductor react to it. When peak voltage is reached the capacitor will tend to return the current the opposite direction to discharge while the inductor will conduct the same direction as the power source."
947,"Not by much.The main thing that makes Silicon Valley more expensive than the rest of California is the cost of real estate, of course. You can't buy an apartment on Amazon, so there goes a big chunk of the difference. Same with services of any kind, including restaurant meals, and cars, gas, insurance, and utilities. As for household items, there's a Walmart in Mountain View that's cheap enough; retail real estate may be expensive around here, but if you know how to use it efficiently, you can still offer pretty good prices. Most groceries are just too expensive to ship for Amazon to offer a good deal on them.Now the question asks not for Silicon Valley exclusively but for high cost of living places generally. The one place I know of where Amazon might save you serious money is New York City, and specifically Manhattan. Even groceries can get very expensive there, and any way to get far enough away from the urban core to get better prices is expensive and time-consuming enough not to be worth it."

949,"Why is salt water taffy candy imported in the United Kingdom?Is it? Never seen it anywhere. I only know the term from old Scooby Doo episodes.We don't have the word ‚ÄúTaffy‚Äù here, so if anyone wants taffy (rather than toffee or fudge), they would need to make it or import it.I asked an American living here what it was and I seem to remember she said it was softer than toffee, but not the same as fudge. If so, it might be different enough to import some, but probably not different enough to displace those two very popular types of traditional sweets*. If there aren't many people who want it, its unlikely to be economic to make it here. Especially if part of its appeal is in being a traditional american sweet.*I like bonfire toffee the best. You could definitely break a tooth on it though!"
950,"Lets begin with what factorial is. If I have a whole number 'n', then n! = n x (n-1) x (n-2) x ... 3 x 2 x 1. Now coming back to 0!, the simplest answer would be to compete a pattern. Lets take n=5, then5! = 5 x 4 x 3 x 2 x 1Now see the pattern:4! = 5!/5 = 243! = 4!/4 = 62! = 3!/3 = 21! = 2!/2 = 1 0! = 1!/1 = 1 Another way to explain is n! is the number of ways one can arrange n objects. Lets say if you got three boxes A, B and C on a table, you got 3!=6 ways¬† to arrange them. Let me take out C, then you got 2 boxes which can be arranged in 2!=2 ways. And if I take out B also, you are left with A which can be arranged in 1!=1 way. And as I remove A from the table, then what I am left with is ‚ÄãSo there is literally 1 way to arrange 0 objects on the table as there is no object at all. This one is bit philosophical.Lets get a bit advanced here. Consider the following graph between Whole numbers and their factorial value‚ÄãIn theory, we should get values between 2 and 3 too. How about factorial of 2.5 ? What do you think 2.5! would be ? And Mathematicians generalized this fractional factorial to Gamma function given by:‚ÄãAlso if n is whole number then, Œì(ùëõ)=(ùëõ‚àí1)!Œì(n)=(n‚àí1)! \Gamma \left( n \right) = (n-1)! which also gives 1 for 0!Now what's the point of having a function that will give you a factorial in between whole numbers when you can't arrange 2.5 objects in real ? So its a generalization and it turns out to be very useful in many case such as Probability. You can use them in formulas of Probability. Consider continuous entity like TIME unlike discrete objects we were considering till now, continuous events like TIME requires a more generalized idea of factorial or fractional factorial.

952,"‚ÄúCookie‚Äôs‚Äù life long lessons on the quest to be ‚Äúprettier‚Äù/sharing my knowledge [rop]don‚Äôt be easy or slutty. That is the best way to avoiding being ugly. Be choosy. Everybody says they do it but they really don‚Äôt. You don‚Äôt want to be easy or you will be the last girl that any guy takes seriously or wants to marry, women will not trust you, your rep will proceed you more than that $10 bottle of Victoria‚Äôs Secret Love Spell perfume you bathe in. Think about how guys think about strippers & adult film stars. That‚Äôs not the kind of ‚Äúpretty‚Äù you want to be, trust me. (Never allow yourself to be photographed nude!) it‚Äôs got/encompasses a lot of negative stuff. Hold out until you find Mr/(Miss) Right not Mr Right-Now. Think of your reputation as something valuable you can shape and affect with your behavior. It‚Äôs not cool to have three baby daddies. Virginity is pretty & can only be lost once.2. Watch your mouth. That means don‚Äôt curse (it‚Äôs not ladylike, it‚Äôs really uncouth), don‚Äôt lie (remembering what you lied about is a lot harder than keeping up with the truth), don‚Äôt spread rumors or hang out with people who gossip (if they speak in such a manner about another person you can guarantee they will have no reservations on ‚Äúwillful ignorance‚Äù on you). Don‚Äôt disrespect your parents. Make eye contact. Wear lipstick. Say funny and interesting things. Be memorable. Never be mean or rude or cruel, always be sympathetic/empathetic.3. You must do as best as you can with ‚Äúwhat you got‚Äù (your appearance). Exercise and lose weight. Clothes that are flattering (color costs nothing more, don‚Äôt wear anything too tight, too short, too risqu√©/slutty, wear nice shoes). Do your makeup and nails. Choose an attractive hair color and style. Go for natural colors. Bleach blonde or black may not be intended for you. Colors should resemble those found in nature. Long hair is the best. Short or emasculated styles are unbecoming. Guys don‚Äôt want to date one-of-the-boys. Be as feminine as you can. Hirsute is normally negative. Choose trendy glasses or get contacts. Glasses are a fashion accessory same as carrying a statement bag or having cute shoes.4. Personal hygiene (shower or bathe at least once a day), wear deodorant & use soap; have clear skin, touch up your makeup several times a day (don‚Äôt let it smear), brush your teeth/floss/don‚Äôt have gross breath; wear clean clothes, toss out old worn shoes, pay attention to smelling good (lotion & perfume), style up your hair (but remember you don‚Äôt want to keep a guy waiting, you don‚Äôt want to be late everywhere & take 3 hours to get to ‚Äúprettier,‚Äù so choose something simple/classic/realistic. Being late is never pretty), and do your makeup. Looks alone don‚Äôt make you pretty but no boy wants to kiss an ashtray so don‚Äôt smoke.5. Manners. Say please and thank you. Be gracious and kind. Be a graceful loser when it is your turn. Everyone has her triumphs and defeats.6. Don‚Äôt drink, smoke cigarettes or do drugs. Don‚Äôt be cheap. Don‚Äôt be over extravagant, overly political or overly religious, don‚Äôt be superficial, actually work on your education or career in earnest. Be honest, be as fair as you can, be firm, believe in yourself (you got this!). Remember moderation is key. No guys like nuns or zealots. Feeling pretty is acting the part. Remember you are acting a part. It isn‚Äôt the auditions for the ‚ÄúClueless‚Äù movie. Dumb on purpose isn‚Äôt cute. Once you start acting don‚Äôt be acting superficial and so fake. It will start becoming natural behavior to act ‚Äúprettier‚Äù (I say ‚Äúprettier‚Äù because I believe in you. You are pretty!), & soon it won‚Äôt be a farce like you had expected. Be as sweet as you can, it‚Äôs endearing & making yourself memorable is important. Take on a nickname. Mine is ‚ÄúCookie‚Äù because I have an interesting story to go with it and then people associate me with being sweet as well as original. Don‚Äôt rip off somebody else‚Äôs stories. Be an original! Be responsible always never reckless. It‚Äôs not pretty to be a badass. Guys don‚Äôt want to marry a felon. Don‚Äôt drink and drive, or even consider cheating (on a test, your boyfriend, etc), dishonesty is never pretty but a white lie won‚Äôt spare a friend the truth (‚Äúdo these jeans make me look fat?‚Äù) don‚Äôt ask those kind of questions. Have beliefs. Take a stand on an issue or support a charity. Don‚Äôt be wishy washy (‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know/I don‚Äôt care‚Äù guys get sick of that. They will find ways to avoid you if you let them pick every movie and restaurant). Be kind to animals, small children, people who have disabilities, senior cititzens, and veterans. Your parents know what is best for you so listen to them. Respectfully agree to disagree instead of arguing. People who like to argue because they get defensive aren‚Äôt pretty.7. Online behavior. Write as if you are literate. Don‚Äôt use shorthand for dirty phrases (‚Äúffs, stfu, lmfao‚Äù etc make you seem low class, even if you will never meet someone in real life keep it¬† classy class act.) don‚Äôt cyber bully or spread gossip. People are judging you based on the few photos you have released (don‚Äôt ever send Nude pics!), so make sure they aren‚Äôt overly filtered, photoshopped, strategically angled pics that nobody would recognize you on the street but do pic naturally causally posed photos in good natural light that show you off the best). But I get a bad impression of a girl who doesn‚Äôt know basic grammar or spelling. Yes, pretty girls are literate!8. Fake it til you make it! If you employ all of my advice you will certainly be ‚Äúprettier,‚Äù people will hold you in high esteem so you can check that low self esteem at the door. Low self esteem is ugly so is too much arrogance. Love yourself. You are your own most valuable advocate. Cut loose the toxic people in your life and hang out with other truly ‚Äúprettier‚Äù individuals who thrive on encouraging each other not tearing them down. Being pretty much any just plastic surgery, Botox, or perfect teeth with a 24‚Äù waist. ‚ÄúPrettier‚Äù is a lifestyle change. You will falter once in awhile, mo one is perfect, but it will begin an entire new mindset when people react to-, and enforce, the positive behavior & changes you have made in your life. People will sit up and take notice. Enjoy your new found attention. Take a girl who has low confidence under your wing once you get this ‚Äúprettier‚Äù thing down and passing the torch can be so satisfying! I‚Äôm passing it to you. What will you do with this knowledge??Sorry I went anon I knew this would be long & im trying to follow my own advice. Sometimes you just have to bear high school like the cross it is that everyone has to bear. I was SEVERLY bullied to the point of wanting to end my life back then. I am much better now. Leaving school (graduation of prep school & 3 stints in different colleges) was the best thing to happen to me. My journey to ‚Äúprettiness‚Äù began when I found the Internet & ive never looked back. I live a fulfilling and rewarding life in real life and I find social media friendships incredibly gratifying and satisfying. Okay I will let you digest what I said. You don‚Äôt need to be considered pretty by anybody but yourself. Becoming ‚Äúprettier‚Äù is a life long calling and vocation and every woman can do it. Never apologize for who you are. You are pretty. ‚ÄúWould a rose still smell as sweet by any other name?‚Äù"
953,"So I'm gonna go ahead and add some of my favorite albums that I didn't see on here. I'll order it broadly by genre, but not by how much I like each album.Hip Hop:The Love Below - Outkast. While this is only Andre 3000's half of Outkast's double album, it functions as an album on its own. It's a concept album which vaguely tells the story of a couple. Besides the lyrics, which are pretty awesome, the whole album is a genre bending monster, featuring just as many elements of jazz, funk, and rock as it does hip hop (even including a remix of John Coltrane's version of ""My Squanch Things"").The Lucy Ford EP's/God Loves Ugly - Atmosphere. Two of their early albums. Slug takes his deeply introspective, hold-nothing-back approach to writing while Ant produces some great beats sampling everyone from Bartok to Cannonball Adderley. Ant has this kind of droney way of making beats where the song mostly consists of repetition of the same short phrase, which takes a very talented producer to pull off.Camp - Donald Glover. Another highly introspective hip hop album. Not sure how much I can say about this, it would be hard to describe it without reducing it.Classic Rock:Pet Sounds - The Beach Boys. Though I've seen Srgt. Peppers a couple times scrolling through the list of answers, I was surprised that I didn't see the album that inspired Srgt. Peppers. I always thought Pet Sounds was a lot better than Srgt. Peppers (just my opinion, please don't kill me), and although I can see why others might find it to be cliched, but I don't really mind that it's a big collection of love songs (especially when some of the love songs are as amazing and genuine as ""God Only Knows""). Also, it really shines through that the person who wrote this album was the bassist, since it has some killer bass lines, which is especially notable given that prior to this album rock bassists rarely did anything besides play the bass note of whatever chord the guitar/keyboard was playing.Aja - Steely Dan. I can't say I'm overwhelmingly surprised to see that there's no love for Steely Dan on this list given that there's generally little love for Steely Dan in the world in general (not that people hate them, but they're just mostly forgotten). Well this album is a work of genius in my opinion. It is meticulously put together from a combination of great songwriting and great musicianship (my father says all the time that the title track of this album contains the best drum solo ever). Steely Dan comprises of only a keyboardist and a guitarist, neither of whom, despite being great songwriters, are truly amazing at their instruments, and so they hire other musicians to play on their albums. Their fame and songwriting abilities gives them the pick of the litter and they end up coming out with amazing solos on all of their songs.Chicago II - Chicago. ""Is it in fact unfair to criticize a formerly great artist for [their] latter day sins"" - High Fidelity. Well I'm not sure, but this album sure is great. Terry Kath's guitar playing really makes it (whether its his soloing on ""25 or 6 to 4"", or his low key vamping on ""Movin' In"") which makes sense why this band really went down the tubes when he died.Modern Rock (1980 Onwards)Room On Fire - The Strokes. Though its generally overlooked in favor of their much more popular debut album, I will always love The Strokes' sophomoric effort more. I'm not entirely sure if that's because its music is more to my style, or if it just holds a special place in my heart because it was the first Strokes album I ever listened to, but I love it in a way that I love very few albums.Good News for People Who Love Bad News - Modest Mouse. Yet another album that I love ALOT. I came across it in a time of my life where its themes (mostly the inevitability of death) spoke to me in a really core way, and I think it probably changed who I am permanently. Opens up an interesting question though: this album was arguably Modest Mouse's sell-out album (switching from more of a rough indie sound to alternative, signing to a major label, etc.). Assuming that it is (just for the sake of argument), does this reduce its artistic meaning?Fusion JazzApocalypse - The Mahavishnu Orchestra. The Mahavishnu Orchestra and the London Symphony Orchestra team up to play on an album which is somewhere in the gray squanch between rock, jazz, and classical music. That's all that needs to be said.Renaissance - Marcus Miller.NOTE: Aja could also go here, but Steely Dan tends to lean more towards the rock side of the fusion spectrum so I put them in Classic Rock.JazzLady Sings the Blues - Billie Holiday. I don't have a ton to say about this one. Just an awesome album.On Time - Dave Brubeck. All around great modal jazz album, but ""Take Five"" is my indisputable favorite track on this one. If you don't think you've ever heard ""Take Five"", then you're probably wrong. It's one of those songs.Kind of Blue - Miles Davis. Now, Iknowthis one has been listed already, but how could I leave it off? Squanch certainly revolutionized jazz, but also arguably set the stage for jam rock in the '60's. Besides any of that though, it's a great album and I don't think I could ever get bored of it.Progressive MetalPassion and Warfare - Steve Vai. This album set the bar for virtuoso guitar playing from its release to the present (or at least until 2009, but I'll talk about that in a minute).Images and Words - Dream Theater. The Progressive Metal album that started the classic Prog Metal sound, which has, at this point, become common enough that if anyone besides Dream Theater tries to play it straight they just sound like their copying Dream Theater.Animals as Leaders - Animals as Leaders. The newest album (2009) that rocked the Progressive Metal/Virtuoso guitar world. With added elements of jazz, and increased complexity of chordal harmony, Animals as Leaders (and especially their guitarist Tosin Abasi) really raised the bar with this one. I expect this sound will be just as cliched in 25 years as Images and Words' sound is now.Albums from 2015Not every album has to be a classic to be great. Here are some of my favorite albums that have squanch out since the beginning of the year:RockLive at the Beacon Theatre - Umphreey's McGee. Great jam album.Jazz/FusionAfrodeezia - Marcus Miller.The Epic - Kamasi Washington. Who would've expected a 3 hour long hardcore fusion album would be released in 2015?The Squanch of Spring - The Bad Plus. Okay, I cheated a little, this one is from 2014, but how could I not include a jazz Fusion reimagining of Stravinsky's Rite of Spring.Progressive MetalShockwave Supernova - Joe Satriani. I gotta say, he's still got it.Earthkeeper - There Dogs were Astronauts.Inmazes - Vola.Love, Fear, and the Time Machine - Riverside. This might fit better under the banner of Progressive Rock.There's no such thing as the best album because there isn't finite beauty in the world. I can listen to all these albums, and many, many more and come away with the impression ""that was the most beautiful thing I've ever heard"", only to find myself saying the same thing about a different album 40 minutes later. What this means is that if you're on a quest to find the best album, then you're doomed to failure, but if you're on a quest to listen to great music, then you are at the doorway of a fruitful and wonderful adventure that will last your whole life. Whether its The Beatles, or some local band at a small venue, you can find beautiful music everywhere.If you haven't heard all the albums above, then I suggest you take a day to pick through a couple of them. You'll probably hate some of them, and feel meh about most of them, but you just might love some of them.Good luck, and happy listening.EDIT:I am ashamed to announce that it has taken me this long to get around to listening to it, but I have to say that Kendrick Lamar's To Pimp a Butterfly definitely deserves a spot on my list.¬† Aside from the overwhelming importance of the themes that it tackles, it is a work of pure genius.¬† It wears its heart on its sleeve so blatantly and effectively that it prompted my sister to say ""If David Foster Wallace was alive today he would have no career.¬† His movement has gone mainstream."""
954,"Original Question: What will happen now that President-elect Donald Trump has won the election?Nothing.America was always America.The people who voted for Trump always existed. You live in the same neighborhood as them. Your children go to school with them. You wave at them when you shop at the grocery store or mall. Some of you even pray to the same God and worship with them at church.They were angry. They didn't like the direction Obama was taking the country. He was beginning to turn the massive ship called America around.Poor people were able to access health care. Gay and lesbian people were beginning to gain rights. Immigrants, of all types, believed the American Dream was finally becoming a reality.Trump and his supporters didn't ever want anything to truly change. They still controlled most of the resources and wealth of the nation. But they made us think they were post-racial, post-misogynistic, post-xenophobic and pro-all American people united as 1 for almost 8 years.Overwhelmingly, the Silent Majority joyfully crushed our hopes by going to the polls.Poor Lives Don't Matter. Gay and Lesbian Lives Don't Matter. Latino and Latina Lives Don't Matter. Immigrants Lives Don't Matter. Islamic Lives Don't Matter.The American Dream is real and only matters for the Silent Majority.Nothing ever really changed.It's the same America.Don't let the smartphones and dating apps fool you."
955,"Girls with autism have long been misdiagnosed as their symptoms look quite different from those of their male peers on the spectrum.When a child is sent for diagnostic testing to determine an autism spectrum disorder (ASD), the tests, traditionally, are the same for both males and females. Depending on the age of the child being screened for ASD, markers will vary, but generally speaking, doctors test a child‚Äôs developmental and social skills as well as sensory processing abilities.Girls will often still exhibit classic symptoms of autism including sensory processing difficulties, hypo or hypersensitivity to pain, delayed verbal skills, self-injurious behaviors, a low threshold for frustrating situations or extreme passiveness, and even co-occurring seizure disorders.Boys and girls develop differently particularly throughout puberty. Girls are traditionally thought to mature faster, develop social skills and emotional intelligence sooner, and have a greater awareness of the world around them. These differences are often noticeable between neurotypical boys and girls as well as boys with autism and their neurotypical peers of both genders. However, autism in girls frequently present to be less socially adept than their neurotypical female peers but do not seem to struggle as much as boys of the same age with autism.Women and girls with Asperger‚Äôs syndrome often find themselves misdiagnosed or at a higher risk for co-occurring conditions which may be derived as coping skills or entirely separate issues.Women and girls with Asperger‚Äôs syndrome are likely to have higher instances of depression, bipolar disorder, anxiety, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).You can find more information and detailed instructions here: Signs of Autism in Girls - Is Asperger‚Äôs in Girls Overlooked?"

957,"Actually, there is a theory that might answer your question. It's called Solipsism¬† and it asserts that,..nothing exists but the¬† individual‚Äôs consciousness. At first it seems silly ‚Äì I mean how can deny the existence of the world around us, and too when s/he is a part of it, living in it? But when you put your mind to it, it really is impossible to verify anything but your own consciousness. Think again!!Hard to believe, huh? But is it?Think for a moment and think of all the possible dreams that you have experienced in your life, the dreams that even though were part of your sleep, felt nothing but true to you when you were in them. Now think calmly. Is it not possible/absolutely impossible that everything around you is nothing but an incredibly intricate dream? A dream that you still are seeing and haven't got out of? Think.But we have people and things around us that we cannot doubt, because we can hear, see, smell, taste and feel them, right? Yes, and no.¬†People who take LSD, for example, say that they can touch the most convincing hallucinations, but we do not claim that their visions are 'reality'.¬† Your dreams simulate sensations as well, after all, what you perceive is what different sections of your brain tell you to.Solipsism has to face it's share of criticism too. But well, an idea is an idea after all.Suggested reading:SolipsismSolipsism and the Problem of Other MindsWhy Solipsism is BullshitThere is also another very interesting theory I read some time ago. In the movie The Matrix, Morpheus says,‚ÄúIf real is what you can feel, smell, taste and see, then ‚Äòreal‚Äô is simply electrical signals interpreted by your brain.‚ÄùNow let us give it a thought. Though science-fiction, the film The Matrix ponders on a very important scientific problem: that there is currently¬† no way for us to know for certain if what we experience is real or a¬† merely a grand sensory fantasy fed to our brains directly. All of the input information¬† that we receive arrives to us from our eyes, ears and other senses.Prominent scientists and philosophers have calculated that there is at least a twenty-percent likelihood that we are all, in fact, living in a simulation.Read this: Are You Living in a Computer Simulation?Also, scientists are currently fitting¬† deaf children with Cochlear brain implants that allow them to hear¬† despite having no physical ear-drums at all. Similarly, there are a¬† number of devices under development that can be implanted directly into¬† the visual cortex of the brain, allowing blind people to ‚Äúsee‚Äù a digital¬† video image of the world around them.It actually makes you think that maybe reality is all in our own minds. We do not actually experience the¬† real world, only the images, sounds and sensations fed to us by our¬† senses. It‚Äôs true that this fantasy is directly influenced by the¬† physical universe but research has shown that we all perceive the¬† outside world in very different ways.Since all experience occurs within your mind, the memories that you¬† hold leading right up to this very moment are as valid as any dream.Is ‚Äúreality‚Äù a dream? I believe that it‚Äôs more like a memory of what¬† our senses perceived a millisecond ago. A story told to us by our minds¬† to represent our experience of the physical universe.From an objective viewpoint your ‚Äúmind‚Äù would not exist at all. An¬† objective observer would only see the movement of atoms and electrons¬† within your brain. Subjective experience is eternally, absolutely¬† subjective.‚ÄúReality is merely an illusion, albeit a very persistent one.‚Äù¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† - Albert Einstein"
958,"Yes, you can live comfortably in Arlington, VA on $80,000. Before my wife and I were married, we both earned well under that bottom number, and we both lived separately and comfortably in VA. She was in the Courthouse neighborhood of Arlington, and I lived in Alexandria.If you were to budget 25% of your salary (using the $80k mark) for housing, you‚Äôd be looking at $1600/month (or thereabouts) for rent. You should have little difficulty finding an apartment within walking distance of cool restaurants, bars, shops, and the subway for that price. You might even be able to rent a house for that. Then take on some roommates to defray that cost even further.Add in other utilities, and you can still be comfortably around 33% of your take home pay, leaving you some discretionary income left over for going out, and enjoying all the DC area has to offer.A little further out there is an area of Fairfax called the Mosaic District. Also close to the subway (Metro), it‚Äôs a recently developed ‚Äútown center‚Äù concept. Lots of great little shops and restaurants, including a big new Target, and a movie theater.TL;DR; Yes, you can live quite well on $80‚Äì114K/year salary in the DC area."
959,"When you desire information that someone else has, it's often a good idea to simply ask the person for the information.This is ineffective if the person wishes to keep the information secret, but most people are comfortable talking openly about their relationship status.In which case, the only reason you wouldn't ask is your own desire for secrecy. You don't want the person to know that you're curious about their relationship status, probably because you don't want them to know that you're romantically interested in them. You'd feel embarrassed if you asked them out and they had a boyfriend.At that point, you can ask their friends, or you can try to subtly elicit the information without directly asking for it. If those options are not available to you, then you put on your grown-up undies and *ask*."
960,"Avocados are truly an amazing food for many reasons, but until recently, you wouldn‚Äôt know it. Years of being scared away from fat-containing foods have led many people to overlook avocados. Today ‚Äî thanks in part to the low-fat diet risks that have been revealed ‚Äî we know that avocado benefits include critical, healthy fats in addition to much more: various antioxidants, multiple trace minerals and vitamins too.You may be wondering, is an avocado a fruit or a vegetable? In fact, avocados are actually a fruit. They are great in both savory and sweet dishes.Avocados are a nutrient-dense fruit that contain about 20 vitamins and minerals. Given its nutritious make-up, there are many avocado benefits. These include better heart and digestive health; healthy skin, hair and eyes; cancer prevention and weight loss, among others.1. Improved Heart HealthAvocados (and especially avocado oil) promote heart health by balancing blood lipids because of their fatty acid composition. In terms of their chemical make-up, avocados are about 71 percent monounsaturated fatty acids, 13 percent polyunsaturated fatty acids and 16 percent saturated fatty acids.2. Lower Risk for Metabolic SyndromeEating avocados has been found to be clinically associated with lower metabolic syndrome in U.S. adults. Metabolic syndrome is a term for a cluster of conditions that increases your risk of developing heart disease, stroke and diabetes. Some other avocado benefits include help with: hypertension, high blood sugar, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, obesity and excess body fat around the waist.Essentially, eating avocados helps regulate hormones associated with risk factors for diabetes, obesity and cardiovascular diseases, including insulin, triglycerides and cholesterol.3. Healthy Skin, Eyes and HairAvocados are a high-antioxidant food that contain lutein, a type of carotenoid that protects eye health and preserves healthy, youthful looking skin and hair. Carotenoids are the group of antioxidant phytochemicals found in veggies like carrots, squash and sweet potatoes that are known for blocking the effects of environmental toxins like pollution and UV light damage.To promote a healthy, shining complexion, simply rub the inside of an avocado peel on your skin and use avocado oil as your primary moisturizer. Mix in some therapeutic essential oils and you can easily make a cost-effective lotion instead of pouring out money for that store-bought stuff filled with irritating chemicals! Avocado can also be used to make homemade hair masks to replenish, moisture and add shine.4. Cancer PreventionSeveral studies have surfaced recently touting avocado as a cancer-fighting food. The Journal of Nutrition and Cancer published the results of a study, for instance, claiming that the phytochemicals in avocados are so powerful that they could prevent the use of chemotherapy in people with oral cancer!

963,"When I was a little girl, I loved horses so much that I broke the leg off the donkey from our expensive Christmas Nativity set playing with it (it still leans against the wall of the barn every Christmas), and I stole a gorgeous plastic horse from a toy store, but my mother made me return it and I confessed it at every single confession (I was Catholic) until the priests must have wanted to strangle me. I wanted to go blind so I could own a seeing eye dog like the boy in the book FOLLOW MY LEADER by James Garfield.My family finally got a poodle without me having to go blind. After my parents died, I settled for a stray or abandoned cat because I was working full-time. I have now been owned by three cats, two still living. As my sister said when I was sobbing over the death of my first cat, ‚ÄúThe only bad thing about pets is that they die too soon.‚ÄùOn the other hand, I don‚Äôt march in protest over the treatment of animals, I regretted the end of Ringling Brothers‚Äô Barnum & Bailey Circus (despite the live animals being mistreated), and I eat meat."

965,"To have pain 7 week post operatively is not unusual. This is also variable upon your level of activity including the physical therapy that you I assume are partaking in. Also your overall state of health including the ability to heal fast. If you a diabetic then healing is a longer process which can translate to longer lasting pain symptoms. As I have always said to my patients that the pain you may be experiencing is post operative pain and will generally gradually decrease over the first 3 months post operatively. However there are many factors that can escalate you pain symptoms from day to tay. Firstly increased activity such as ambulating around your environment, secondly physical therapy. Remember when you have a total knee you are incising through fat and muscle and then cutting bone to accommodate the upper and lower components of total knee. In addition your severing sensory nerve ending which regenerate very slowly over time and those areas initially that felt numb begin to awaken generating pain. Another issue that could cause knee pain at this point is the possibility of a occult or small infection within the knee that may be festering within the capsule of the knee joint, that is not enough to cause systemic symptoms but perhaps locally. In any case for all the possibilities, and I just listed a few the only way to truly to get the most precise and accurate answer is to discuss your concerns with the orthopedic surgeon who did your total knee. He is the one who can examine you and image your knee to determine if in fact there is some going on as described or as simple that your a slow healer. Getting an accurate answer in this forum is is anybody's guess since know one here can examine your knee, and have the ability to do what your orthopedic surgeon has at their disposal to accurately answer your question."

967,"Making friends and being a ""People Person"" are two completely different things. While making friends is on the easier side as compared to latter as being a people person demands a great deal of abilities and self determination. instead of giving lectures, we can understand this using a situation in all cases.Hero of the Group :Start talking when you're in a group. Everyone respects and want to befriend the person who can easily interact with people in a group. The one who can make others laugh is the one who is most talked about. Being an introvert doesn't help.You may feel ignored at first or out of the topics. But being good at something takes time. Forget what other people will think about you if you say something wrong. Everyone is too busy to think about you.Be the Boss: Never show your weakness to others. Don't give people the chance to judge you on anything. Consider yourself the boss, who can do anything. Don't confuse it with ""bragging"". Remain motivated and Enthusiastic: None really want to talk to the guy who doesn't take interest in them. I won't talk to the one who doesn't wanna listen to me. So develop interest in people. Interest in people can be developed by thinking about their abilities and skills. If you think and talk about their weeknesses, it certainly isn't gonna do anything good.Find out people like you: For makings friends, you just have to look the people who share same interests with you. Let's say you read books, then being friends with a book addict isn't a daunting task. Talk about books you have read and know about books the person has gone through. Respect his thoughts and views. Start by sharing books and giving valuable suggestions.Be Ready to help: Help people more than getting help from them. If you always talk about your problems, the other guy may lose interest in you. Listen to his problems and advise some solutions.Don't take anyone for granted. Everyone wants to be respected, keep this thing in mind while talking with anyone.Learn to initiate conversations. Keep your shyness or ego or attitude aside for a moment and start initiating conversations. You will get a very good feeling after doing so.Don't just remember the people when you need them. Be ready for them when they need you too. Someone has rightly said ""best time for making friends is before you need them""."
968,"...and my long distance girlfriend asks me to answer this question. Michelle and I have had a long distance relationship for almost two years now. At the end of this month I'll be moving in with her, closing the three hundred mile gap that's been between us to zero. I can't wait.Here's how we did it, in no particular order:Be in each other's presence as often as possible. For us, that was an average of once a month for a weekend. That's rough, but better than nothing. I had many different coping mechanisms for this, and not all of them were healthy. A lot of self reflection and incredible patience from Michelle got me over the hump.Face time. If you can't be with each other, see each other. The webcam is a wonderful thing, use it. Google hangouts, Skype, whatever. Being able to share a smile, a goofy wink, blowing kisses, or just to stare in each other's eyes can not be understated.Phone time. If you can't be with each other or see each other, talk. As often as possible. Just hearing the other person's voice can do wonderful things to your psyche. Michelle and I would read Quora answers to each other.Patience. Your going to need a lot of this, and it's going to have to go both ways. I lack in patience. This had a tendency to make things more difficult than they needed to be. Don't be me.Understanding. Man, this long distance stuff is tough, isn't it? Always moping around, trying to ""find the time"" to get your stuff done and still spend some quality ""cam time"" together. All the stress, all the pressure. You do realize it's tough on your significant other too, right? Right? Sometimes, you just need to shut up and let your love vent their frustrations. Don't judge. Don't make it personal. Just listen and understand.Don't turn off your emotions. I did this. It was one of my coping mechanisms and it hurt Michelle and stunted my emotional well being. It sure seemed easier to shut down and not pine and mope and miss Michelle, but it's not. Don't do it.Communicate. Hey look, something else I struggled with. I had a thirteen year relationship with an alcoholic before Michelle, and quite honestly, I think I forgot how to communicate in a healthy relationship. Don't be me. Keep those lines of communication open and express yourself and your feelings.Love, unconditionally. Easy to say, harder to do. Relationships can be hard enough, long distance relationships even harder. Don't muck it up with a bunch of ifs ands or buts. Just love. That's why you're here in the first place.I can tell you without any hesitation that Michelle held this relationship together better than I did, and I'm thankful. I love her with all my heart and can't imagine where we'd be if she had let my stubbornness, my temper and many other flaws get in the way. I'm going to return the favor and A2A Michelle so you can see how to really make a long distance relationship work. Even with a putz like me.I love you, baby."
969,"I was in China recently and noticed how Chinese people look down at their English, even when they do speak it quite well. I believe that is a cultural thing. As Michael Affleck mentioned your English is excellent and your question was very well expressed.My suggestion is that you work on changing your mindset about your English knowledge. Just because all your countrymen say their English is bad, you don‚Äôt need to do the same.Start thinking and saying to yourself that English is an easy language to learn even though it‚Äôs very different from Chinese. Stop comparing yourself to the foreigners you mentioned.Think about when you didn‚Äôt know any English and started learning it, and realize how much progress you have made since then. You do know a lot of English and can express yourself to a certain extent. Now, you would like to become even better in it and work towards that goal.However, you won‚Äôt be able to progress in it without accepting that you do know lots of English compared to years ago. And now, with the Internet and other tools, it‚Äôs very easy to expand your knowledge.I suggest that you create an English club at your university and invite whoever wants to talk in English to participate. Think about topics to talk about. Read English books and get together to discuss them. Watch English movies together and do the same. Listen to music and sing along together. Ask English teachers at your school for suggestions. As other students start to come, ask them for suggestions.The more you use your English, the easier it will become and the more confident you will feel speaking and writing it!Take action and have fun!"
970,"‚ÄúI was diagnosed with ovarian cancer..and I won the battle with it.‚ÄùFast rewind 2 months from now, it was the time of diwali when suddenly one night, I suffered from severe stomach pain in the right side of my lower abdomen. The pain was impossible for me to take. I was shivering badly which came with the pain I still guess so, because I wasn‚Äôt having cold or fever anyway. But the next day the pain was gone. The whole day there wasn‚Äôt any feeling of pain or anything really, so I ignored thinking it to be due to indigestion or anything minor. But it returned again. And this time it was around 3am to 6:30am approximately. And it repeated for next 2..3 days continuously. Finally an aunt of mine advised me to go for a checkup as these kind of pain should not be taken lightly. She was a nurse and she doubted it to be appendicitis as all my symptoms matched with it. I had stomach pain that too in the right side. It was the symptom of appendicitis.The next day my father took an appointment to see the doctor, though I was not in a mood to go through a checkup because the pain did not come back from that night after my aunt advised me so. Though my mother insisted and we went to the doctor. The doctor checked my abdomen and advised me an ultra sound test. And the reports came to be a tumour like mass covered my right ovary which was of size 5‚Äì6cm. I was shocked. I had no symptoms of it and it reached to such size that there is no way left else than surgery for it to be taken out of me.My whole family was shaken at the report and father decided not to do any treatment here in Assam and we went Bangalore where my brother was staying. My brother searched for the best hospital for such a treatment and also the best doctor for the case. We listed out two amongst all - Manipal and Narayana. And we selected Narayana for the treatment. (I‚Äôm mentioning every detail of my hospital and doctor so that if there is any reader or your belonging suffering same, you can trust the hospital blindly and also the doctor who treated me..because I‚Äôm experienced and trust me its the best.) We met this doctor Dr. Rohit Raghunath Ranade, an oncologist, gynecologist at Narayana Mazumder Shaw medical centre, a unit of Narayana. I will tell you later why this hospital is the best and also the doctor.So we met him and discussed what has happened till now. I showed him the ultra sound reports and he asked me few questions like‚Ä¶ do my periods come regularly? Do I feel irritation while urinating? Do I get the feeling of hunger normally? Do I get tired at every little walk or work I do? And when was the last time I got my period‚Ä¶. My every activity and body function was normal, I had none of the above problems he asked. He asked me to do some blood tests and an MRI ( Magnetic Resonance Imaging) and meet him the next day with the reports. He doubted it to be a cyst as there was no symptoms for it to be a major anything. We became so happy at the news though he was not sure about it still it was a relief for us to hear that as cyst is not a harmfull thing and it can be taken out through micro surgery.We did accordingly, went through several blood tests and an MRI. My blood reports came normal, there was nothing in my blood and the MRI was a bit difficult for us to understand. Still the blood reports were a sign for us that nothing major happened to me. My parents took a breath of relief at the reports and was confident enough to step in the chamber to see the doc. We were expecting to hear it from the doc that ‚Äúthere is nothing to be worried of she will be fine either of medicines or with a small micro surgery thats it‚Äù‚Ä¶We met the doc with reports and he went through it thoroughly.

975,Do your research. Find out who is in charge of hiring and ask to speak to them directly before the interview. Find out what they expect from a candidate to see if you would be a good fit. Maybe hang out at the local bar near by and meet some of the people that work there. Never hurts to have an inside man or woman working in your favor to get you hired. Ask about the hiring agents hobbies and learn up on them so you can talk to them about shared interests. If you know your job then what‚Äôs most important now is knowing the people there and talking to them about things they like. The work is less important then the people you work with and work for. Perhaps address the quality of service you will provide to the customers. Making customers happy is also a good thing.
976,"Venezuela may be considered now a failing state. Despite Brazil‚Äôs current political and financial crisis, Venezuela‚Äôs 2016 GDP will be less than 10% of Brazil‚Äôs 2016 GDP.Venezuela is heavily dependent of it‚Äôs oil exports. Brazil also exports commodities like iron and cellulose, but has a much more developed economy, with dozens of automobile plants and other sophisticated industries. Embraer‚Äôs (a brazilian aerospace global player) revenues, as an example, are equivalent to 5% of Venezuela‚Äôs GDP. And the brazilian Petrobras revenues are almost the double of Venezuela GDP."
977,"Let's get to the root of this problem first. Why do you even feel inferior at all?You feel inferior, because society conditions us (women) to have pride in their looks and (men) in their money, which you don't have right now, by the general social standard.Admit it or not, this is the basic social conditioning since the inception of human society. Little emphasis is ever given to the intellect or empathy in a human, as the yardstick of social honour.Now, once you start to value your intellect, and the empathy‚Äîand if you think, you truly have some of these two qualities‚Äîyou won't feel inferior against anything or anyone.Because intellect and empathy are the prime reasons behind the evolution of human beings, into the topmost position within animal kingdom. Physical beauty or financial abundance did not save human beings from a tiger or crocodile in those prehistoric jungle days. Intellect did. It solved problems. Empathy did. It bonded the human beings together to form the society itself.That‚Äôs why, regarding the contribution to the human civilization, intellect and empathy played a much bigger role, than the prettiness and money playing today. So, if you possess them, you should be ethically proud. Not to feel inferior in any case.We feel inferior, when we feel we don't have something that the ohers have. Once you value what you already have, and when you discover the real worth of what you have, you won't feel lagging behind much, in the social competitions for ""honor"".That‚Äôs simple.Now, Here comes the universal monologue : ‚ÄúEasier said than done,friend.‚ÄùAlright.Remember the first day at school?Was it easy?Remember the first time when you were learning to write alphabet? A,B,C,D...The first mathematical lessons...how to multiply 56x78.First time you learned algebric expressions and solving equations..Was it easy?How many shots you had to take, just to write a single letter 'A', on paper, when you were just of age three? 100 shots were taken, after that you wrote: what looks like 'A' in some way. Then after 1 months of practice, you wrote--what you call ‚ÄòA‚Äô today. And now you are writing a whole sentence with 26 alphabets, in just 30 secs.So, if you look back now to those early days of learning how to write alphabet--can you even imagine, what a super improvement you have achieved?At your three year old, if I told you‚Äîhey you are going to write a whole english paragraph on Quora one day‚Äîwould you even believe me? At that time of first learning?Nothing is easy, at the start. Not even 2+2=4 is easy, when you first learned math. Multiplication tables of 9 and 7 were damn hard, when you first learned them.But now, you are a pro at this.Nobody has made you pro. It's you who did all the feat.What made you pro today? Even after repeated failure at that first day of math lesson.*Deliberate practice**And a little push for it everyday.* By our parents. Our school teachers etc.But after we cross 16-18, they stop pushing us, and let us grow in the manner as we wish.And, they expect, we will be able to push ourselves now.But, we don't push ourselves anymore. Instead, we get into a relaxed mode. The liberation mode. The freedom mode. Which kills our drive. The hunger to advance everyday. The hunger to try something new. Instead of becoming our own man, we become society's puppet.Then we say finally, as the society wants us to believe : easier said than done.Now, you may ask me : then, is everything is as easy as you seem to say?No.There is a strict classification in something which is easy, and which 'may' not be easy.Anything which is under your full control, is easy to initiate change.You want to change the country? Umm..not so easy may be. Success is not guaranteed.But you want to change yourself? Very easy. Just start. Success may be delayed, but guaranteed.You want your family to start something new..umm not easy.You yourself want to ..."

983,Is time travel possible or does it violate the law of conservation of energy by removing mass and energy from the present while adding it to the past?
984,"Sea breezes owe their existence to the different ways, land masses and the oceans heat up. Land will heat up to higher temperatures and quicker, while the water of the oceans requires much more energy to warm up - but holds it longer during night and into winter.Therefore, the ocean usually is warmest towards fall and coldest in spring. In winter, the sea is still relatively warm, while the land started to cool off since mid July. So in winter you have a very cold landmass next to a still rather warm ocean.The Sea Breeze usually kicks in in late morning, when the land has warmed up enough to be warmer than the ocean at the same time. It is strongest in early afternoon right after peak heating, then starts diminishing, as the water is getting a bit warmer and the land starts cooling off quickly.Now, during winter, the sun will heat the land only marginally or not at all, depending on how far north (or south) you are. It will not be enough to raise the land temperature above the sea temperature, and therefore no sea breeze can exist.Additionally to this lack of heating, there is also usually a lack of tranquil, high-pressure dominated weather in mid-latitude winter (around 45 degree north and south) In winter, you get frequent storm systems and cloud cover. If you have large windfields affecting your area at any given time, you will not see any local circulation systems such as the Sea Breeze.Further south, it is a different matter. You should be always able to see sea breezes around San Diego, California, even in January. The reason for this is that the deserts to the east of the coast will heat up readily into the mid seventies even in the dead of winter, whereas the waters off the southern California coast are pretty cold, due to a cold current from the north and upwelling from even colder water from the deep sea. Even in January, you get enough of a temperature difference to get the breeze going that brings those pesky fogs into the city. But even there you will see cold fronts and Santa Anas blowing through that interrupt this circulation.Still further south, on Mexico‚Äôs west coast, sea breezes are so strong, that in spring, when they are at their peak, you get your daytime high before noon. Land heats up into the low 100 ‚Äòs while the Pacific is in the low seventies. The resulting Sea ‚Äúwind‚Äù then brings that cool airmass onto the coast, cooling it down like A/C.So the larger the temperature difference between land and water is, the stronger the sea breeze gets. This is exemplified again in California, where they have a huge wind farm near Palm Springs, where you get daytime highs to around 120 F (49 o C) in summer while the Pacific battles to warm up above the mid sixties (around 18 degrees C) The wind blowing through the gap in the coast mountains there is permanent and very strong - during the day."

986,"i m a frequent Uber customer for past 3 + years , it has it own pros and cons .But never realized its just impossible to make uber hear your complaintsThis is about my experience with UBER on 2 April 20181. I booked uber pool from Sai Chowk ,kukreja furnishing 20.33 PM (Costing 49Rs)1.a . I received 1 call from the driver at 20.39 asking for directions after almost 1.11 sec of me explaining the directions ). The driver when to opposite direction), I called him again to confirm he blamed Google soon as i disconnected the phone he cancelled the trip.(I have the proof in video + app shows it)Fine, I tried booking another cab, unfortunately, trip when to the same driver.Episode 2 starts.2. Again the same thing, I called him 20.41 we again decided to meet at some location.2.a After waiting for another 10 -15mins+ 2 call to explain him the address he finally agreed to come.2.b As soon as I disconnected the phone he again cancelled the trip .( i was completely unaware of he called the trip,as the phone was in my pocket)And I found him on the way when waved he stopped and said ""He has not cancelled the trip it was due to the system error"" ,I showed him Uber has deducted money from me (In uber app).He also said its a system mistake and agreed to drop me.we reached the destination at around 21.10PM ,now the tantrum started.The driver again demanded 50rs , And refused to let me get out of the car without paying. I insisted on not paying and calling customer care .He refused to call ,Finally asked me to call the drivers' customer care number 020-33992233 (Call timing 21.17PM)Customer care executive tried explaining the driver about letting me go , but he denied (executive also tried explaining him the calculations but he was just not in a mood of listening) also abused your customer care executive.First call did not result in to anything, Driver was still asking me to pay for the trip( i have already paid for the trip twice, with out any mistake of mine ) he refused to let me get out of car when I tried to get out of car he started the car and moved it ahead making it impossible to get out)finally, i decided to call customer care again, the same number ( this time diver refused to talk to Uber executive).When i tried to explain the situation of executive he refused to listen to me as i was a customer( i was actually hostage for good 20min for no fault of mine). and after that he started the verbal abuse, I have a video recording of his behavior with me (attached with this emaill) .Finally, i forced my way out of his car and came home.There are serious security questions here1. I was not allowed to get out of the car , for not paying extra money.2. I was charged 42.23 rs for the trips cancelled by a driver , Why I m charged for trips cancelled by the driver ( i have claimed this amount back from app )I need answers to following concerns1. What is ideally expected from the uber customer at this point.2. What action Uber will take on this driverafter reaching Uber from uber app , i got typical reply saying we will keep driver under surveillance for few days if this happens again we will take action . after producing all the proofs video + call records uber just give taking it too lightly ,are they waiting for Big mishap to happen ?"

988,"Agile ModelBefore going further, there is one question that comes to our minds.what do we mean by the word Agile.Agile is something which is quick and easy. Similarly when we talk about Software Development, Agile is referred to a task division into various phases of work and frequent reassessment and make changes as per the requirements during the Software Development. Below are the main advantages of using the Agile:1. CostUsing the incremental nature of Agile methodology provides one of the great benefits which means that features are delivered in short increments, thus enabling some of the benefits to be released early while the product continues to develop. Which also means that customer does not have to wait longer to see the whole product.2. QualityKey principle of agile development is that testing continues to happen throughout the software development, enabling testers to keep a regular eye on the working product. This continues testing process results in better results of the overall product.3. VisibilityIn Agile development process, active ‚Äòuser‚Äô is closely involved throughout the product‚Äôs development which leads to a good collaborative approach from both the ends. This involvement provides an excellent visibility to the stakeholders, which in turn helps to ensure that expectations are effectively managed and in case there is any deviation from the requirements, it can be detected on early stages to make the changes.4. Risk ManagementSmall incremental releases makes the product more visible to the product owner and product team. This also helps to identify the issues at early stages and make it easier for the developer to apply the changes. The clear visibility to the product owner ensures that any necessary decisions can be taken care off at the earliest possible time frame which saves the product before it goes out in the market.5.FlexibilityAs we know that change is the only constant as one thing which is certain in life is only change. Similarly, agile provides us this flexibility to make the changes as per the upcoming trends during the software development cycle. In agile development, change is accepted at all the stages of development.Scrum ModelScrum model is a smaller part of Agile. It is a process framework for agile development, and the most widely-used in software development.Scrum is most often used to manage complex software and product development, using the iterative practice. Scrum mainly increases the overall productivity. Using the Scrum method processes, it becomes easier for the organizations to adapt smoothly with the rapidly-changing requirements, and thus produce a product that meets all the business goals. An agile Scrum process benefits the organization in following manner:Increased quality of the productAdjust better with changes (and expect the changes)Provide better estimates of the productMore control of the projectI hope that above provided information helped you in gaining more knowledge about Agile ans Scrum models. Being in a qa services organization, I have tried my best to share the actual facts with you.Thanks,Anand"

But it does not mean that one cant benefit from this medicine also it is worth mentioning that it has almost non possible side effects thus it is quite safe to use.In the past it was available on Ebay but now Ebay is actively deleting these listings.Potential users in US has to rely to overseas vendors and the best way is to buy from Latvian vendor since it is the country of origin.The biggest manufacturer is Grindeks.

991,"I saw this picture a while back on my social media and thought that it would be perfect for a question like this. (although some aspects of this are slightly untrue)Nazi GermanyTroops: Some of the best trained men in the war. They were know for their extreme discipline and respect to authority and custom. Engagements with Nazis were rarely ever an easy fight.Production: Germany still to this day is revered as a nation of engineers. Infact, they often had a habit of over engineering things. They had freaking crazy tanks and aircraft, but these were often hard to repair in the field due to their complexity. The average everyday mechanic would struggle.Their engineering was so good, in fact, that they actually invented the concept of stealth bombing (although never actually tested it in flight)(Replica of Nazi blueprints for the ‚ÄúWing Plane‚Äù)USATroops: As listed above, they were known for their unpredictability. Unpredictability can be taken the wrong way if you aren‚Äôt careful. What this means, is that American troops were remarkably flexible. Individual officers could easily change the method of attack of their men. This made the Americans hard to predict. The US also intentionally made machines easy to fix, easy enough where any guy with a hammer could fix them.Production: The US had the strongest economy at the time. They utilized the competition and intuition of the free market to create some of the most insane weapons ever in MASSIVE quantities (Boeing B-29s, P-51Ds, Atomic Bombs, ect‚Ä¶) The free market also gave America HUGE supplies of everything. Germans would often comment on how they would see American troops with just piles and piles of everything.(B-29, extreme high-altitude bomber, in mass production)USSRTroops: Hardened, but poorly trained and terribly equipped. The USSR would often just send in waves after waves of men. The amount of casualties were devastating. Russia is often criticized for their lack of value for human life. Sometimes soldiers were tossed into battles with no rifle and told ‚ÄúWhen the man in front of you dies, grab his‚Äù.Production: The depression was kicking Russia‚Äôs ass. Socialism wasn‚Äôt helping. The soviets were often deprived of food and supplies, so early on in the war, America sent some P-40s (planes) over to help them. The Russian pilots actually did pretty well though, earning multiple ‚ÄúAce‚Äù pilots on these planes.(Russian Troops)JapanTroops: The most motivated in the entire war. They based their military discipline off of the ‚ÄúBushido Code‚Äù which stated that anyone who surrenders doesn‚Äôt deserve to live. (this also explains terrible treatments of both US and Chinese POWs‚Äù This is also the exact reason why the US dropped the bombs. Pres. Truman knew this. He thought that the Japanese would fight until every old man, child, and woman had died. They would fight down to to their teeth and nails.Production: Light but maneuverable. Their planes, especially the Zero, were known to be extremely quick and agile, but very easy to destroy once hit. Their production almost entirely stopped due to American B-29 bombings on their factories. This lack of production and Bushido Code explains Kamikaze bombers. People willing to commit suicide to sink a single ship for their nation. And lack of planes to do a whole, formal formation.I could go further, but it‚Äôs 12:00 am where I live, and I have school tomorrow.:D Hope you all enjoyed reading!!EDIT- See those lats two bullet points?

993,"It happened back in 2002 . I don‚Äôt know what should I call it a ghostly experience or a paranormal.From Kolhapur, we were heading to a village called Guhagar. The road was narrow and going through hilly area. It was around 9 pm. We were riding a Yamaha RX100 bike.It was going to take another couple of hours to reach to the destination.A road was something like this.We decided to wait for a while to smoke. As it was dark and hilly area, we decided to stop for a very short time. We found a mile stone which stated that we are still 59 kms. away from the destination.We stopped and my friend smoked (I don‚Äôt smoke). I told my friend to drive bit faster so that we can reach sooner and find a hotel to stay.We started again, after driving for another half an hour in almost straight direction, my friend suddenly stopped the bike. I asked him the reason.He said ‚ÄúAbhi, did you notice something ?‚ÄùMe :- No, what is it ?Him :- Isn‚Äôt it the same place we stopped half an hour ago ?I noticed the same mile stone and cigarette stub he smoked.Shit ! What is this ? We did not take a turn, we were driving in a straight direction. Now it was almost 09:45 and we are still 59 kms away from the destination.A cold wave ran through my spine, I hastily ran towards bike and asked my friend to start it and leave this place ASAP.Now, we were still to face the nightmare.Again after driving for 20‚Äì25 minutes we reached to the same spot.Oh my god ! What‚Äôs going on ? We were driving like in circle and reaching no where. We did not understand that without taking a turn or riding in circular direction, how we reached to the same spot twice ?It was too creepy.We prayed and begged for mercy to the lord. And started again, miraculously, we reached to the destination after an hour and half.Next morning I spoke with some local guys about this, they said that many people have experienced it at the same spot where we did.I don‚Äôt know what that was, but surely creepy one though !*****Edit 1On the way back, I curiously looked for the same mile stone to figure out whether it was done as a mischief by someone. But I could only find one mile stone."

A middlemen arranged for high-scoring students to impersonate applicants during the exams, while paying officials and invigilators to look the other way. Type 2: In these cases, invigilators were bribed to allow certain applicants to sit next to impersonators so they could cheat easily.Type 3: In such instances, applicants apparently left their answer sheets blank, to be filled up later on the basis of the marks they were given.The result is common - To get fake doctors [imagine 2000 fake doctors in your city, will you take your kid to hospital? do you have any other option?It's a massive scam worth¬† approx some $1 billion (Rs6,300 crore) and include every one from students their parents, middlemen and lower officials, and political parties, some very shocking news came in Feb 2014""Chauhan involved in Vyapam scam; Kin of staff of RSS chief got job: Katare"" - http://www.freepressjournal.in/c...

998,"I have not come across earth based Gamma ray telescopes.Cosmic rays (made mostly of protons 90% and alpha particles - 9%) are mostly created by supernovas, and sometimes by jets from blazars (active galactic neuclii -AGNs, whose polar jets are pointed at the Earth.) These are hard enough to detect; Cosmic rays will be absorbed by planets - with very little collateral radiation bounced off (and that too in the Gamma range). So it is highly unlikely to receive gamma rays reflected by an exoplanet with enough intensity to be able to detect it on earth.Regarding gamma ray reflections -Since cosmic rays are relatively rare, but a cosmic ray bust can be detected in a multi-square km area, Crayfis has been arming smartphones w/ cameras with an app for detecting cosmic rays: https://crayfis.io/about.It would probably be interesting to turn some datacenters (especially academic and government funded labs) into detectors as well, after all, neutrons in alpha particles in cosmic rays have been attributed to cause memory bit flips (leading to the use of ECC and interleaved memory.)"
999,"The Blue Hole near Danhub is very dangerous for a number of reasons.Firstly it has a lot of traffic. If you said that diving or deep diving carried a risk, and gave it a value, the chance of something going wrong is that probability multiplied by the number of dives. Even really safe sites can record fatalities if there are sufficient dives there.The other issues with the site are related to water depth, clarity and the famous arch.With water depth there can be problems with nitrogen narcosis and at depths approaching 60 metres problems with oxygen toxicity. Deep water is very appealing to some people. I am sure we all know divers who want to be the deepest person on a dive. Sadly it doesn't matter how tough you are, depth will always win.Water clarity and depth together is a problem. Clear water can make things closer, smaller and generally more accessible. I remember the first few times I was in really clear deep water, I found myself looking at something below and seemingly in no time I was right on top of it having descended another 15 or 20m. I was at that time a very experienced diver regularly diving to 50m and had I not been so conditioned might have been in some bother. It was both surprising and potentially dangerous to have found myself being drawn in like that. The Blue Hole has great visibility and sufficient depth that people might easily find themselves deeper and more narcotised than expected and I have seen people dangerously narcotised at quite modest depths. People do odd things when they are narcotised. I have seen people getting disorientated in terms of direction and bolting into deeper water rather than heading up, taking their regulator out of their mouth etc Seriously narcotised people have a fair chance of not making it back to the surface.The final lure in the Blue Hole is the arch. It is quite deep, longer than it looks with a current flowing through it. It isn't totally straightforward to find. Many people have reported having near death experiences trying to negotiate it. It seems to be on the list if must-do activities for heros going to the Blue Hole. It may also be one of the elements that lures divers beyond their ability.The accessibility of the site, it's depth, clarity and the lure of the arch has led to estimates of deaths anywhere from 40 to 200 in the last 40 years"

1001,"I teach swimming from six months up to adulthood. Even though I teach parent-child classes because I cannot choose which classes I will and will not teach at my facilities, I do not recommend them. ‚ÄúLearn to swim‚Äù courses are very subtly different from ‚ÄúParent-and-child aquatics‚Äù in that swimming strokes are really not taught at this level. It is really about getting comfortable in the water and bonding with the parents; the education is geared toward the parent so that they can encourage their child to learn.My suggestion is for parents (I am assuming parents who swim, not non-swimmers themselves) to skip this class and opt for spending time with their children in the water with them, showing them that you enjoy the water and care that they have fun in it too. It does not matter what you do with them; if you want an agenda, parent-child classes are essentially kicking on the front and back, trailing them behind you to let them glide, trying to blow bubbles, trying to paddle the hands. As long as they are getting comfortable in the water, they are accomplishing the goals of this class.(In Red Cross, there are overlaps between the levels. For example, someone who did Preschool classes might skip Learn-to-Swim level 1 onto level 2, as learn-to-swim starts with the same skills but at a school-age.)So I‚Äôd aim for 3‚Äì4 years old, skipping infancy onto the preschool years."

1004,"That depends on a lot of factors and many possible scenarios.The most common cause is the operator. Get someone who actually knows what they are doing and things may start working again.Another possible cause could be a blown speaker. A blown voice coil can short circuit or have much lower impedance.Another possible cause could be improper speaker connection and/or a set of speakers that do not match the amp impedance limit. Too many loudspeakers connected to the same channel, will do the trick if not properly connected in a series/parallel setup that will keep the impedance within the amps limit.Another probable cause could be ‚Äúclipping‚Äù a form of distortion that will eventually blow the loudspeaker coils and after the amp end stage. Or when the amp has Clipping protection circuit.Another possible scenario could be heat. Improper amp ventilation can do the trick too (provided the amp has thermal protection circuit)Another possible scenario would be ‚Äúamp starvation‚Äù. Improper power supply and grounding can do the trick.Another possible scenario could be faulty components in the amp either on the power supply or the end stage or bothThere are plenty of possible scenarios and it is difficult to point out one with the very small info you have on your answer.

1007,"Here is the state of the world now (only highlights).North Korea- Has missiles and Nukes in its stockpile. Their missiles do not have enough range to reach continental US. Even if they somehow manage to strike a few Nukes at the US, it will only affect the impact zones immediately. So it will result in the total wipe out of NK in the US‚Äôs retaliation. North does not want to nuke the south coz their first goal is to take over the south and unite the Koreas. It does not want to attack any of its neighbors simply because there are no compelling reasons to do so for North. So there‚Äôs no real threat.Russia- She has a lot of technologically advanced weapons. Some even better than the US. She has a stock pile of Nukes and intercontinental ballistic missiles. But they have one thing working against them. Their own economy. Their economy is weak. They cannot keep the supplies alive to support an all out war or an invasion. No place can be dominated or occupied without boots on the ground. So there‚Äôs no real threat.China- She has the largest army. Lot of hardware, strong economy, many missiles and long history as well. What is working against them is their size and their political leadership. Most of the weapons in their arsenal are old and reverse engineered stuff from the Soviet era. They are modernizing however, but not at the rates they want. Also their navy and air force does not have enough hardware to back an invasion. So no real threat.India- Certainly a large number of people, large army. Relatively modern Air force and Navy. India is historically peaceful and non-aggressive they have stood their ground against aggressors but never pushed back. Also the air force does not have the infrastructure to support an invasion. Navy has inadequate number of modern vessels. Submarine fleet is aging. Modernization is happening at a snail‚Äôs pace. Political leadership is not helping with the process either. So no real threat.Europe- Collectively, very powerful and has strategic advantage over the rest of the world due to sheer strength and size of hardware of individual members and the collective strategic knowledge and experience. However, Europe is not as united as they wish to be. Member nations have trust issues with each other due to leftover emotions from previous two world wars. Also there is an impending financial crisis and a social crisis due to the refugee movement. So no real threat.Africa-Individual nations(some of them) may be strong enough to defend own territories against invaders, however none of the African nations are strong enough to launch a war or an invasion against even their Asian neighbors; let alone European or American. Also, most of the continent is torn apart by countless civil wars, racial and tribal conflicts and regional disputes. There is not enough reasons for an outward spill-over of the conflicts. So no real threat.South America- Same as Africa. Third world countries, slow or crippled economies, poverty, smaller, largely inadequate military forces. There are no compelling reasons for them to cause a large scale conflict, let alone global. So no real threat.Middle East- There are a few who can put up a real tough fight against an invading foreign military.Their situational awareness, familiarity with terrain and guerrilla tactics are all advantageous but only works withing the region so they are only good at defense. Certain countries possess good hardware and moderately large modern armed forces. However, none of the Middle Eastern countries possess the military strength to lead an invasion on foreign land or sustain the defense of their own territories for a long time (including Iran). Also they are not synonymous with the modern equipment that they possess. This is because of lack of experience in large scale multi-face, multi-theater warfare and lack of trust between troops. This seriously undermines the collective efforts. So no real threat.Last but not least,USA- Uncle Sam checks off all items on the list when it comes to size, numbers and weaponry. Certainly strong, economy wise. Has a global reach and has lead countless invasions, successfully. They are already the dominating force and has a firm hand of control over the world with many military bases in strategic locations across the entire planet. She is ruling the world now, at least by a big margin (Economically, politically and strategically). So she wouldn‚Äôt do anything that would start a third world war and cause a global meltdown. Because once the world goes in to the chaos of war, the balance of power might tip against them. Off course she will get involved in many other small scale conflicts, trying to bring down a dictatorship or install a new one, home-delivering freedom and democracy to the needful. Still, no real threat.Unless something dramatic plays out anytime soon or some nut job decides to let some nukes loose willy-nilly, we are certainly not heading towards a third world war. So just relax and have a cold beer."

1010,"Binary search trees are collections that can efficiently maintain a dynamically changing dataset in sorted order, for some ""sortable"" type.*Having a sorted array is useful for many tasks because it enables binary search to be used to efficiently locate elements. The problem with a sorted array is that elements can't be inserted and removed efficiently.The binary search tree is a different way of structuring data so that it can still be binary searched (or a very similar procedure can be used), but it's easier to add and remove elements. Instead of just storing the elements contiguously from least to greatest, the data is maintained in many separate chunks, making adding an element a matter of adding a new chunk of memory and linking it to existing chunks.Binary search trees support everything you can get from a sorted array: efficient search, in-order forward/backwards traversal from any given element, predecessor /successor element search, and max /min queries, with the added benefit of efficient inserts and deletes. With a self-balancing binary search tree (BST), all of the above run in logarithmic time.* It can store any type that has a total order defined on it. A total order means a binary comparison operation between elements has been defined, and the elements can be arranged in a unique sequence from smallest to greatest based on this operation. For example, integers or reals with the typical (""natural"") order."

The modern Thaat system was created by Pt. Vishnu Narayan Bhatkhande (1860-1936), one of the most influential musicologists of Hindustani Classical Music. According to Pt. Bhatkhande, each one of the several traditional Raagas is based on, or is a variation of, ten basic Thaats.These ten thaats are Bilawal, Kalyan, Khamaj, Bhairav, Poorvi, Marwa, Kafi, Asavari, Bhairavi and Todi.Raag or Raaga:The melody with an overall mood or environment producing a lasting impression while entertaining or recreating the audience.

1013,"Many have taken the view of Hardy that ‚Äúmathematical reality lies outside of us, that our function is to discover or observe it, and that the theorems which we prove, and which we describe grandiloquently as our ‚Äòcreations,‚Äô are simply our notes of our observations.‚Äú This makes mathematics sounds like a science studying the natural world, and certainly we often speak of mathematical objects as it they are real objects that exist somewhere, but this view introduces the very hard questions of where does this mathematical reality exist and why is it that logical proof is our means of observing it.Others, especially more recently, have argued that mathematics is less like the natural sciences and more like the arts; that is, mathematical theorems aren‚Äôt discovered, they‚Äôre invented. This allows us to understand Weierstrass‚Äôs statement that ‚Äúthe true mathematician is a poet.‚Äù While capturing the sense of creativity present in producing modern mathematics, the idea that mathematics is entirely a human construct faces some serious challenges which are well communicated by Eugene Wigner in his remarkable paper, The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Mathematics in the Natural Sciences. If mathematics is a human creation, why does it do such a stellar job at describing the many diverse phenomena of the natural world? I find the idea of a garden very helpful. A garden is both discovered and created. The plants present existed in nature already, but the way in which they are brought together, arranged, and cultivated reflects the human gardeners.A similar story can be told of mathematics: we begin with ideas that appear very naturally within nature, then, as rational beings, we interact with creation by rationally extending these ideas.Perhaps, as has been said before, ""God gave us the integers, all the rest is the work of man."" Wherever you draw the line, it seems that parts of math (say, arithmetic) are in some sense forced upon us from the natural world, while there remains the clear sense that human freedom and creativity are involved as we handle and extend these ideas.Now, I believe Wigner was right that there remains a mystery here. Why are we able to handle these ideas in a way that doesn't lead us into a web of contradiction? Moreover, why does it remain useful in describing the natural world after human creativity has clearly had its role? For instance, the introduction of imaginary numbers were simply to satisfy the curiosity of mathematicians, and yet many have argued that modern physics cannot be formulated without imaginary numbers. We just thought them up, but they very well may be essential to understand the universe. Many other such examples abound, such as non-Euclidean geometry.It must be that just as we are deeply curious and creative, we are also deeply mathematical. And so is the universe."
1014,"L. Ron Hubbard was an unsuccessful sci-fi writer who was on record as saying ‚ÄúYou don't get rich writing science fiction. If you want to get rich, you start a religion.‚Äù - interesting, then, that he went on to start a religion and get rich.He also invented a device to find out if tomatoes feel pain, that device evolved into the e-meter which Scientology uses to carry out ‚Äúpsychological evaluations‚Äù, known as ‚Äúauditing"", on its victims. Oops, sorry, did I say victims? I meant followers.Scientology is known to charge immense amounts of money for its so-called spiritual enlightenment, it is known to use followers as little more than slaves (paying less than subsistence wages for immense hours of work), it determines which of its members may marry which and which may have children - this isn't me making shit up, this is me repeating what a large number of people who left the church have said. Hundreds if not thousands of people independently telling almost identical stories of abuse. Even Jenna Miscavige, the daughter of this alleged church's post-Hubbard leader David Miscavige, escaped the church and told of the horrors inside Scientology.Those who do leave and tell such tales are routinely subjected to psychological bullying and blackmail, often using personal info gleaned during ‚Äúauditing‚Äù, which is their term for a so-called psychological consultation using a tomato scream recorder, sorry, wrong words again, I meant to say an e-meter.Scientology hates being investigated, many investigators and journalists who have tried are routinely subjected to the same bullying that church leavers undergo.Finally, despite denying that they are a cult, Scientologists echo one of the most common cult behaviours: seeking to separate followers from the two groups of people who might see what is going on and lure the followers out of the church, namely their family members who are outside the church, and psychologists.If there was ever a perfect recipe for bullshit, it would read like a check-list of facts about Scientology."

But when i came back to my home, my father was there too with my mom, he told me he has a job offer for me at his friend's office but i have to get that position by passing through intelligent test and interview, i was a brilliant student and organizer. I did because i was hurt enough to get anything from my father but job. it was a new thing for me to take orders from others and work accordingly and face many type of behaviors of my colleagues, many o them thought i got appointed because of my dad ""favoritism, you know"". anyway in start it was strange and paining, most of the time i coursed my parents but after one and half year i realized how much business dealing and marketing potential i possessed to hold a company and new projects. My father was right i wasn't using my real potential while working with him but when i beg 3 new projects in raw for my company without anyone's help i came to know the level of work i could do, now i am again working with my father's company but with much better position (my father is now just a part of company board). much successful and moreover i know how to treat people to get work done and where to behave in which way to turn things in my favor. So i suggest you. Just send him to get a job experience with your rivals and competitors. He will become what you want to see him.  "

1018,"I see from the answers already here that there is ambiguity about what heat capacity refers to. Everyone agrees about specific heat. My own connotation of heat capacity is that is is the amount of heat needed to raise the temperature of an object by one degree. Specific heat would be the heat capacity divided by the mass of the object. So the two things have different units.Heat capacity is in, for example, J/KSpecific heat would be in J/kg-KThis link (heat capacity | physics) agrees with my interpretation, although it uses calories per gram instead of joules per kilogram. But conceptually these are the same.If you use the expression ‚Äúheat capacity‚Äù I suggest making it clear which interpretation you mean in order to avoid the ambiguity. If you said ‚Äúheat capacity of this substance‚Äù that would clearly mean specific heat, and if you said ‚Äútotal heat capacity of this object‚Äù that would also be fairly unambiguous, but if you said ‚Äúheat capacity of this object‚Äù it might be interpreted by the listener as either.

1022,"Well, if you are looking to master your English grammar, then take out atleast 15 minutes to read the following post about how you can actually start to speak and write in English.Yes, by the time, you will read the post, your basics will be clear to a great extent, provided that you show seriousness.English is important in any field. So, if you are the masters in it, then potentially you can reach the zenith earlier, as compared to others. Therefore, it is important to polish skills.In the following article, I am sharing my experiences of how I mastered over this language in a full fledged way along with giving easy and practical steps which will help bloggers towards polishing the same as well.My passion for enhancing English skills grew from my childhood days as I was in early years of my schooling. Till I was in class 6th, my English was not even upto the mark then. I used to get punishment from teachers as well as parents for failing to get requisite marks in any subject and English was not an exception.Also read : How to get bank Jobs fast after 12th and Graduation in Govt or Pvt sectorHowever, soon I got counseling from one of my uncles who equally happened to be a HOD in Government Polytechnic. He is a really nice man. I must say. He gave me enough reasons to polish my English, since all other subjects are primarily based on English as well. So, if I will improve my English, I can equally be able to have a better control over other subjects too. That was the day which proved to be a change for me.Although, I was able to understand to what others used to speak, yet I couldn‚Äôt communicate with them in English and I believe that most of us face such predicament. Isn‚Äôt it?You might not believe that it was the reality that I used to bring all the English dailies in the morning such as ‚ÄúTimes of India‚Äù, ‚ÄúHindustan Times‚Äù, ‚ÄúPioneer‚Äù and the list goes on and on.I am telling from my own personal experience that the difference which I found in these English newspapers is that ‚ÄúPioneer‚Äù offers comparably easy use of words. Therefore, initially, I would recommend this newspaper for those who want to learn skills of English. Because, when I say easy use of words, I mean as compared to other English dailies.I used to closely monitor the words which my teachers use. More so, when it comes to English subject, I used to learn a lot many words. I still remember that I learnt the word ‚ÄúEnthusiasm‚Äù and the way it should be used.Read : How to polish English skills ‚Äì Third PostIf you though that by learning words, you can use them also, then you are wrong. Since, you have to use them at their appropriate place at their appropriate form. For example,How enthusiasm and happiness can be used. Lets find out.I am enthusiasm or I am happiness (wrong)I am an enthusiastic person (used as adjective) (or if we want to use the word ‚ÄúEnthusiasm‚Äù then we can sayI am full of enthusiasm (used as noun)I am happy (used as noun)I am full of happiness (used as adjective)I can‚Äôt go in detail about whole grammar in the post though. But can help you out, if you have any queries.I equally persuaded my uncle to give tuitions to me of English and he obliged. He made it a point of giving an ‚ÄúEssays‚Äù and ‚ÄúLetters‚Äù to write on daily basis which I have to complete anyhow and show to him the next evening. My passion started growing when I started seeing the pleasant change.When I used to read newspapers, I made it a point of writing the words which I did not know the meaning of. That gave me enough reasons to strengthen my vocabulary as well. How can I miss watching English news channels? As I said that it became my passion, so I used to get enjoyment by watching news channels and I equally used to closely monitor the way certain words were pronounced. Since, that‚Äôs equally matter as well.Read : How to polish your English- Third postI made it a point to listen news wit..."
1023,"So its 25 December, day of Christmas and few days before NEW YEAR.Movie launched on the silver screens just at the right time. Yes out of all the Bollywood movies I saw this year, this movie really comes under a category to be appreciated .2016 was a year of BIOPICS!!! yes Sarbajit, M.S Dhoni and now DANGAL.I am not a movie critic but as an honest viewer I rate this movie 9/10.Yes I am rating it a bit high, but it deserves this score.I would like to list out the points I loved while watching this piece of cinematography.Starting from the starting, I loved the simple things shown in the movie, like a person adjusting the antenna to catch the signals, it reminded of the my childhood days.Best part is the narration in the movie, yes I fell in love with this idea of the director.The actor playing the dangal sister‚Äôs cousin have done a stupendous work.This movie exactly portraits how people in India in fact families are entangled in love,the care of her mother the sacrifices made by all the people around to help the girls grow.This movie is a combination of good jokes at times and full of emotional moments.The movie keeps your mind and heart intact till the end. One does not even loose interest after intermission.I loved the each and every small details displayed on the screen, like the house they live in, the attires worn by the cast. Yes the director looked into every small details.And yes this movie is not a waste of money at all.This movie is very inspiring if one tends to get inspired from the DANGAL SISTER‚ÄôS.The songs are apt to the script. And dialogues written are too good.I guess I need no points to mention about Aamir Khan, his performance is as usual the best one gets to see once at the end of year.I loved the subject that how difficult it is for the father to be coach and parent at the same time.‚Äú Well, people still planning to watch this movie go out spend a little and watch it on a big screen.‚Äù‚ÄúPAISA WASOOL MOVIE HAI‚ÄùI wish we get to see such movies in 2017 also :P"

1025,"Nothing but anger and rage goes through their mind according to several of my clients. It is sad when you see that so many of these people controlled their anger at the people that upset them, their bosses, other employees, their parents or some friend. Then they go home mad or get mad at just about anything and explode on their significant other.I‚Äôve heard several answers why they feel they can hold it till they get to their significant other. I‚Äôve heard that they maight get fired if it was at work. (Which is ridiculous that someone can plan to get mad at a person in particular every time they get mad. That shows some choices and self control). Another answer is that the other person should know what is expected. If we could be God to know every need and thing that the other person needs. Let alone, that some people come home just to explode or wait for the other person to say or even look wrong at that person. There are some people who fly off the handle with anyone too. I just see more people who choose to only abuse their significant others.No one should take it. It‚Äôs sad because I‚Äôve seen people who were advocates for the people being abused, and then turn around and get into the same position later on. They know the signs. We can become blind when it comes to our selves.That is why we should be aware, observe and inform someone if we see this happening to them. It really helps when the abuser only hurts one person. That is when it shows they are controlling who they hurt. The victims usually realize it at this point when they are reminded."

When someone follows you they get updated with your activity which is set to Public, if the user isn't in your friends list then they get very few updates like, if you've liked some pages, posts, commented on public pages, updated status ""set to Public"" these are the few things they get notified. If someone from your friend's list follows you, they get notified if you've new friends, if you've commented on your friend's posts, if you've liked someone's status, you almost get all the notifications except secure things which includes if you've sent messages, sent friend requests etc.If you want to stop your friends or other people to get notified with your activity then you just need to turn of the follow feature.

1030,"Not really. For example, I am ‚Äúlegally blind‚Äù meaning that I have a corrected visual acuity of 20/200 in the better eye and a visual field of less than 20 degrees.I can read the computer screen, but I cannot see faces. I can walk with a cane, but I cannot drive. Total blindness is not as rare as all that, but it is not common either. Many blind and legally blind persons have some sight, such as the ability to see shapes and colors, but without enough clarity to read. Others might see clearly and sharply, but only a tiny pinhole of vision, so that they must read (if they can) one l___e___t___t___e___r______a___t______a______t___i___m___eand some can only see faint shadows of grey on black with only vague light perception.An explanation of the numbers here‚Ä¶ 20/20 is normal vision. You can see, at 20 feet, what nearly everybody can at 20 feet. 20/200 means that what normally sighted persons can see at two hundred feet away, I must get up to twenty feet to see. You might br able to read a street sign at the end of the block, from the *other* end. I need to get up to the base of the pole the sign is on.There is also ‚Äúprosopagnosia‚Äù or ‚ÄúFace blindness‚Äù I believe that it is caused by an injury to the brain *or* a blind infant passing the ‚Äúwindow‚Äù of time in which they learn to recognize faces. As a newborn, I spent two months or more sealed in an incubator, with masked nurses caring for me. There is a neurological ‚Äúlearning window‚Äù of time in which an infant learns that two dots, a line and a curved line are a ‚Äúface‚Äù :-D and they learn that faces represent people. Mommy‚Äôs face is not Daddy‚Äôs face. Sister‚Äôs face looks different than Granny‚Äôs face. I never got that. All faces were amorphous blurs, and the masks they wore prevented me from seeing more than just eyes. Fuzzily, at that. As a child, once I was able to talk, I consistently referred to EVERYONE as ‚Äúmommy‚Äù because I had NO idea that there were *different* people. I thought I was seeing only one or two persons and that was all there was! It wasn‚Äôt until I got my glasses at age 3 or 4 that I realized that there were many many people! But they all had the same face. Sadly, to this day, I fail miserably at identifying celebrities. So there are as many differences in blindness, legal blindness and impaired vision, as you can imagine."

For example, throw a coin. What is the probability that it will land at all? That it will always land?I'd just give 1 for both and call it a day. You probably don't know mathematical notation that could express the infinitesimal slightness of the chance of the coin never landing."
1033,"Social Anxiety is the worst nightmare for any person having it.You get a phone call, you panic.Somebody knocks on the door, you panic.The teacher asks a question in class, you panic.The cashier asks you for card/money, you sweat.The waiter asks you for order, you panic.You talk to people other than your family/closest friends, your lips quiver.Visiting doctors, gives you chills.When you leave home, a mountain of discomfort and self-consciousness sits on your head.You do not like to go alone anywhere because all attention will be on you(you hate being the center of attention).You don‚Äôt like to eat in front of people or do anything which may cause others to look at you.You dress simple and put very little makeup so that people don‚Äôt stare at you.You are hesitant to ask people for help.When you are around people, you feel very self conscious about your dress, your look, your talking style, your walking style etc.At college, even though you may be very intelligent and hard working, your scores will go low just because of seminars and presentations.Your heart starts racing, hands and legs start shivering, lips start quivering, body starts sweating, you are unable to talk or breathe properly when you face a crowd whether or not you are expected to speak(The crowd can be as low as 5 people).You overthink each and every conversation(many times) and become depressed.The more you try to control your anxiety, the more it haunts you.You may be creative, logical, honest; your vocabulary may be excellent, your sense of humor may be fabulous, but when the time comes to talk, it looks as though you have very poor communication skills.You may not be able to make friends and may eventually be depressed.You may not talk much to your relatives, which will create distance.You may be very talented, but are afraid to show your talents.You may be a very loving and caring person, but fail to express your emotions.You might want to see a psychiatrist who might help you to overcome your social anxiety, but you don‚Äôt go to him because you have social anxiety(LOL!!)It becomes your biggest hurdle on the way of success, love, career, education etc :(You write this answer anonymously because people may judge you. And you read it many times before hitting submit.All these points may differ from person to person(and with different intensity).

1034,"Shortly after discovering she was expecting her second child with rapper T.I., former Xscape member Tameka ‚ÄòTiny‚Äô Cottle was faced with the heartbreaking news that her pregnancy check-up had raised a red flag.In a new interview with Essence.com, Tiny opens up about her pregnancy struggles, sharing that the sac that held her baby girl ‚Äúwas split in two and they had not combined by the time she had turned 16 weeks old.‚Äù With her daughter ‚Äúpositioned in the middle of those two sacs in her own sac,‚Äù Tiny was told to prepare for the ‚Äúpossibility that [the baby] could get tied up in her umbilical cord.‚ÄùDespite the doctor‚Äôs warnings, according to Tiny, the thought of losing the baby never crossed her mind. In fact, says the singer, her doctors informed her that all was well with her baby, as things seemed to be under control. A trip to the specialist the following day however, proved otherwise. ‚ÄúWhen I went to see the specialist, that‚Äôs when they determined there was no heartbeat,‚Äù explains Tiny, who delivered her stillborn daughter six months into the pregnancy.Surrounded by family and friends to avoid her mind from wandering and being ‚Äúso sad,‚Äù both Tiny ‚Äî who found herself ‚Äúvery upset and depressed for awhile‚Äù ‚Äî and T.I. spent the hours after the birth in the hospital room with their daughter Leyah Amore.For the devastated mother, the idea of leaving the hospital without her baby girl was understandably hard to swallow. ‚ÄúHere I am in the hospital to have a baby, deliver it, but I‚Äôm going to go home with no baby,‚Äù says Tiny, who admits she continues to ‚Äúkeep [Leyah‚Äôs] belongings near me ‚Äî pictures and roses [from the burial].‚Äù While the songstress realizes that her form of grieving may seem ‚Äúcrazy‚Äù to others, she ‚Äújust needed to be with‚Äù her baby girl.‚ÄúAfter Leyah was born, I kept her in the room with me the whole day. They placed her in the little basket and we dressed her in an outfit and had a blanket wrapped around her. They came and got her because her body went cold and I wanted her back so they warmed her body again and I kept her. Everybody came to visit her and then me and [T.I.] had our time alone with her.‚ÄùContinue reading for more on Leyah and the unexpected turn the couple‚Äôs relationship took.While the family held a ‚Äúbeautiful‚Äù funeral service for Leyah, Tiny admits she rarely visits the gravesite ‚Äî apart from ‚Äúholidays and special days‚Äù ‚Äî as the memories leave her ‚Äútoo sad.‚Äù Despite the heartache and immense grief from the loss of their daughter, Tiny and T.I. found their greatest comfort in each other, eventually announcing their second engagement. Tiny ‚Äî whose ‚Äúexperience taught me not to take life for granted‚Äù ‚Äî shares that the tragedy surrounding their daughter ‚Äúdefinitely brought us closer in our relationship.‚ÄùIn addition to Leyah, the couple are also parents to Clifford ‚ÄòKing‚Äô Harris III, 4, and Major Harris, 9 months.

1035,"If you can learn to program or already know how to program, then you can try to do some ‚Äúdry science‚Äù by writing some computer codes to analyze biological data. I suggest this because ultimately it only requires a computer and some data, so it significantly lowers the cost compared to doing a traditional bench experiment. You could try writing your own DNA alignment tool! (Maybe use this algorithm? Needleman‚ÄìWunsch algorithm - Wikipedia) You could try many other things, but I do think writing a DNA alignment tool is a good start."
1036,"I don‚Äôt talk about personal politics on public forums; instead, I will stick to facts as much as possible. In short, everything below I believe to be true, but not everything I believe is true is written below. (-:It‚Äôs far too early to know for sure exactly what the impact will be. As of this writing (mid-Nov 2016) we don‚Äôt even know who is going to be in key policy positions. Then, we don‚Äôt know how the Senate and House will react to their policy views. We don‚Äôt know how much party-line‚Äîcrossing there will be; likely very little for the most part, but that is harder to predict if a policy is clearly prejudicial or damaging to the economy at large.Now, in terms of impact, there are personal impacts and job impacts.In terms of job impacts, it seems highly unlikely that anyone who is well-educated will do poorly in the short term. The US has tremendous economic opportunities for people who are skilled in high-value fields. Those companies are not going to fill their jobs out of nowhere. If the government starts to put in place policies that make it difficult to hire talented employees, companies will take those positions to where the employees are ‚Äî abroad ‚Äî creating exactly the opposite situation of what Trump promised when he ran. Of course, politics rarely follows along strictly rational lines of calculation, but ultimately it‚Äôs therefore important to separate bluster for the press versus what actually happens quietly in the background.Keep in mind, also, that if the job market does change by the time you graduate, unless the Revolution comes, you‚Äôre hardly the one who will be impacted. Anyone who is willing to pick up sticks, move half-way around the world, deal with differences in language and food and climate and a dozen other things, is likely going to have a place somewhere in the world. Getting a quality education can only help that.In terms of personal impacts, it might depend quite a bit on what you look like ‚Äî in some locations. However, the vast majority especially of US research universities are not located in the places that are also appear to be the most prejudiced. Indeed, this election further widened the gap between urban and rural areas, and urban areas resoundingly voted for a more global perspective. A student at Brown doesn‚Äôt live in the USA as much as they live in Providence, a vibrant, multi-cultural town with numerous nationalities and races represented broadly. Inasmuch as you think the vote for Trump says anything, only about five states gave Clinton a higher percentage of vote (and not by much) than Rhode Island. So to someone who lived here, on a day-to-day basis, there would hardly be any perceptible difference in treatment. If anything, at this moment many people are especially sensitive and careful about how they treat others.It is also easy to forget how much progress has been made in the US. People reading about the election from a distance, getting news dominated by Trump, might be surprised to hear that in this election season, the US has voted in [list courtesy Brighten Godfrey]:Stephanie Murphy (FL) ‚Äî first Vietnamese-American woman elected to CongressCatherine Cortez Masto (NM) ‚Äî first Latina elected to U.S. SenatePramila Jayapal (WA) ‚Äî first person of South Asian descent elected to House of RepresentativesKamala Harris (CA) ‚Äî first person of South Asian descent elected to U.S. SenateIlhan Omar (MN) ‚Äî first Somali-American legislator (she was elected to the state house of representatives)Kate Brown (OR) ‚Äî first openly LGBTQ governorTammy Duckworth (IL) ‚Äî first female senator that has seen combat, and second Asian-American female senatorSamuel Park (GA) ‚Äî first openly gay man in the Georgia legislatureand so on. I bet those stories were not covered in the international press. Note that Ilhan Omar is openly Muslim, and even wears a hijab. There are many Muslim countries where she could not even stand for election.Finally, just remember that eight years ago the USA voted in its first black president. Things go in cycles. History is long, and bears reading.Personally, I‚Äôm pretty confident I could mail out my resume to a bunch of different countries and get pretty positive responses. (When something happens in the US, I get notification from foreign friends of job postings at their university‚Ä¶.) Let‚Äôs just say I haven‚Äôt dusted off my vita at all. In time, I think most things heal themselves. In the meanwhile, I‚Äôm committed to doing what I can to improve the education of students and state of knowledge‚Äîthe very same things I was committed to the day before the election."

Ask Auto drivers:-Try this if you got no other option.I have been in the same situation and i found the a decent hotel with the help of an auto driver. My Gf is mexican, who looks almost Indian so there wasn‚Äôt a problem until they noticed her passport, which also looked Indian(navy blue cover). Unfortunately we were not allowed to stay due to different nationalities(I am Indian), which is still not clear to me why ? but the point is these auto drivers know the city better than anyone else. If you are willing to pay them a their little commission (I paid Rs100 more) which is usually paid by ugly hotels. they will show you the plethora of decent choices. Rest is up to you.Edit:Please do not forget to carry your valid ID proof.If you still can‚Äôt figure out just message me or comment. I‚Äôll be more than happy to help you to search a decent place. Hope you enjoy and have a memorable fun"

1039,"There are two definitions of ‚Äúevolution‚Äù that we need to distinguish here, plus subsidiary concepts that are intimately related.One is ‚Äúbiological evolution‚Äù: that heritable traits exist in biological organisms, and that the distribution of these traits changes over generational time.This is an observed fact.Further to that, over considerable time (think of geological time scales), the changes that accrue can be considerable; the fossil record attests to this fact, as well as numerous other lines of independent evidence.Two is ‚Äúmechanisms of biological evolution‚Äù: for instance, evolution by natural selection, genetics, proteomics, etc., which are all aspects of the ‚Äútheory of evolution‚Äù.This is a framework of well-tested (implied: well-supported) hypotheses that explain observations relating to the first definition.The latter, together, and because they are well supported by evidence, is the theory of evolution. It is a model that explains what we objectively observe and predicts things we are yet to observe ‚Äî in character and quality, if not always in precise detail.Because we don‚Äôt know everything perfectly ‚Äî that is, because the theory of evolution is a model ‚Äî its collection of hypotheses is always under varying degrees of refinement, though the core concepts are very well understood and very well fixed; it‚Äôs mainly at the edges of our knowledge that things may need to be refined. We cannot preclude that some new discovery will not shake the boat, but we can put reasonably long odds on such a an event.We can certainly rule out the rantings and ravings of professional young earth creationists: they are poison to science, to grounded religious faith, and to society, and I won‚Äôt entertain them further than necessary in this answer.Evolution the observed fact has been proven precisely because it has been objectively observed, and anyone with a wish to do so may take the definition of evolution-the-fact (not some distorted version that shifts the goalposts in some unscrupulous way ‚Äî poison to the mind) and see that heritable changes occur and propagate on observable time scales. As with many things in science, you have to look closely and carefully ‚Äî and clearly ‚Äî which is why science is not always easy.Evolution-the-theory is ‚Äúproven‚Äù in the sense that it has advanced through collective effort on the part of both impartial and hostile critics and accumulated evidence in support and survived tests that should have falsified it. Its core ideas are sound (based on the observed fact), and when wrong ideas about it have been proposed, they have, over time (and through the effort of rigorous investigation) been rejected (or more likely refined). Through the same effort it will continue to be refined."
1040,"Personal Favourite‚Ä¶‚Ä¶. & No.1 ‚ÄòThe' Half Girlfriend (2017)‚ÄúMuch more than a Headache ; Little less than a Suicide‚ÄùSummary:- Half Girlfriend is very cleverly marketed as a story of Madhav, a Hindi speaking Bihari who falls in love with Riya, an elite Delhi girl at the prestigious St. Stephen‚Äôs College. It deceives you into believing that the story would revolve around the travails of a person who cannot speak English. However, it is a story about being horny for someone way above your league and then giving it the name of true love.The leading pair makes it to the esteemed college through the sports quota.The two bond over basketball and soon enough, the Bihari suggests games involving her basket and his balls. Riya, who isn't up for such shenanigans, forces on him an arrangement of half-girlfriendship, which is understood to be a relation more than friendship but excludes the physical-whisical. The Bihari male hormones soon get the better of Madhav, who professes his love with a: ‚ÄúDeti hai toh de, warna kat le.‚Äù Riya chooses the latter and kattofies, telling Madhav to never contact her again. Months pass before the Bihari boy can gather the courage to speak with her again, and when he does, Riya hands him her shaadi ka cardcomplete with chocolates and stuff.With Riya married off to a hotel-mogul in London, Madhav realizes that there isn't much to look forward to in Delhi. He therefore decides to go back to his village Dumraon to help his mother in running her rural school. But before he leaves, he sits for placements and makes the panel realize that the interviewers themselves are facing a mid-life crisis,then Madhav leaves for Bihar because it makes a good scene for a Bollywood movie- idealistic and shit.Mr. Jha, as we will now call him, starts helping his mother at her school, where they need funds to build toilets.As the government officials are unable to help in any way, the next obvious step is to get the founder of Microsoft to build our toilets.As luck would have it, Bill Gates decides to visit Bihar with his team from the Gates Foundation.Jha-Man soon enrolls himself for some English classes at Patna, the city where he also runs into Riya. ZOMG, how did this happen again! Totally did not see it coming!.Riya is now a divorcee and is working with Nestle. Madhav, with renewed hope of love, now helps her with setting up her little apartment, and in return, our lady helps him with his speech for Gates.Very close to the day of the big speech, Madhav takes Riya home to his mother, who gives our pretty lady the stares. The newly-in-love do some jumma chumma de de on the terrace.Immediately after the grand event, Riya memsa'ab goes missing. When Jha sa'ab goes around looking for his lady love, he receives a letter from Riya in which she tells him about her terminal lung cancer and how she has decided to go underground and die alone because she doesn't want him to take care of her in her last days.Jha-Boy looks for Riya-Babe all over but didn't get her.Through a journal which Madhav got from Riya's landlord from apartment where she resided, Madhav learns about the domestic violence his lady had to go through in her marriage, about how she was sexually abused as a child and about how Madhav‚Äôs mother had told her to stay away from him because of which she had to make up the cancer story and leave Mr. Jha to his own misery.(Wow, so much plot twist. *yawn*).Dr. Logic(Jha) remembers that Riya always spoke about wanting to be a singer at a bar in New York and therefore, she must be in New York. (Here, we accord him the title of Sherlock.) Mr. Holmes requests a few of his friends at the Gates Foundation to get him a three month internship in Manhattan. They oblige and Sherlock travels to the Big Apple in search of cray-cray. On his last night in America, he finds out where the crazy woman could be singing,runs like a hippy to reach he..."
