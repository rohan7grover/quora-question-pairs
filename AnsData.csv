what is the story of kohinoor kohinoor diamond	what would happen if the indian government stole the kohinoor kohinoor diamond back	0	History of Kohinoor DiamondThe Kohinoor is one of the oldest and most famous diamonds in the world. The history of the Kohinoor goes back in history to more than 5000 years ago. The current name of the diamond, Koh-i-noor is in Persian and means “Mountain of Light”. Below you will find a timeline of this priceless diamond.Up to 1500It is believed that the diamond was first mentioned more than 5000 years ago in a Sanskrit script, where it was called the Syamantaka.SyamantakaIt is worth mentioning that there is only speculation that the Syamantaka and the Kohinoor are the same diamond. After this first written mention, for over 4,000 years the diamond is not mentioned.Maharajah Ranjit SinghUp until 1304 the diamond was in the possession of the Rajas of Malwa, but back then, the diamond was still not named Kohinoor. In 1304, it belonged to the Emperor of Delhi, Allaudin Khilji.In 1339, the diamond was taken back to the city of Samarkand, where it stayed for almost 300 years. In 1306 in a Hindi writing, a curse is placed on the men who will wear the diamond: “He who owns this diamond will own the world, but will also know all its misfortunes. Only God, or a woman, can wear it with impunity.”BaburBaburIn 1526 the Mogul ruler Babur mentions the diamond in his writings, Baburmama.The diamond was gifted to him by the Sultan Ibrahim Lodi.He was the one who described the diamond’s value equal to half-day production costs of the world.One of the descendants of Babur, Aurangzeb , protected the diamond diligently and passed it on to his heirs.Mahamad, the grandson of Aurangzeb, however, was not a fear-inspiring and great ruler like his grandfather.Nadir and MahamadNadir ShahThe Persian general Nadir Shah went to India in 1739. He wanted to conquer the throne, which had been weakened during the reign of Sultan Mahamad. The Sultan lost the decisive battle and had to surrender to Nadir.It was him the one that gave the diamond its current name, Koh-i-noor meaning “Mountain of light”.But Nadir Shah did not live for long, because in 1747 he was assassinated and the diamond got to one of his generals, Ahmad Shah Durrani.A descendant of Ahmad Shah, Shah Shuja Durrani brought the Koh-i-noor back to India in 1813 and gave it to Ranjit Singh (the founder of the Sikh Empire). In exchange Ranjit Singh helped Shah Shuja get back the throne of Afghanistan.British East India CompanyIn 1849, after the conquest of the Punjab by the British forces, the properties of the Sikh Empire were confiscated.The Koh-i-noor was transferred to the treasury of the British East India Company in Lahore.The properties of the Sikh Empire were taken as war compensations. Even one line of the Treaty of Lahore was dedicated to the fate of the Koh-i-Noor.The diamond was shipped to Britain on a ship where cholera broke out and supposedly the keeper of the diamond lost it for some days and it was returned to him by his servant.The diamond was handed to Queen Victoria in July 1850.Queen VictoriaKohinoor diamond in Queen-s Victoria broochWhen Nadir Shah heard of the diamond, he decided he wants it in his possession.After the diamond was handed to Queen Victoria, it was exhibited at the Crystal Palace a year later. But the “Mountain of Light” was not shiny as the other cut gemstones of that era and there was a general disappointment regarding it.In 1852 the Queen decided to reshape the diamond and it was taken to a Dutch jeweler, Mr Cantor who cut it to 108.93 carats.Queen Victoria wore the diamond occasionally afterwards. She left in her will that the Koh-i-noor should only be worn by a female queen.If the head of state was a man, his wife would have to carry the diamond. After Queen Victoria’s death, the Kohinoor became part of the Crown Jewels.	Forget about attacking, No one on earth can attack UK. Instead if any country attacks the UK we as being part of Commonwealth will move heaven and earth to defend the UK. We are a major ally of the UK ever since WWI.Stealing? Seriously!!, you think anyone can steal the Crown Jewel of the UK. Even a man sitting in Buckingham Palace cannot do it. Let a lone a foreigner.You are trying to emulate views of people about what would happen if UK and India is in a Stand Off. But your premise is too childish.The United Kingdom's external debt is 406% of their GDP. The Republic of India's external debt is just 22.8% of our GDP.We are way ahead of the kingdom and much less in debt of anybody. Simply, we don't need a Diamond to put up somewhere.
how can i increase the speed of my internet connection while using a vpn	how can internet speed be increased by hacking through dns	0	Hey! There are few options to increase the speed of VPN connection.LocationWhat are really matter for VPN Connection - Server Location (country and distance of VPN server from you its most important). So, for first find the optimal location of server. For example my VPN Shield provider give me choice of 11 countries. I prefer to connect to UK, because the speed is much better then in US. See the speedtest results:UK connected (L2TP)US connected (L2TP):ProtocolUse the protocol which is best for you.For example, if I change the protocol to PPTP from L2TP, the speed results goes some lower:UK connected (PPTP)WiFi/Router model and firmwareSome routers could limit the maximum speed of the connection depend on protocol you use. I recommend to check the reviews and find the latest firmware upgrade.	"Using DNS functionality, you can use your computer's ""hosts"" file to redirect slow and/or unnecessary servers to localhost (your own computer).  For example, if there's a website you go to with  large ads or a slow metrics server, you can create entries for the server names in your hosts file so your PC won't be able to send or receive data from them.  (For example, Spybot S&D does this to block known malware and tracking servers, which will speed up browsing by reducing traffic to and from your computer and those specific servers.)You can also cache DNS lookups locally, however many browsers already do this.  If yours doesn't, or you want to use this speedup across all the computers on your network, try using your router's built-in DNS if it has one. Some, for example those running DD-WRT firmware, can be made to cache DNS lookups improving speed.  (Your PCs use your router for DNS, the router uses your ISP for DNS.)"
why am i mentally very lonely how can i solve it	find the remainder when math2324math is divided by 2423	0	While reading your question I pictured myself at your age. Psychologically, it’s soothing when you find another person with similar experience and generally ( 90% cases ) this makes you feel an invisible connection with that person.First of all ,I don’t want to take this line - “none of my friends is on my level of intelligence” as a fact, because Intelligence is something very complicated to describe. The human brain is as complex as the universe. And, you can’t just measure the intelligence of a person with some special ability he possesses while others don’t. In this regard, you can read Dylan James's answer to What are the most annoying types of questions on Quora?Now, for the sake of argument, let's say, you have a very high IQ score, which is the evidence of your high intelligence. Now, why are you bothered with the part “you are better in intelligence than anyone or you are lower than anyone or you are unique and different from others”? You should just focus on your action. Try to use your intelligence in your thoughts and actions. Otherwise, what is the value of your Intelligence? If you’re in different level to communicate with mass people and don’t even feel the necessity to join their daily chit-chat; don’t regret it. It’s quite alright! But, if you desperately want to connect to people with different interests, then try to act in a wise way so that they can easily interact with your [1] .Secondly , at your age I would like to formulate on Tesseracts geometry , closed universe model equations , String Theory , Parallel Universes , Inflationary Cosmology , Quantum Mechanics , Metaphysics and the unsolved problems of Number Theory . My world was just with the physics books which were lent from libraries , loads of mathematical Olympiad books , chess board , Sudoku , Rubik's Cube , pencils ,fresh and torn paper ( In those days ( 2005–2008) internet was out of my reach or I didn’t have the luxury to use it ) . In general ( 90% cases ) I found people of my age were somehow so average that they always tried/did those things which were instructed by the society/tradition/religion/friend-circle/family …. . I tried to analyse why they do what they do ? Why I do What I do ? Why is the differences ? How the difference have been created ? Is it evolutionary ? I did the analysis of almost everything in my head . That made me a secluded person . Its evolutionary that average people are afraid of unknown which ultimately brings fear to connect with different vibes . I found people around me performed their sacred duties to do what they were told to do or they were supposed to do or they had to align with the mass-people's vibe. It was their definition of life to live and that doesn’t prove they aren’t intelligent enough to resonate with me :)The most ridiculous thing once I discussed (foolishly/accidentally/daringly) with our physics professor (in private environment) that I had found some flaws in the special theory of relativity and I had a way to show it. Then somehow the news had spread in my college and I found a number of people with similar tastes, interests and thought process. They would like to accept my challenges. They offered me to have a debate with them on a reasonable ground. After that incident, we were found discussing , arguing about the topics in anywhere , anytime with anyone ( we got some active audiences too ) … That was the first time, I felt that I’m alive. I discovered myself as an analytical person and the only thing I love is the reason , argument and discussions.I even carried out my secret model theory of the infinite universe in a piece of torn paper to show it to whoever feels interested in my vibe. The end part was I found no one for the next three years and when I found at least someone to show my thoughts, I was no more interested in those childish theory/act of my earlier life. By that time, I was completely a different person outside trying to adapt another spectrum of people and environment to keep me alive other than being mentally dead or secluded.Well, in college, I had a narrow circle. But, when I went to university, I found a wide band of people with different spectrum and so called top most intelligent and meritorious people of our country.A large number of them was intelligent but not cognitive or intellectual in thought or taste according to my primary test . Well, intelligent people are sometimes intellectual ( when a computer scientist has made an A.I with considering the facts other than just a narrow view of people / world ) but , sometimes intelligent people are not intelligent enough to be analytic/ cognitive to the broader aspect of society or people ( For example , When , an engineer deliberately helps a terrorist to build bomb because his only passion or love is to create bomb but which purpose it has been used doesn’t matter until it interferes with his narrow circle of life ) .Thirdly , I have seen people in my life who are too much practical , less analytical outside the topics of their focus and always busy in building some particular thing . They are actually engineers who finally happened to be realist and less theoretical . Some are too much social and activists . I found one friend among them . I can’t get himself in philosophical or metaphysical discussion in deep level to understand or to resonate . I can’t dance with his vibe and he can’t dance with mine. His talk was deep with others only when he was on his project discussions or his field research . I found the problem of seclusion involves being not practical / more philosophical less practical / 100% philosophical or metaphysical in general ( most cases ) .Fourthly, you want to share with someone physically . Does that mean you try to emphasis more on emotional or hormonal significance of sharing than the fact you ‘re just interacting with someone who understands and care to understand you ? Well , maybe the people around you or the environment doesn’t suit you . So, you physically can’t get someone near you . I think travelling can help you to solve about physical part of the problem .Join Book clubs . Take part in discussions . Listen , what others have to say . Question them , question your views . Express your views … Well, that’s a start :)I assure you , in this way you may found a lot more intelligent people for communication , who happen to be on different level of intelligence to connect with you ( according to your view/ survey / estimation) .[1] Actually , its the era of internet . So , you don’t want to bother about the fact being mentally lonely . Do you?You will found a lots of amazing people in Quora ( yes, specially in Quora ) , Reddit (product) , Disqus with similar interest to talk or discuss . If you are even shy to do that then try to practice writing your idea or thoughts in comment sections . You can try it in Facebook (product) also .Start your own website or blog . Try to open your view in anything you are interested . Maybe , some people of different interest found your thought/ writing interesting enough to study the topics to just talk with you ; to make reason or argue with you . That may be interesting to you . Isn’t it? You may even found some people with similar tastes to interact .If writing on internet blog is too much hard for you then start keeping personal diary or notes . Once you start to write , you will find words to express everything inside and outside around you .You can work on your own project and write journal by using internet only . Attend open lectures , seminars of professors , question them . Get help from teachers.Read blogs of people that interests you . Take active participation in comment sectionRead a lot . Use Goodreads to write reviews . Take part in book discussions. Read books of all kinds ( not only which interests you most) . Listen to other peoples thoughts . Make analysis and publish them .Download published journal papers on your interested topics. Read the prior work , current work on that topics. Make questions and mail the author about your questions and ideas about his work . Find out experts people/ professors on your interested field in the internet . Then try to make a conversation with them about the work.Another , smart way to be social and to bring friends in your metaphysical world can be done by working with tactics. At first , try to listen people around you . Categorizes themselves on a scale of similarity 0 to 10 . Take the top most people on your little experiment . Socialize with them in a common way , try to understand and analyze them . Then , slowly use your amazing philosophical conversation to dance with them . Be adaptive a little and compromise with them for greater benefit of your own . In this way you are opening the gate between your world and their world . As you are the maker of the whole idea so the key point of winning to bring themselves in your world through the gate is in your hand . After that , decorate your world to amaze them . Because , when you have friend who care to listen what you say then you can open up to them . This may liquefy your loneliness :)If you are a logical person you may know that someone with similar interests will not always miraculously ( incident with comparatively low probability is the scientific term for miracle/ luck/ bad luck ) come to talk with you .You have to express yourself about what you do or want to do ,not to impress someone ;but to define who you really are !Isn’t it ? :)	Using the J programming language:a#~ *./23 35=24 36|/a=.10+i.50071 143 215 287 359 431 503So all seven of these integers meet the criteria. The list can continue indefinitely, by adding 72 to the last number in the list.
which one dissolve in water quikly sugar salt methane and carbon di oxide	which fish would survive in salt water	0	Not enough data to answer, you need to add the particle size of the sugar or salt, and say if the mixture is stirred or not. Generally speaking higher temperature, faster stirring and smaller particle size make things dissolve quicker.	Ah, the old “drown ’em or desiccate ‘em” question. This turns out to be a real thinker. Let’s begin, shall we..The basics: There are 1.386 billion cubic kilometers of water on Planet Earth. Eliminating all of it would surely kill us (since we’re made largely of water), but we’d probably die before then due to atmospheric disturbances. See, the oceans provide much of our oxygen and house huge stores of carbon dioxide. By eliminating the water, carbon dioxide would flood into the air and poison us.However, we could survive this. We could remain in buildings that had the ability to filter out carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. Most humans would die, but a few would survive.Once all the water was gone, though, we’d have to manufacture our own…but it would just disappear every second. So, I’m going to say that 1.386 billion seconds after water starts disappearing, we all die. That’s around 44 years.Quick.Now, what about the flood? Can it kill us before then?This one requires a bit more math, and some interesting mental discussions. For example, could a suitably large breeding population of people live at the bottom of the ocean indefinitely? I think the answer to that question is “yes”, though doing so would involve a massive undertaking of nuclear / geothermal power research as well as improvements to the technology of food production under those rather harsh environments. But do we have the time to do that research and prepare the habitats before the world is inundated?For this, we’ll need a spherical shell of water high enough to cover Mt. Everest. The volume of that shell is given by𝑉=43𝜋(𝑅3−𝑟3)V=43π(R3−r3)V = \frac{4}{3}\pi(R^3 - r^3)Now, this isn’t exactly a spherical shell (the Earth is oblate) and there’s all that land in the way.How much land?Well, thanks to Quora, this great website where one can find answers of this kind, I read this:John Flavin's answer to What is the volume of Earth's above-sea-level landmass, and would all this land fit inside the planet's oceans?Which says that there are 125 million cubic kilometers of land above sea level. So whatever volume we get from the spherical shell, we’ll subtract the 1.25E8.So, the radius of the Earth, at sea level, is 6,371 km. Mt. Everest is just 8.848 km tall, so our outer radius is 6379.8 km.Plugging all of that in gives us 4.495 billion cubic kilometers. Subtracting away the land volume above sea level reduces this to about 4.37 billion cubic kilometers of water.At 1 sec per cubic kilometer, we have 138.47 years before there is no dry land (side note: Noah’s flood seems even more ridiculous, in light of the fact that it would take 138.47 years to cover all of the land at the astonishing rate of a cubic kilometer of water created per second).You might think “Aha! Desiccation for the win!”But allow me to point out that it’s 138.47 years for Mt. Everest to be covered. We’d have a lot less time before ordinary “land” would be covered. In fact, if we just stop at land that is less than just 3 km high (which is pretty high - above that altitude, there are no trees and the soil is practically non-existent) we have only 1.5 billion seconds, or 47.5 years.Long before then, 99.9% of the people on the planet are displaced from their homes by salt water. Water that is going to make farming impossible and quickly starve us.But would we all die? No. I can envision a few people clinging to existence, eating only fish and slowly climbing mountainsides to avoid the rising seas.So I’m giving this one to desiccation, but only barely. We definitely would struggle to maintain our existence on a flooded world with barely a decade before complete disruption of 99% of the population of our planet. But could we hang on for 44 years? Yes, I think we could.One last thought: There is an enormous amount of water in the crust and mantle. If we consider that, too, then perhaps humans don’t immediately turn to dry powder 44 years out. In that case, we might just survive longer with the drying than with the flood, though the removal of water from the crust and mantle would result in massive geological instabilities, volcanic eruptions, earthquakes, and an actual collapse of our planet’s crust. So yeah, probably not.Either way, Everyone Dies™
astrology i am a capricorn sun cap moon and cap risingwhat does that say about me	i am a triple capricorn sun moon and ascendant in capricorn what does this say about me	1	You are a monster of ambition, even if you do not show it outwardly. Your desire to better yourself and achieve something tangible, lasting in life is almost certainly very strong indeed. You definitely “play the long game”, taking one step at a time, until your goals are reached; you don’t mind if it doesn’t happen overnight… it will take decades, and you are cool with that. The goals you have are slow, but steady; you are more the tortoise than the hare. You almost surely agree with the statement: “I’m a firm believer in luck; and the harder I work, the more luck I find that I have.” You have a realistic idea of how the world works, and you will trust what people DO long before you will trust what people SAY. You probably are sparing with words, but long on action. You probably are quite modest and seemingly unassuming… even when you are a success, you do not over-aggrandize yourself. You probably have a superb, dry sense of humor. You like art, music and architecture which has withstood the passage of time, taking a dim view of new fads which are merely “flashes in the pan”. You love what lasts, what endures. You probably dress conservatively, and often do not need to be the center of attention; you know that visibility— and sterling reputation— can be two very different things. You probably love the outdoors, and may be a superb fisherman, camper, explorer, naturalist, gardener, landscaper or carpenter, and your home is almost surely filled with interesting things you’ve made by hand, and souvenirs of fascinating places you’ve visited. You love animals very much and almost certainly own a dog. You do not mind rolling your sleeves up, perspiring and getting dirty. You are a great “McGyver”, and know how to improvise and make do with limited resources. You love to help people when they need it the most. You may have a taste for some choice, expensive things— such as car or clothing or jewelry—- yet for the most part you are not especially consumed with a need for flashy luxury. You may have a traditional religion, because you like things that have very old reputations and philosophies. When you visit a new city, it will be the very old, historical sites that attract you the most.Basically, in this life, your soul had the purpose of richly living in the real, concrete world and respecting things that are sturdy, reliable and natural.

The car is styled very sharply and the three-dimensional Tata Motors marquee is hosted in a very classy manner. The car gets great aerodynamics, sharp lines and smooth curves, which gives it a confident and powerful stance.InteriorTata Tiago interiors feature dual tone interior scheme, full fabric upholstery, premium finish and plastics around the cabin. The chrome finishes on the air vents further accentuate the looks inside. The seats are very well cushioned. And like all other Tata cars, Tiago has an ample of Space inside !PerformanceTata Tiago Petrol XZ specifications include a 1.05-litre engine with a 5-speed manual transmission. The engine offers a power output of 69 bhp at 400 rpm. The maximum torque produced by the Tiago is 140 Nm, which is delivered between 1800 – 3000rpm.The major setback for the car is the fact that both Maruti Celerio and Hyundai i10 are offered with an automatic transmission :(And for the customers asking the questions“ kitna deti he ? “The company has given assurance of 23kmpl. Which is pretty decent to compete with others in the segment.This variant of Tiago is offered with ABS and EBD, driver and passenger airbags, and a vehicle stability control system.The Follow-Me Home headlamps and Anti-theft device further add to the safety features of the car.With the tilt adjustable power steering, the handling of the car is quite decent	First of All, ask yourself this Question “Do you really want to keep away your children far from the Mobile and TV?”.If Yes, then it will take A lot of Your Time and Availability for your Children and you will have to replace your TV and Mobile with yourself.Now, let’s find out why did our children are showing more interest towards the Mobile Phone and TV?Because, we do not have time these days and busy doing other things (i.e. busy with our career and balancing social life etc). Everyday (except weekends) starts with a full throttle run and ends thinking about the next day.Childrens/Kids do not understand this race and they have their own needs. At first, we try our level best to fulfill those needs because that is not negotiable and as soon as the time flies, we try to negotiate their needs with what we have.Nowadays, Mobile Phone are the fourth necessity of the human life after Bread, Cloths and Shelter (Roti, Kapda & Makan) and almost everybody have a mobile phone, so at first we try to negotiate with the Mobile phone.Kids are Curious to learn and they are also very much adoptable. They learn things very fast and as soon as you handover a mobile phone to a kid they start exploring it (just after they come out of their fear). They find it quite useful because they can do whatever they want to.The same goes with the TV.Now, if you can take yourself back around 10–15 years, you will realize our parents have a lot of time for us. As our family used to be a Joint and Giant one, we used to get the same participation from our Uncles, Aunts and other relative. We used to have very few toys but that were somehow manageable with all the cousins and friends.Back then, the life was not so rushing and our parents had time for us. That’s why we did not have any interest towards these things.So, if you want to keep your children away from TV and Mobile, then do not negotiate with your role as a parent with a mobile and TV.“When they need you, make yourself available. Do not walk away making any negotiation.”Peace :)
how can i be a good geologist	what should i do to be a great geologist	1	This is one of the nicest questions I’ve seen!Well, here’s some pointers to what makes a difference in what is one of the most extraordinary and fundamental professions…..Humility. The Earth is greater than all of us. Up until now it has provided the basis of our everything. And equally it can take it all away in a flash.The ability to imagine. What you see now in our world is not necessarily what has come before and the Earth System has a track record that goes back 4.6 billion years…..but has only preserved a portion of its tale. The rest we have to infer.Ability to handle uncertainty. Unless you can pick up something in your hand and sample it, then you’ll always be relying on stand-off (second-hand) analysis of what it is. Often, you will be sampling no more than a trillionth of the bigger picture.Synthesis. You will pull from a myriad of sources of information from the nanometric to the galactic. And you may voyage through this universe in a single day.Grace. You will tap into all the other grand sciences which peer down at you, but you will have a wry smile to yourself that without you no-one would understand Home.Passion. How can you not be excited by the Earth? This is a subject you never need to switch off from and keeps giving for as long as you ask questions.A Story-Teller. You are suspicious of dogma for you know that too much is unknown, but there is still much meaning to be gleaned from careful and fair observation.Patience. You will never likely have all the facts. But you are adding to a Great Story.A capacity to never stop learning. Your “office” will be the grandest thing you’re ever likely to encounter and you will only ever discover a proportion of what there is to know about it.I therefore tend to believe that a Good Geologist has many of the qualities of a Good Human Being.

motorola company can i hack my charter motorolla dcx3400	how do i hack motorola dcx3400 for free internet	0	I have never heard of anyone cracking the encryption to steal services.  It is definitely possible to do some hacking on the box but not really for much in the way of being a set top box.  There is also variation between phase 1, phase 2 and phase 3 boxes both in hardware and software.  Also different ISP's run different boot loaders and operating software.   Some of the ports are not enabled and don't have drivers installed.   That being said, I have seen these boxes hacked into 8 bit game emulators, and run custom spins of Linux and used as low end desk tops.  I have also heard that some of the older phase 1 boxes in Europe were hit with Malware and pulled into a bot net for Ddos attacks.  Warning:  Hacking it will likely get you a bill for the cost of the unit from Charter.

method to find separation of slits using fresnel biprism	what are some of the things technicians can tell about the durability and reliability of laptops and its components	0	The Fresnel's Biprism Experiment setup illustrates the phenomenon of interference of light.In this experiment, we are much interested in calculating the wavelength of given monochromatic light.White light is a combination of lights of different wavelength in electromagnetic spectrum. Electromagnetic radiation with a wavelength between 380nm and 760nm. This is the case with white light.While, the Sodium light that we use has only two wavelength 589.0nm and 589.6nm.This is the case with sodium light.Therefore we use sodium light so that we can get fine line of different wavelength(2 lines for sodium light) while white light contains a range of wavelengths so fine lines are not possible.Note : image used are for illustration purpose only. Images are taken from google images.	I hate to be ‘that guy’ but Apple are off the hook when it comes to build quality for consumer/business laptops. Lenovo aren’t too bad, but they can be problematic depending on the specific model.Dell do a good job for business, but the consumer laptops are piles of dogshit.HP, much like Dell, have some great business laptops, but their consumer gear can be pretty bad.Gateway? Are they still around? I used to work for them and wouldn’t bother.ASUS make some awesome laptops, but they also make some terrible laptops. Their main problem is support.Brands to avoid at all costs: Acer, Toshiba, Fujitsu, and Sony. All for different reasons (build quality, support, and usability).
what can make physics easy to learn	how can you make physics easy to learn	1	You need to see the application of physics around yourself to create interest in physics.Eg) Say you are driving and there is a sharp corner where negotiating speed limit is stated. Your study of physics will help you understand how this speed limit is arrived at. You see a bridge with a maximum weight limit stated.Physics will help you to understand how this maximum number was arrived at. So to develop interest, try to find how things happening in your surrounding are related to physics principles. Physics is not a hard subject to master or understand. It mostly involves application of rules, such as Ohm’s law for electricity for electrical circuits or to measure current when you know component resistance and voltage applied, or newtons laws for motions to find distance traveled or speed after certain time, etc. One way you can improve your knowledge and interest is to read Physics books written by different authors. This will make it easier to understand the concepts. I used to be in your situation and improved when I did what I have stated herein.Hope I helped :)	You need to see the application of physics around yourself to create interest in physics.Eg) Say you are driving and there is a sharp corner where negotiating speed limit is stated.

what was your first sexual experience like	what was your first sexual experience	1	Definitely a memorable experience :-) I had to take permission of the guy before writing this, and he told me that I can only write it when we both are together. So here is how it went-He was my first boyfriend, a guy from school who managed to woo me during Junior College (Class 11th). We were teenagers when we started dating, and it was quite normal to be curious. So our late night phone conversations tended to get quite naughty. But we had to wait until after Junior College for it to happen for the first time.His parents had gone away for a week, and so we had finally made our plans. He somehow got the condoms procured. I had a good session at the beauty parlour the day before.I arrived at his place in the afternoon, wearing a spaghetti purple crop top, denim jeans and jacket and he was kind of already excited when I rang his doorbell (Could make out from what I saw in his shorts).We went to his bedroom making sure we had locked both, the main door and his bedroom door. He made me sit beside him on the bed and locked his lips onto mine. After a good, long, passionate kiss, he took my jacket off and began kissing and licking my sensitive neck and ears from behind. That was the point where I knew I wasn't going to be able to resist that day.He then helped me out of my jacket and after making me lie down, began to kiss my hands and teased the bare skin of my belly with a finger for sometime before getting me out of my spaghetti top. I remembered the look on his face when he first saw my breasts- like the way a kid looks on for a candy. After some passionate lovemaking to my breasts, he slid my jeans and panties down and proceeded to tease my clit with his tongue, making sure I had a couple of orgasms already before he decided to penetrate me. When he first went in, I felt a sharp stab of pain, which slowly subsided even as he could no longer resist thrusting hard till he finally collapsed.After laying beside each other for sometime, he carried me in his arms to the shower and helped me wash. And we had some light dinner, and then cuddled into each other in bed as we went into a dreamy sleep.So yeah, quite a good first sex experience. We dated for a couple of years after that, but had to split, though we still remain good friends. He's with me right now, as he helped me write this answer and we're alone. Good night readers. :D	Definitely a memorable experience :-) I had to take permission of the guy before writing this, and he told me that I can only write it when we both are together.

what are the laws to change your status from a student visa to a green card in america how do they compare to the immigration laws in canada	what are the laws to change your status from a student visa to a green card in america how do they compare to the immigration laws in japan	0	Simply, you can’t.There is no direct route from student to green card - your student visa entitles you to study in the USA, then after you must return to your home country.To transition (eventually) to a green card, you first have to find a employer who will sponsor you for an employment visa (H1B for example), and then you have to be lucky enough to be selected for one (many more people apply than receive).After a few years working in the USA, you may then become eligible to transition to a permanent resident - but again, most employment visas are not “dual intent” - they only allow someone to work in the USA for a number of years, before again, going home. The H1B is one of these.Everything you need to know about US Visas is available on the department of state website - Employment-Based Immigrant Visas	Unfortunately, there is no legal way to change your student visa to a green card in the US. One of the easiest and fastest ways to get a US green card is to marry a US citizen. We put together a short video addressing that.We are not sure how the immigration status can be obtained in Japan.
what would a trump presidency mean for current international master nonascii s students on an f1 visa	how will a trump presidency affect the students presently in us or planning to study in us	1	I don’t talk about personal politics on public forums; instead, I will stick to facts as much as possible. In short, everything below I believe to be true, but not everything I believe is true is written below. (-:It’s far too early to know for sure exactly what the impact will be. As of this writing (mid-Nov 2016) we don’t even know who is going to be in key policy positions. Then, we don’t know how the Senate and House will react to their policy views. We don’t know how much party-line—crossing there will be; likely very little for the most part, but that is harder to predict if a policy is clearly prejudicial or damaging to the economy at large.Now, in terms of impact, there are personal impacts and job impacts.In terms of job impacts, it seems highly unlikely that anyone who is well-educated will do poorly in the short term. The US has tremendous economic opportunities for people who are skilled in high-value fields. Those companies are not going to fill their jobs out of nowhere. If the government starts to put in place policies that make it difficult to hire talented employees, companies will take those positions to where the employees are — abroad — creating exactly the opposite situation of what Trump promised when he ran. Of course, politics rarely follows along strictly rational lines of calculation, but ultimately it’s therefore important to separate bluster for the press versus what actually happens quietly in the background.Keep in mind, also, that if the job market does change by the time you graduate, unless the Revolution comes, you’re hardly the one who will be impacted. Anyone who is willing to pick up sticks, move half-way around the world, deal with differences in language and food and climate and a dozen other things, is likely going to have a place somewhere in the world. Getting a quality education can only help that.In terms of personal impacts, it might depend quite a bit on what you look like — in some locations. However, the vast majority especially of US research universities are not located in the places that are also appear to be the most prejudiced. Indeed, this election further widened the gap between urban and rural areas, and urban areas resoundingly voted for a more global perspective. A student at Brown doesn’t live in the USA as much as they live in Providence, a vibrant, multi-cultural town with numerous nationalities and races represented broadly. Inasmuch as you think the vote for Trump says anything, only about five states gave Clinton a higher percentage of vote (and not by much) than Rhode Island. So to someone who lived here, on a day-to-day basis, there would hardly be any perceptible difference in treatment. If anything, at this moment many people are especially sensitive and careful about how they treat others.It is also easy to forget how much progress has been made in the US. People reading about the election from a distance, getting news dominated by Trump, might be surprised to hear that in this election season, the US has voted in [list courtesy Brighten Godfrey]:Stephanie Murphy (FL) — first Vietnamese-American woman elected to CongressCatherine Cortez Masto (NM) — first Latina elected to U.S. SenatePramila Jayapal (WA) — first person of South Asian descent elected to House of RepresentativesKamala Harris (CA) — first person of South Asian descent elected to U.S. SenateIlhan Omar (MN) — first Somali-American legislator (she was elected to the state house of representatives)Kate Brown (OR) — first openly LGBTQ governorTammy Duckworth (IL) — first female senator that has seen combat, and second Asian-American female senatorSamuel Park (GA) — first openly gay man in the Georgia legislatureand so on. I bet those stories were not covered in the international press. Note that Ilhan Omar is openly Muslim, and even wears a hijab. There are many Muslim countries where she could not even stand for election.Finally, just remember that eight years ago the USA voted in its first black president. Things go in cycles. History is long, and bears reading.Personally, I’m pretty confident I could mail out my resume to a bunch of different countries and get pretty positive responses. (When something happens in the US, I get notification from foreign friends of job postings at their university….) Let’s just say I haven’t dusted off my vita at all.

what does manipulation mean	what does manipulation means	1	Like a lot of English words, it has two levels of meaning: literal and figurative. Its literal, concrete, real-world meaning is moving something with your hand, like manipulating the controls of a game console handset.Its figurative, metaphorical meaning is to control people or events, especially in a secret or underhanded way. Like, the politically unsophisticated think their leader has their best interests at heart; but really, he is manipulating them through their fears.

why do girls want to be friends with the guy they reject	how do guys feel after rejecting a girl	0	Presently I am writing a book and in it I describe why people do what they do. A generic answer is difficult but here it goes. First off I agree with Maya La so I will not repeat. But I will add one5) It is possible they do feel something, but will not admit it or their loyalty/obsession/infatuation with another guy is too strongThere is a point I wish to make. People always believe of themselves to be good, honorable and just. So even when they do something incomprehensible or nigh ugly, they will do their best to satisfy their own conscience. Telling a guy “we can just be friends” falls in this category. From their perspective they did the right thing (if you hurt, too bad!). If you reciprocate the friendship then (always from their perspective) they did the right thing if you do not (always from their perspective) then you a) never wanted to really be their friend or you were not a good friend anyway (so they are right to reject you). As you can see a woman’s conscience seems to be sparkly clean either way.	For his own selfish reasons, he wants to keep you as a friend. What most men don't know is, once you reject (some) women, they want nothing more to do with them. It's very insulting to imply “you're not good enough to be my girlfriend but we can still hang out.” Ummm no. It's not like that. This situation should not be on his terms.Men treat women exactly how they allow him to. And when he gets a new girlfriend, what are you supposed to do? Smile? Cheer for him? Fuck that and fuck him. Twice.I wouldn't be his backup plan or a Robin to his Batman. Move on with your life. Don't communicate with him in any way no matter HOW hard he tries to keep a connection going.You shouldn't have to swallow your hurt while he's happy with your company and you're walking around sad, thinking something is wrong with you when you're perfect just the way you are. There are bigger and better fish in the sea, Doll. Take the hook out of his mouth and throw him back. Chin up and onward. You can do better. Most importantly? You DESERVE better. xo
why are so many quora users posting questions that are readily answered on google	why do people ask quora questions which can be answered easily by google	1	"No. These questions are encouraged as they fit into our mission to share and grow the world's knowledge.Here's some more of our rationale behind this policy. I'll call questions to which the answer can be found easily via a search engine ""easy questions"".When someone has a question, they often don't know whether it's an easy question or not without doing a search. We wouldn't want everyone to have to preemptively search Google before posting a question on Quora.Even if that individual person might have been better off using a search engine for that question than asking on Quora in the short run, their question adds to the collection, and once we get a good answer to it, anyone who has that question in the future will be able to get straight to that. Additionally, the question will be browsable in whatever topics it's added to, it will show up in related questions, and others will be able to reference it from their own answers to different questions.Often the ideal answer we can provide for an easy question is better than what could be quickly found via a search engine. The answer could come from an expert who is well known to be authoritative on the subject, it could explain the reasons why the answer is correct, and it could give a reader more confidence in the answer than a search engine result page.There are a smaller number of easy questions than hard questions, and we should be able to tackle most of them and accumulate a set of great answers to them, so the ongoing burden on the community of answering easy questions should be limited.Easy questions are often the way someone new to Quora will test out the system. Getting a response like ""go Google it"" or getting ignored will turn them away and make Quora less valuable for everyone.The one exception to this is easy questions that are not reusable. We wouldn't want to have every possible sum of three digit numbers like ""what is 432+458"" and ""what is 432+459"" and ""what is 432+460"", etc., in the system. But it would be fine for us to have ""what is the capital of X"" for every country X, since those questions are useful to others."	"Quora might hope that you use Quora for all knowledge searches.I would suggest you use Google when you are seeking information and Quora when you are seeking explanation.Whether it is bad depends on perspective.  Quora wants to own a database with all of the world's knowledge so they can convert that into a boatload of money.  So, of course they welcome people asking those simple questions.  I think it can be bad from the perspective of the users.  It clutters the feed with crap.  I expect my feed to be filled with content that will be interesting to read, not simplistic factoids that can be found anywhere.  Encouraging easy questions on Quora makes Quora a less enjoyable place for me.I don't understand why people do it.  It just doesn't make any kind of sense to me.  Why would someone come to Quora, click on add question, type their question, click through all of the prompts about topics and being sure the question hasn't already been asked and then wait a few hours for the question to make it into the feed of someone willing to answer it, when they could just type the question in their browser search bar and get an immediate answer from Google?There are some questions that Google can handle much better than Quora can.  It can provide a better, more concise, vetted answer and in an instant.  Quora should stick to specializing on what it does better than Google - provide direct contact with people that understand something, so a conversation can happen to bring that understanding to others.A year ago, there was an annoying series of questions each asking for the name of the actor that played a specific character in the 1970s-1980s television sitcom M*A*S*H.  One after another, the questions worked their way through the whole cast.  ""Who played Nurse Houlihan on MASH?"", ""Who played BJ Honeycutt on MASH?"", on through to  ""Who played Hawkeye Pierce on MASH?""Typing that into Google provides:What could a Quora member possibly provide that would improve on that answer?  No amount of expertise or experience will provide a more accurate or precise answer than Alan Alda.  No amount of literary flourish will make that answer more effective.  I used this example on one of the Quora Facebook groups and another member vigorously disagreed.  They said that you never know when one of the Quora members that comes across that simplistic question might actually have something to share, such as they grew up on the same street as Alan Alda and have a story to share.  And that, they said, was the justification to allow such basic questions on Quora.My view is - no.  If people want a story about Alan Alda, they should ask for it.  Maybe something like ""What are anecdotes about Alan Alda that Quora members can share?""It just makes no sense.  If someone is seeking stories about Alan Alda, they aren't going to type ""Who played Hawkeye Pierce on MASH?"" in the Quora search field.I want to see thoughtful questions in my feed so that I can read thoughtful answers and I can write thoughtful answers.  Question askers have as much responsibility to maintain quality on Quora as answerers do.  So, yes, I think it is bad to ask questions on Quora that could be easily answered on Google. It's your responsibility to ask better questions on Quora."

what  causing someone to be jealous	what can i do to avoid being jealous of someone	0	What causes someone to be jealous of another woman's pregnancy? Can it really turn dangerous if someone mistaken someone who is not exactly pregnant, but has an ovarian cyst or uterine fibroid?	How can I stop being clingy and jealous?By being Confident and working on your insecurities.When I say confident, I mean being confident in who you are, what you do and who you are with. Let me share you my personal experience. In my early days of dating I once dated a beauty pageant. It was actually intimidating for me. Why?! Before that I was a book worm throughout my life and had zero girlfriends in my early life. I started doing research work in science and engineering from an early age as well, which gained me some popularity for a time being, which in case gave me some opportunity with women. But because I had limited knowledge of being with opposite sex, so I wasn't sure of myself, on how to be with one. So when I started dating this beauty pageant, I always used to feel overwhelmed.“Am I worthy of being with ‘her’?! Com’on. Look at her. She's a beauty and every one longs to be with her. Why did she choose to date meeeeee????!!” This is what used to go through my mind all the time. You see, I had insecurities (I still have some now) and I wasn't confident of who I was and the fact that I did deserve better.Recently I read a book, “The Truth” by Neil Strauss (author, journalist), which talks about the truth behind most of the relationships, and I agree with most of it. All of us have a wounded child in us. Some of us try to protect that child and some don't or can't. I also had a wounded past, a wounded child within me, which made be clingy and jealous.“What if she leaves me?”“What if she meets someone better?”“What if she is not interested in me any more?”These are few of the many questions which used to go through my mind. All because of my own lack of self confidence and insecuties.It was only through time and experience that made me realise that you can not keep someone by being clingy and jealous. You can not chain a person up and force them to stay with you. If they want to stay, they will stay or else they will leave, sooner or later. All you can do is to be who you are, to be confident on who you are, be confident in what you want and what you do, and do what makes you happy. He or she will be there with you if they want to anyway.Continuing with my story, my clinginess and jealousy paid off, and resulted into a broken relationship. We stopped dating and went separate ways. All because I thought I wasn't worthy enough. But in the process I learnt a valuable lesson in life.Fast forward to present. That lesson helped me to improve as a person and now I am with an amazing person, who loves me for who I am, and I can't be more grateful.
what are the questions should not ask on quora	which question should i ask on quora	0	“Why are all atheists evil and remorseless?”“Why are all theists idiotic and gullible?”“Why are all Republicans racist against POC and sexist against women?”“Why are all Democrats racist against white people and sexist against men?”“My 30 year old daughter got her ears pierced.

Dear Chris,you are spamming Quora with hundreds (11 hundreds at the moment of me writing this answer) of low-quality questions and the empty link to the site Yahoo!Answers. You may argue that questions such asWhere is the belly button located on the human body?Are NASCAR drivers allowed to have a flat top hairstyle?Can kids and teenagers have light golden brown hair?Is it ok for a police officer to be 6 feet tall?Is it fine for a male high school student to have the hair color medium brown?are actually high-quality and very educating, but I assure you, Quora is a very good instrument that could be put to much better use.You are asking what question you should ask. Ask something that will really contribute to your pool of knowledge and can potentially improve your life. Maybe not about Brian Urlacher and Brett Favre again. Maybe not about white briefs again. Maybe do not include the link to Yahoo Answers anymore; not only does it not lead anywhere but to the site itself, but it adds meaningless noise to your questions as a source link and seems to be in poor taste. If you like Yahoo so much, why not ask on Yahoo instead?Quora can be a source of fantastic answers about dinosaurs, medieval literature, the color wheel, black holes, poaching, deadly viruses, social changes of the 20th century, Japanese cinema, meditation practices, etc. If you honestly want to know (and not simply to ask questions just for the sake of adding the Yahoo link), broaden your horizons just a little bit.Be sure that I am not condemning you, but hey, you did ask - and this is my heartfelt advice to you.
how much is 30 kv in hp	where can i find a conversion chart for cc to horsepower	0	I presume that what you wanted to ask was: How much is 30kW in horsepower? If you are actually asking about kV, you would have to answer the question: At what amperage?(A volt is a unit of electrical potential. A watt (volts x amperes) is a measurement of power.)The answer depends (well slightly) upon the type of horsepower. (Yes, there are different types.) For mechanical horsepower the answer is 40.23. For metric horsepower it is 40.79. And for electric horsepower it is 40.21.	There isn’t one. No such direct correlation between the size of an engine and the horsepower an engine makes exists.A 3 liter inline four Mercury marine engine makes 135 horsepower.https://www.mercurymarine.com/en...The same GM 3.0 Liter V6 LFW Engine makes anywhere from 220 to 270 horsepower, depending on what car it’s going into:GM 3.0 Liter V6 LFW Engine
what does it mean that every time i look at the clock the numbers are the same	how many times a day do a clock nonascii s hands overlap	0	I have the same experience since 2012, it does not go away, whenever I check the time to know the time, it is the same numbers, 1:11, 2:22, 3:33, 5:55, 4:44 and …I made a screen shot of each time I check the time, 90% of the time, it is weirdly the same numbers, based on probability it is very unlikely. even when I am sleep, if I get a text and I open my cellphone to read it, when I look at the time it is the same numbers!I decided not to think about it for months, because I thought it makes me crazy, but I still see it every day.Yesterday I was in target store, when the cashier showed me the money on her screen, it was $41.41, I laughed and told her cool, the same numbers, then I checked my cellphone, it was 10:10 pm. I got shocked, it was just like it does not want me to forget it.Again, I got curious about it, can this odd probability be only a coincidence? is it really possible to have the same numbers every day for years!? Today I was looking at the first text I have ever sent to the girl I loved, it was at 10:10 pm! I could not believe it. it is just the most important moments are signed with these numbers in my life.Then I realized something else, I realized that I was born in 1/11/1977The same numbers.This numbers, whatever they are, can not be just a coincidence, it can not be a chorono biological clock either, because 10:10 and 11:11 has no mathematical pattern.I wish there was an answer for this.I am not a man of metaphysics, and it is really bothers me to see that these numbers happen in my life over and over again. There is no message in them, at least I can not interpret any message. Maybe they are some marks in my life, maybe they mean that this life is not real, because if it was, it could not be full of repeated numbers!My girlfriend made a collection of all the screen shots and sent it to me, at least it proves that I am not having illusion.If you have the same experience and have an idea to make any sense of this, please share it with me.Bobbyusb@Yahoo.comThank you:-)Bobby	To overlap, at least one of the two hands must rotate fully. This answer uses the brainless infinite catchup approach, the first three iterations of which are noted:In the time it takes for the minute hand to have made its first full rotation from 12:00, the hour hand reaches 1:00. This means the overlap period is at least 1 hour, i.e. 60 minutes.Now, for the minute hand to catch up to the hour hand, the minute hand must move from 12:00 to at least 1:00. This adds 1/12th of an hour, i.e. 5 minutes, to the overlap period. The total overlap period is now at least 60 + 5 = 65 minutes.In these last 5 minutes, the hour hand has of course moved a bit further still, certainly less than a minute. Using the pattern mentioned earlier, the hour hand has moved exactly 5m*60s/12, i.e. 25 seconds. We’re now at at a total overlap period of at least 65m:25s.To recap, the first three terms were 1 hour, 5 minutes, and 25 seconds. Equivalently, these are 1 hour, (1/12) of an hour, and (1/12) of (1/12) of an hour. These can be rewritten as 1/(12^0), 1/(12^1), and 1/(12^2).If we continue this catchup pattern and do the total, we arrive at the sum of 1/(12^x) for x from 0 to infinity. This adds up to 1.0909… hours or 65.4545… minutes (see the links). The Python code for approximating the same in minutes is sum(60/(12**i) for i in range(15)).Since we now know the overlap period in hours, to determine the number of times it happens in a day, divide 24 by it, i.e. 24/1.0909… , giving us exactly 22. Thus, the hour and the minute hands overlap 22 times a day.

what is web application	what is the web application framework	0	Web Application TestingWhat is Web Application Testing?Web Application Testing is a testing process which will ensure there are no issues on the Web Application and certify whether application is ready to go live or not. . By testing, any organization can be sure that the web application will work perfectly and will be easily accepted by the end-users.http://...http://... Here you can find the checklist for web testing. By using the checklist, user can create test cases for any web based application.User Interface Testing(GUI Testing) : 1.      Content wording used in the web pages should be correct.2.      Wrap-around should occur properly.3.      Instructions used in web pages should be correct (i.e. if you follow each instruction does the expected result occur?)4.      Check image size specifications: Check that at least the text of the page appears quickly.5.      View in text browser: Test each web page in text-only browser, or text-browser emulator. It will help you pick up on badly-chosen or missing ALT texts. 6.      Switch images off: Check that sensible ALT texts have been provided for images.7.      Check sensible page titles.8.      Resolution change effect on web pages9.      Image spacing – To verify that images are displaying properly with text.10.  Print – Printing should be proper.Functional Testing1.      Check for broken links (Broken link refers to a hyperlink which does not work): Manually it’s very difficult to find broken links. There are various tools available to find these, such as:-         Broken Link Check-         Firefox Add-on Pinger 1.0.22.      Validate the HTML: Make sure that you have valid HTML (or XHTML). This can be done with a W3C validator3.      Disable the cookies from your browser settings. If you are using cookies on your site, your sites major functionality will not work by disabling the cookies. See if appropriate messages are displayed. (A cookie is a small piece of information stored as a text file on your computer that a web server uses when you browse certain web sites that you've visited before).4.      Switch JavaScript off: It is important to check that your site still functions with Javascript disabled or provide proper Javascript error message: e.g. “enable Javascript to see animation of Intelligaia Technologies”.5.     Warning messages: Error/warning messages should be flash to user for incorrect inputs.Interface Testing1.      Data display on browser should match with data available on server: To test browser and server interface, run queries on the database to make sure the transaction data is being retrieve and store properly.2.      Error Handling: Make sure system can handle application errors. Compatibility Testing 1.      Test on different Operating systems: Test your web application on different operating systems like Windows (XP, Vista, Win7 etc), Unix, MAC, Linux, Solaris with different OS flavors.2.      Test on different Browsers: Test web application on different browsers like:a.      Firefox, as that has the best standards compliance and is the second most-used browser.b.      Internet Explorer for Windows – currently the most widely used browser (IE6, IE7, IE8).c.       Opera – growing in popularity due to its speed and pretty good standards compliance.3.      Mobile browsing: This is new technology age. So in future Mobile browsing will rock. Test your web pages on mobile browsers. Compatibility issues may be there on mobile. Security Testing 1.      Limit should be defined for the number of tries: Is there a maximum number of failed logins allowed before the server locks out the current user?2.      Verify rules for password selection.3.      Is there a timeout limit?4.      Test by pasting internal url directly into browser address bar without login. Internal pages should not open.5.      Test the CAPTCHA for...	1. Spring MVCOld but gold, Spring MVC is still ahead of the curve after more than a decade since its first release. After its expansion to embrace complete MVC framework, Spring kept on evolving adopting changes and turned into a full-scale Java framework for Internet-facing applications, offering software engineers a powerful toolkit for web application development and application configuration as well as for security projects. Being one of the most favoured among programmers, Spring has a well-developed ecosystem, offering a variety of add-ons to choose from: REST APIs or SOAP web services, security (authentication and authorisation, encryption), etc. Another benefit of this choice is that a big company of fellow developers who chose to use this particular Java framework, too. Thus, they are ready to give you a helping hand with any query you might have.Pros and ConsSpring is not nesting in the top of the charts without reason. It is one of the best and most well-known Java frameworks because of:Simplified injection of test data through the use of POJOs.Enhanced modularity, resulting in better code readability.Loose coupling between different modules.Dependency Injection (DI) flexible use.Although not a direct framework downside, regardless of the piles of reference documentation, Spring MVC might be more than newbie Java devs can chew, making the learning curve too steep. Thus, dealing with some parts of this Java framework can be tough for if you bump into a poorly documented chunk of references. The info you find might be different across versions.By the way, due to our engineers' great experience, Spring MVC is one of our most fancied frameworks.2. Struts 2To elaborate even more on existing Java frameworks that are widely used by modern software engineers, we decided to refer to the successor of Apache’s Struts 1, Struts 2. This Java framework is quite a find for engineers who work with building contemporary Java EE web apps. The Apache Software Foundation has equipped developers with an extensive tool for creating enterprise-ready, web-facing applications, optimizing the development process from the beginning to the final point and post-go-live maintenance. This concept is the right choice if you sweat over high-load systems such as broadcasting portals.Testing the written code takes less effort because of Struts 2's implemented Action class – plain POJO objects. Coupling becomes easier with the framework’s API, helping to tune Interceptors.Pros and ConsWhen you ask yourself why you should consider Struts 2, consider the luxury of not having to override or implement the Action class – it is already in place! Repetitive setup code that IT engineers need to create for several actions is no longer a concern because Interceptors take care of it.However, you might get turned off by the weight of this Java framework: some programmers find it’s not agile enough to go for.3. HibernateAlthough not on RebelLabs’ list either, it is worth mentioning Hibernate when debating the best Java framework. This mapping Java framework cracks object-relational impedance mismatch issues by substituting persisting DB accesses high-level object handling functions. With every enterprise application being one of a kind, Hibernate is equipped with a great feature suite that helps backend developers fine-tune data access layer. This is an advanced ORM framework that lets you perform the database operation on Java objects (entities). It is a persistence concept that utilizes Hibernate cache to persist the data from the Java environment to the database.Pros and ConsHibernate allows you to communicate with any database using tiny alterations in the code you write, bridging the gap between objects and relational words.

does society place too much importance on sports	how do sports contribute to the society	0	"I don't think there's a 'simple answer' or that this question is a simple dichotomy.  I find most simple answers and most basic debates can be boiled down to 'in my opinion/experience'.  That's not a problem, unless we are going to build policy on it and in sport, much of the funding/priority we see through both public projects (school sport and such) and private sponsorship is based on these saccharine sweet, rhetorical stories about the ""power of sport"".  It is at this point where the temptation to cite innumerable personal examples of the positive or negative impact of sport, but please hold those thoughts for a minute.My understanding after being involved in amateur and professional sport as a player, administrator, in governance and even as an owner as well as examining the research on numerous specific 'power of sport' interventions across the US and parts of Europe is that sport is indeed disproportionately powerful, a classic example of a privileged entity that over promises and under-delivers, except for an elite few - and has done this for decades.  Sport is the ultimate venture capital pyramid - big, wide-ranging investment with a tiny proportion of people reaping any rewards at all and 'collateral damage' as a necessary by-product.  In the scheme of the current US election rhetoric, I know this is an automatically divisive idea, but I think the parallel holds some water.'Sport' makes the kind of bold, unregulated promises of return on investment that Lehman's and Fannie May made in the late-1990's and it is only a great, communal fondness for the products of sport, their poignance as a cultural meme and the select positive memories of (and benefits for) a powerful few - not to mention some slickly produced events and well manicured messaging around sport that keeps the realisation of the artificial inflation of the importance of sport, from coming to the front of our minds.  It's a bubble that is more resilient than the housing market, but an alternate reality bubble non-the-less.  Sometimes it's easier to believe this suspension of reality that allows coaches, athletes and administrators of sport who lack any real vision to be so powerful, is somehow 'the way it should be' rather than critically question the role of sport in society.  Sadly, the hero-worship of people without vision only serves to blind huge swathes of society, so I can't endorse it.I have just returned from the SportAccord and International Olympic Committee (IOC) Conference in Québec and despite the obviously necessary nuance around this question, there is something clearly askew with the priority - and in some cases primacy - of sport in society that is demonstrated by the deeply privileged, self-congratualtory, cognitive dissonance that described many of the most powerful people there.  People who rejected the idea of their own disproportionate privilege even as they sat drinking champagne with royalty on the basis of their position in sport alone.  They also reject the idea that putting a ball in a hole is indeed not that important in the scheme of most families, never mind society at large, but I did that for 20 years and both my experience, and the pervasive research seem to back the idea that we all may be backing the wrong horse here.Before you think otherwise, I do believe we can do amazing things with sport (or art or maths or dance - you get the idea...)  I have community centre with 2700 kids a week going through its doors - but it works holistically, working with - and to produce - well-rounded young people, not young athletes. In order for my centre to work, I had to put away my precious ideas about some sports (basketball) being great at teaching 'life-lessons' and others not so much and realised that sport is an empty vessel (at best) and what we fill it with makes the difference (positive or otherwise).  Sadly, much of sport and those who govern and 'teach' it are anti-intellectual, emotionally illiterate, blinkered by raw machismo, institutionally racist, homophobic and misogynist and as such, what they teach and the type of person produced at the end of that experience, is exactly the kind of person who lacerates his shooting hand on a fire hydrant case when he gets frustrated at a game, not to mention the kind of people who's lives disintegrate into relationship breakdown, under-employment and alcoholism once their 'glory days' are over - especially when those glory days end in junior high.There are some great people doing great things through sport, but frankly they are the magic element and if they taught French or Zumba, the participants might be demographically different, but the impact would likely be similar.  My critique is NOT of these people using sport to do good, but rather the lack of public analysis of the appropriate role of sport and insisting that those who administer and coach, do so in a way that produces the outcomes we are so boldly promised.Much of the inordinate primacy of sport is based on a pervasive, anecdotal,  understanding (at least amongst those in power) that sport is always and necessarily a 'powerful teacher of valuable, positive tangential lessons' ('respect', 'teamwork', 'motivation', etc.)  Sadly, the science on these impacts is what good scientists call ""equivocal at best.""  I am tired of the rhetoric of those who believe that sport is, in of itself, somehow magic - that it can make fat children thin, sad children happy, indolent children active and whole communities 'come together', when the truth is, sport does exactly what we make it do, and for the most part with don't demand it does much more than occupy the time of our young people between 3pm and 7; allow men to live vicariously through their children or indeed other men and then entertain us once or twice a week and every four years so long as we make the pact to not ask too many questions or scrutinise it too hard.I don't reject the potential value of sport to society, indeed I embrace it, as I know so many do in the pockets of good practice across the world, but these few pockets do not mitigate the damage done by the unrestrained, unfocused, 'old-fashioned' sport delivered to unwitting participants in schools, community centres and weekend leagues across the world.  There seems to be a sad and dangerous parallel between it's unfettered and unquestioned role in society and those of other institutions that promise much to many and deliver little - sometimes nothing - to most, except those privileged few.And in case you're wondering, there is a solution: we need to increase the abilities of those governing and coaching sport to deliver the tangential psycho-social impacts we have been promised for decades.  These men (and they are mostly men) don't need to become therapists, but they do need to be able to understand that their charges are people first and athletes second, they need to be able to respond appropriately to a crying boy (""Man up!"" does not apply) and be emotionally in-touch enough to know the difference between banter and bullying and strong enough to moderate the former to prevent it becoming the latter, rather than joining in.At the moment we have some of the most interpersonally under-qualified and emotionally vacant people coaching the some of our most vulnerable young people, and if these people think that teaching a child to kick, pass or shoot is the sum of their job, then we - and they - are screwed.I think I digress... but if you've made it this far, perhaps you'd appreciate my other comments on this topic:"	First of all organizing tournament is not only about spending, many people from other nations come to enjoy and cheer there respective teams, thus bringing foreign money, opportunity to earn for people depending upon tourism, sponsors  etc. So if planned properly its not waste of money, you can even earnYou can do exercises, go to gym in place of playing to be fit but playing sports makes you know  how to react in win and lose, even sometimes sports helps in strategy making

how should i prepare for ca final law	how one should know that heshe completely prepare for ca final exam	1	Here you go!First Year of ArticleshipMy CA final attempt was due in Nov 2017 and my preparations did not begin any earlier than other CA Final candidates. I had joined a mid-sized firm in Chennai in April 2015. My batch mates had already started their preparation and had joined various classes while my mind kept repeating that maybe it was too early! After considering facts and combating confusion for days I decided not to study in my first year. I decided to devote that year to cricket and was playing the 5th division of the Tamil Nadu Cricket Association League. Matches were usually held early in the morning, so this decision dint really create any impact my articleship. Apart from cricket, I was also interested in the stock market and started investing and reading about the same. One line summary –no CA Final preparation in the 1st year.Here is my performance in the league (not very great though)BattingBowlingCA Final Preparation in Second Year of ArticleshipHaving missed the bus on purpose in the 1st year, I had to make up for it in the 2nd year. While others were doing one class at a time, I was left with no option but to join two classes simultaneously. I joined FR and AMA in June 2016. I preferred classes over self-study for practical subjects because I always felt that the expert teaching the subject simplifies it and if I were to study the same on my own, I would end up spending twice the time to understand the concepts. I was very attentive in the class (when you sacrifice the early morning sleep, you better pay attention) and ensured that 60% of the preparation was done in my class itself, which is the whole point of joining a coaching class. Once the classes were done in September 2016, there was a 2-month break. I ensured that 80% of the preparation was done in these 2 months for FR and AMA. The focus was more on understanding the concepts rather than solving sums from the material ICAI had provided.The next set of classes began in December 2016 when I joined SFM and DT. Since I missed study in Year 1, I had to catch up on other subjects too. With 2 classes already ongoing, I decided to join Law in February 2017 too. At this stage, I had classes every day morning and evening, and articleship in between. The only reason I used to go home was to sleep. The moment I got into bed, I was almost dead! I literally felt so low at this stage that I decided to quit the Law class. That was when reality hit me hard and I realized that I had become a machine – running in cycles! My day was about getting up, going to class, then office, then again class, home, dinner, study, and sleep……..! Was there a life? No there wasn’t. My heart longed for the field. I was REALLY missing the early morning matches. I was desperate for a break but then that was a far fetched dream! And then one day it hit me that I hadn’t touched my cricket bat for almost a year! How could I stay away from the one thing I loved? The CA Final course had made me ignorant of everything beautiful I was surrounded by! Just when SFM and DT were about to get over, the registration for IDT classes had begun and batches were starting from the very next day. Break had become a Utopian concept then!IDT started in April 2017 and I just didn’t like the class. I quit it midway and started to prepare for the subject on my own. But then AMA and ISCA were also to be focused on! So well! I guess my summer of 2017 was planned!CA Final Preparation Plan in Study LeaveNot sure if this was the break I was looking for!

what  one thing you would like to do better	what  one thing you do despite knowing better	0	Well, unfortunately (or fortunately), there are many things I would like to do better. I would like to:Become a prodigy at Physics, Computer Science and Mathematics (Thank God, I didn't include all other subjects).Develop my personality (and grace the world with my charisma!).Dance and sing better (I am very poor at these).Become a better leader and take better decisions.Become a people's person (I am an introvert).Be proactive and not laze around.I would like to improve these things for now. Well, that doesn't mean I am great at all other stuff. I am so poor at thinking that I'm still trying to figure out my weaknesses. (Just kidding!!)	I always think I'll study later in the night.Fact is I can never pull an all-nighter. In fact I work at 1/10 of my regular speed after 11 pm. And if I'm beyond 3pm, I'm gonna sleep the whole next day.But I still do it.All due to my habit of procrastination.

what game of thrones villain would be the most likely to give you mercy	what game of thrones villain would you most like to be at the mercy of	1	I agree with other answers over here. The probability of Nights King dishing out mercy is much more likely than expecting mercy from the Boltons, Cersei or any other dubious characters on the show.The mercy meter can be measured only by the number of people spared by a character. And quite surprisingly, the Nights Kings has the highest mercy rate among the characters the OP mentioned.He let Jon go at the Battle of Hardhome. He let Bran go after marking him.His plans or motives for letting these characters go might be dark but still I am going to count them as mercy, especially in the case of Jon.The Nights King isn't human and expectation of mercy from a non-human is a laughable concept but GRRM/ showrunners in their own ways have tried to convey the message that sometimes humans are way worse than our worst nightmares.

does  america  government still blacklist employment etc some  america  citizens because their political views	how is the average speed of gas molecules determined	0	I strongly believe such a policy exists in the United States since we live in the post-911 era of mass surveillance and in a quasi police state. And I believe I am an example of someone on the federal government’s employment blacklist and on the federal government’s much worse (persecution and attempted murder) list because of my political views… I am currently seeking political asylum beyond the borders of United States of America. My life is in very grave danger in the United States of America.I do not believe in America, and America does not believe in me…May Lord GOD help me and protect me. Thank you, Lord GOD! Amen!	Imagine you are holding a party balloon. A balloon maintains its shape because inside that balloon are more than a sextillion independent gas molecules flying around at high speed, bouncing off of every part of the interior surface, pushing it outwards. If I walk up and pop the balloon with a pin, what do you expect to happen?Each of those gas molecules instead of hitting the inside surface of the balloon will continue traveling in a straight line, away from where the balloon once was. They will continue on those trajectories until they hit something (e.g. another gas molecule or dust in the air) or their velocity is decreased to zero, by gravity.The ISS is analogous to a giant balloon – not so much in that its shape is held by the trapped gas – it isn’t, aluminum holds the shape – but that inside the ISS there are many, many septillions of gas molecules zipping around inside it. Those gas molecules fly into walls and bounce off towards another wall. They bounce off of each other. That’s the natural state of trapped gas.But if we were to make a hole in the ISS, any gas molecules that, in their journeys, crossed the surface of that hole into space, would continue traveling out into space. There is nothing out there for them to bounce off of and return back in through the hole. These gas molecules are traveling at about half a kilometer per second. There is no “sucking” happening, there is simply an open door and eventually everything inside would go outside and have no reason to come back inside.The Earth doesn’t have a balloon surface around it to hold the atmosphere in. The atmosphere remains where it is, even though the gas molecules in the atmosphere are also traveling at around half a kilometer per second, because of gravity. The Earth is a massive object, so it has a significant gravitational field. A gas molecule that hits the ground at 500 m/s and bounces off, heading straight upwards will not escape because first, it will hit many other gas molecules that change its trajectory, many, many times per second, but because of gravity, any upward velocity will gradually decrease.For a moment, let’s ignore the molecules above our bouncing molecule that cause a trajectory change with each collision, and let’s just look at what gravity will do to a single upward traveling molecule. What will happen? What does Sir Isaac say?Sir Isaac's First Law of Motion tells us that......every object will remain at rest or in uniform motion in a straight line unless compelled to change its state by the action of an external force.There is only one force acting upon our lone rising molecule - gravity.With every second, gravity is decelerating our lone molecule by 9.8 m/s^2 (32.2 ft/s^2). So, we can calculate the height the molecule will reach:our initial velocity is 511 m/s (1676 ft/s) and our acceleration is -9.8 m/s^2 (-32.2 ft/s^2). That gives a height reached of 13,322.5 m (43,709 ft). Once our molecule reaches that height, its vertical velocity will be zero, and it will begin to fall.So, how fast would our molecule have to be traveling to escape? There is a concept called escape velocity that determines how fast an unpropelled object will travel with gravity as its decelerant. The idea being that the object will continually slow but gravity will continually weaken as the object gets farther away. At escape velocity, the speed will hit zero at distance infinity.G is the gravitational constant (6.67E-11), M is the mass of Earth (5.97E24), and r is the radius of Earth (6378100)That gives us an escape velocity of 11,179.365 m/s (36,677.7 ft/s).Now, remember that our molecule’s speed of around 511 m/s (1676 ft/s) was the average speed of a nitrogen molecule. Some nitrogen molecules are moving slower, which means some are moving faster. A small percentage may actually be moving at or above 11,179.365 m/s (36,677.7 ft/s) and could possible escape (although as we discussed earlier, they are likely to hit other molecules and transfer some of their kinetic energy to those molecules, and slow down).We've been talking about nitrogen, but it isn't the only gas in our atmosphere. There is an expression of kinetic temperature that can be derived from the ideal gas law:The kinetic energy is proportional to the temperature of the gas. So, if our volume of gas is at a certain temperature, molecules with less mass must have greater (average) velocity to compensate. That tells us that molecules less massive than nitrogen have an average speed greater than the average speed of nitrogen. Hydrogen, for example, has an average speed of 1930 m/s (6,332 ft/s). Still not fast enough for the average molecule to escape, but a small amount will be moving fast enough to escape. And in fact we see that. About 95,000 tons of hydrogen manage to escape our atmosphere each year. But don't get too worried, that's only 0.00000000000017% of the Earth's supply of hydrogen.This deceleration is caused by gas molecules moving away from the center of the Earth having to climb up through Earth’s gravity well. Gas molecules moving away from the ISS isn’t really comparable. The ISS doesn’t have a massive gravitational impact. There is nothing to decelerate the movement of a gas molecule away from the center of the ISS, except the walls of the ISS. Take those walls away and the molecules quickly disperse into low Earth orbit. Whether or not they leave low Earth orbit is dictated by the problem we just worked.
what is the best travel website in spain	what is the best travel website	0	There are lots of travel sites in Spain, you can use below site best for plan you holiday or tell me i can help you and make plan as per your requirmentSpain 2016: Best of Spain Tourism - TripAdvisor	So this is a listing of all the websites that I have found useful during planning my trips.http://Wikitravel.com - This is my travel bible. I literally 100's of pages of printouts from this website. Whenever I plan, the first website that I always visit is this. And it hardly every disappoints. Most of the travel locations in the world are listed here. And since it is crowd-sourced, people write the most meaningful information here, and it often sounds like a personal blog. You will find relevant information about how to get to a location, accommodation, eating options, things to do, things to see - everything on the same page. Under accommodation listings you will mostly find the 3 kinds of options - budget, mid-range, or splurge. Truly my bible for travel planning.http://Tripadvisor.com - The quintessential website for planning any trip. Probably the most exhaustive listing of places to visit, hotels, local attractions. Nobody ever plans a trip without going to this website at least once. http://Youtube.com - Porn is about the only thing you cannot find here. Travel logs, video logs, local culture - everything you need to know about where you are going can be found here. And its quite fascinating too to see so many videos about one place - so many different perspectives. I watched the whole documentary series by BBC on the Himalayas before leaving for Himachal. And it was quite an experience to see first-hand some of the stuff I had seen on video.Lonely Planet - This is my last resort website. They seem too high handed. And generally I have had a bad experience going to all those places that have been recommended by Lonely Planet.There are millions out there who run travel blogs and share their experiences. Its best to just google search and read through those blogs once before you leave.

why do some people think obama will try to take their guns away	has there been a gun control initiative to take away guns people already own	0	Just because he says he doesn't want to take away our guns doesn't mean that's true. After all, rewind just a few months and you'll find him saying he would like to emulate Australia's gun laws. In case you don't know, Australia banned guns and confiscated existing guns in 1996. Diane Feinstein, Janet Reno, Hillary Clinton, and other high level politicians have said the same thing. They want to eventually ban guns. Fortunately for us, the law says they can't and the majority agrees. however, by changing small laws and introducing others, over time, there will be a de facto gun ban since they will simply be too expensive and onerous to own and buy for the average person.  for some reason, anti gun people can't or won't see past the immediate action. On paper it's not big deal. After all I think everyone wants to keep guns away from criminals and others who would use them for evil. Those of us on the other side however, who have seen this show many times, and have a vested interest, know that there are simply more laws and restrictions in the future when criminals continue to illegally get guns and crazy people keep shooting up public spaces. So next, we'll have a mandatory registration, and then who knows what after that. Taxes on our newly registered guns probably. mandated insurance since they know who has guns now. Just like Obamacare, mandatory insurance will be unaffordable for the majority. One of the main problems with this issue is that anti gun people don't want a gun and don't care about those of us who do. They will remove all our rights without a second thought because it doesn't affect them. What they don't realize is that it could affect them indirectly but by then it will be too late. the ship will have already sailed.	"In any case I have tried to look up where there were gun control laws or gun registration, there were later confiscations and often genocide.Of course it isn't just guns... the reason some martial arts developed was because the rulers banned other weapons. An unarmed populace is easier to exploit. Here is a nice list of some cases on gun control and confiscation: Death by ""Gun Control""Some of these cases are from:  A Little Gun History LessonAnd I am looking up in what cases confiscation occurred as a result of the laws. more references here: Gun Control and GenocideGermanyGermany established gun control in 1938 and from 1939 to 1945, leaving a populace unable to defend itself against the Gestapo and SS.  Hundreds of thousands died as a result.   Gun politics in Germany This video indicates their were confiscations. Eyewitness: Yes, The Nazis Did Confiscate Our Guns  Interesting and thoughtful reply to Kitty Werthmann...said that the real way to catch criminals (we still had a few) was bymatching serial numbers on guns. Most citizens were law abiding anddutifully marched to the police station to register their firearms. Notlong after-wards, the police said that it was best for everyone to turn intheir guns. The authorities already knew who had them, so it was futile notto comply voluntarily.China in 1999China melts confiscated gunsApr. 12, 1997 10:42 AM ETBEIJING (AP) _ More than 15,000 firearms were melted down at Beijing's Capital Iron and Steel Complex as part of China's drive to crack down on ownership of illegal weapons and other crimes.Armenia:   http://www.mercyseat.net/gun_gen... After the government of the Ottoman Empire quickly crushed an Armenian revolt in 1893, tens of thousands of Armenians were murdered by mobs armed and encouraged by the government. As anti-Armenian mobs were being armed, the government attempted to convince Armenians to surrender their guns. [4] A 1903 law banned the manufacture or import of gunpowder without government permission. [5] In 1910, manufacturing or importing weapons without government permission, as well as carrying weapons or ammunition without permission was forbidden. [6] During World War I, in February 1915, local officials in each Armenian district were ordered to surrender quotas of firearms. When officials surrendered the required number, they were executed for conspiracy against the government. When officials could not surrender enough weapons from their community, the officials were executed for stockpiling weapons. Armenian homes were also searched, and firearms confiscated. Many of these mountain dwellers had kept arms despite prior government efforts to disarm them. [7]UgandaUganda established gun control in 1970. From 1971 to 1979, 300,000 Christians, unable to defend themselves, were rounded up and exterminated. The total dead are said to be 2-3 million Kopel, Gallant & Eisen on Uganda & Gun Control on National Review OnlineBy May 2002, reports of fierce resistance from the remaining armed Karamojong began to trickle out, despite government attempts to suppress knowledge of that resistance and of the army's brutality. The Catholic Church charges that thousands of residents were displaced from Karamoja after their homes were torched by UPDF troops in the disarmament campaign. By mid-July, the total number of confiscated guns had reached 10,000 — only about 25 percent of the expected total.CambodiaCambodia established gun control in 1956.

i am a 19yearold how can i improve my skills or what should i do to become an entrepreneur in the next few years	i am a 19 year old guy how can i become a billionaire in the next 10 years	0	What are some potential low-cost businesses that can be started and operated by a teenager? I have $1000 to work with. I am an Eagle Scout, and speak proficiently in Spanish. Some ideas are vending machines, gumball machines, or lawn care service.	I’m turning 28 this year.I thought I’d never become a millionaire by the age of 30. But I guess I’m closer to it than ever.I created a highly profitable business in 2017 and this year we’re looking to clear closer to 250k. By my prediction, in 2 years, we’re going to hit a million.You might be wondering what kind of business I started.I don’t mind sharing. But before I share my success, I always wanted to take a moment to tell you that I have failed twice consecutively before I came up with this winning idea.Before I started experimenting with business ideas, I used to climb the corporate ladder.So, what are my failed and successful ventures?Failed venturesGift card reselling( 1 billion+ market)Ebay Drop-shippingSuccessful VentureAirbnb Rental ArbitrageLet’s explore them very quickly.Ebay DropshippingI started an Ebay dropshipping store in 2017. I’ve made probably $5000 in sales. Not a lot, but enough for me to understand my thruput.Throughput = (time invested in researching for product ideas/niches + time running the dropshipping store) / the profit (revenue minus item costs)So for example, I’d spend time researching for a niche product to sell on ebay, let’s say, snow gloves, and then I’d create an ad on ebay to dropship the snow gloves that I found from Alibaba.Let’s assume the gloves go for $15 on Alibaba and I would charge 1.4x of the original cost, so 15 * 1.4 = 21 dollars.21 dollars minus ebay and paypal fees = 19 dollars.My net profit would be $4. I’d earn 4 dollars for every 21 dollars. That means my profit margin would be roughly 19%.Well, 19% is still not a bad profit margin. Just to give you a reference point, Apple’s products are around 38%.Gift Card ResellingI gave up on the business idea after 2 weeks. I found that this market was dominated by 3 big players with millions of funding.Airbnb Rental ArbitrageI’ve been doing this for over a year now. My profit margin varies from month to month, but it averages from 42% to 58%.This all depends on occupancy rate and the time of the year. Most businesses struggle with above 20% margins.What is Airbnb Arbitrage?In this case, you are renting a property out at a lower price and subleasing it out via Airbnb at a higher price. For example, you lease a 1-bedroom apartment at $1,000 dollars a month and rent out the same 1-bedroom for $2,000 dollars a month on Airbnb. Your net profit is $1k a month.The more units you open up, the more cash flow you’ll be able to generate.Best part about this business model is that you lease homes and not own them. Once the business is up and running, I spend only a few hours each week managing the business.Hope this helps!P.S. I teach other entrepreneurs how to build an Airbnb business on PassiveAirbnb.com
when a girlfriend asks her boyfriend why did you choose me what makes you want to be with me what should one reply to her	my girlfriend said that we should end this because she is confused about her feelings for me i wished her well and disconnected should i call her and ask her if she wants to get back together	0	"Tell her that you will answer that AFTER she tells you exactly “why she chooses you, what makes her want to be with you?”….Ive replied in that fashion twice in my time with women that sprung that question on me (if I recall both occasions were late at night when I was tired).The response on both occasions was as follows: a long drawn out pause….followed by, a long drawn out pause…..then…she says “""well I asked you first!”….the whole point being, it's a tough answer to turn into words immediately for any male, let alone for a female that is much more in tune with their emotional side etc…..Oh, and whilst awaiting their attempt to roll an answer straight off the bat, use that small window of opportunity to desperately work out how to put your own reasons into words, because if you don't, you will be immediately guilty of something sinister or negative!….ha ha!….the wonder of women eh. :)"	"In dating I've always lived by this philosophy, ""There's a reason why rocket ships don't have rear view mirrors.""Relationships are hard (for many reasons) but they're made worse by some of the unnecessary stuff which people do, like saying ""I'm confused about my feelings"" What does that even mean? <--said totally rhetorically :)As hard as relationships are, I'm always one to say try to fix things BUT don't even try to fix a relationship with someone who leaves you for a pointless reason. You're a rocket ship - you're trying to reach the stars in romance, career and other things. Don't waste fuel slowing down and looping back to things which don't make sense. If your boss at work said, ""We're not really sure how we feel about you sitting at this desk? Why don't you stop coming to work from now on?"" Would you go home and wonder whether you should call your boss and ask if she's rethought her feelings about you at that desk? Probably not...But because you care about this girl you hope that you can make the same mistake and get a positive response. Sadly you won't - tell your rocket pilot to accelerate away - what you thought was a star, was just space debris. Best of luck. "

If possible try to follow a popular news channel regularly and whatever you follow for current affairs from newspapers, you should note down those regularly and if you regularly invest 1 - 1.30 hours for current affairs, it is enough for you and especially for some burning topics you should always focus on the background or the real cause of those burning news topics as well as try to know the influence of those burning issues on our present scenario in our society and in our country as well.For the more you may follow the monthly current affairs of VISION IAS and INSIGHT IAS, IAS today.in as well as you may follow Press Information Bureau, PRS | Home ( these two are very good as well as helpful too) and the websites of various ministries of our central government too.How to proceed for reading newspapers and how to make notes from newspapers …………………………….First of all, I want to say that before going to follow any newspaper for UPSC exam, you should keep three things in your mind -Which newspaper you should follow.What you should follow from newspapers and how you should follow.How you will make notes from newspapers.so, now how to start……………………At first, pick the right one which is apt for UPSC exam because if you don’t follow the right one, you will face lots of difficulties. That’s why I will like to suggest you follow the HINDU or the Indian Express but where the maximum number of candidates follow the HINDU, I'll like to suggest you follow the HINDU otherwise you can follow the Indian Express. Both the newspapers are equally good in quality so you can pick up any newspaper between these two mentioned above.Next important part is what to follow and how to followHow to follow any news from newspapersBefore going to follow any news from newspapers, you should keep two things in your mind and those are…………………….Background of any newsInfluence or effects of that news in the present scenario of our country.Here, I am drawing an ex...	Detailed Account of the UPSC Preparation from scratchI feel privileged today to share my two cents on civil services preparation. Before I begin let me clearly state that there is no magic wand to clear civil services. Also there is no correlation of intelligence and high aptitude with chances of selection in civil services. Most of the people who crack it are no indifferent (at one point of time even they were a part of the herd and felt the same uncertainty of clearing up this exam).But yes something worked for them, that made them successful.I would like to list down some of the most important components which you will find common in preparation of all successful candidates. We can call them as Basic Pillars of UPSC PreparationA timetable and strategy: Nothing is possible without proper planning, a daily timetable and short/long term goals setting. So plan and timetable is the first pillar.A strong foundation and conceptual clarity: it is important to ensure whatever we read, we understand it thoroughly. UPSC questions are very much applied, they need analysis and that can come only when we are crystal clear with our concepts of subject matter.Consolidation and revision: The syllabus is like a vast ocean, it is important to keep consolidating and revising it time and again. So make notes and continuously revise every now and then.Evaluation of Preparation: At every point of time you should know where your preparation stand, that is possible through self-evaluation and evaluation through tests.Consistency: Nothing happens without it. People who show consistency are sure shot to be rewarded, provided they work smartlyDiscussions and Answer writing: Discussions are very important, they will help in clearing your doubts & better understanding of subject matter. Similarly Answer writing has a very important role, knowledge without ability to express and articulate is futile. It is important to develop the ability to deliver in 8 minutes.Being Optimistic: This is the last but the most important one. UPSC is a time taking process, full of obstacles and failures. How to cope up with them, keeping yourself motivated is the biggest key to success.I will discuss each of the above point in detail sometime later. Also I shall take up discussion on soft aspects like right time to start preparation, should job be left, need of a backup, how do I decide why civil services etc. Clarity on all this is must before giving a full-fledged effort for preparation.Now let us discuss how to prepare for civil services.Pre –Preparation ModeThe initial two-three months are very confusing. People are generally not able to understand what to read, how to make notes, which newspaper to refer and other plethora of questions coming to their minds. What most people end up doing is they join a coaching thinking it to be a solution to all problems , others blindly start following some senior who himself is misdirected. This is a very crucial stage and I feel most of the people lose their momentum here because of a faulty start and they find very difficult to realign later.So starting has to be steady and sober. I think it is important to give at least two months to yourself to get yourself in UPSC mode. Start reading newspapers and noting them down, basic NCERT’s of economics, Polity & other basic ones, some good blogs/book etc. This will not only help in giving you a foundation but also help in taking informed decisions related to preparation (estimation of time you will need, need of coaching, should job be continued, optional choice etc.). This will act as a trial and error time where you can learn how to make notes, how to read books, learn from others etc. So this will make things smooth in your preparation be it self or through coaching.I shall discuss in detail how to go about in pre-preparation modePreparation ModeWhen you start your preparation, have...
what is the stall speed and aoa of an f14 with wings fully swept back	why did aircraft stop using variablesweep wings like those on an f14	0	The CADC (Central Air Data Computer) automatically programed the wing sweep.  However when that failed, the manual schedule for the A model (and probably for all), using IMN, or Indicated Mach Number, was:0.4 IMN - 20 degrees0.7 IMN - 25 degrees0.8 IMN - 50 degrees0.9 IMN - 60 degrees1.0 IMN - 68 degrees	"There are a lot of good answers on this thread.  It's true that we learned a lot about variable-geometry wings, their weight and drag penalties, and their weird behavior in certain airspeed regimes as we evolved the F-111, the F-14 and the B-1.  However, some of the cited articles (and a lot more not cited) call out what's probably the strongest reason for abandoning this kind of design: software can adjust aerodynamic and flight control performance better than hardware can.  These days, we just don't need mechanical contrivances to make aircraft fly the way we want them to.As an aside, in the safety community, the impressive complexity of wing sweep systems always was accompanied by some hand-wringing about the possibility of an ""asymmetric wing sweep,"" where the wings don't mirror each other's position: See The story of F-14A, Aircraft No. 3, BuNo. 157982.  However, if memory serves, at best there might have been exactly one instance of this happening to an aircraft in service -- I think it was an F-14, and I'm confident that it got down safely.  (If anybody has back issues of the Naval Safety Center's Approach magazine, I think that's where I read about it many moons ago.)To my knowledge, neither an F-111 or a B-1 ever has encountered this kind of malfunction.  (That's probably a good thing.)"
why do slavs squat	will squats make my legs thicker	0	"I'll try to be serious and answer this question the best way I can. I have never heard of this internet phenomenon of ""Slav squatting"" until now, and I find it absolutely hilarious. I thought the whole world was squatting just like we are. You may laugh, but I am actually squatting on my chair while writing this. Now to the point. I will write from my point of view, and I don't know if it applies to the other people (Slavic people).First thing first: squatting simply feels comfortable for me. I lay my feet flat on the ground, my knees bent, and I rest my whole upper body on my knees and hamstrings. Sometimes I also squat on balls of my feet, putting few of my fingers on the ground for aditional stability.Sadly, most present day teenage and adult Slavs grew up in impoverished post-socialist countries. There were no videogames, and we didn't spent much time watching TV (There were only 3 channels in my country, none of them for the kids). We spent our time in parks and outdoors running, playing soccer, immitating cowboys and Indians, playing war games, and doing other silly things that (Slavic) kids do. When you get tired, you could either sit on the ground, as most parks and playgrounds didn't have benches, and get dirty, or squat. So squatting came naturally and became a habit for most kids.Also, most toilets in schools were squatting toilets, so that had some influence too. Even today I squat on my modern flush toilet. It simply feels better.Now for the photo thing. That comes from the pure utility: class photos were taken every year, and to make whole class of 30 student fit in one photo, boys were usually squatting in the first row, and girls were standing behind them in the second row. So the boys gained habit of taking photos in squatting position. Eventually, it became cool to take photos while squatting.I am sorry for my bad english, and I hope I gave you some insight on this squatting habit of ours."	Whether or not squats make your legs thicker is dependant on a various factors.Firstly, your training routine.If you are a beginner, you should be following a beginner training routine to make sure you are getting the adequate amount of stress on the muscles, without going overboard and messing up your recovery cycle. I would highly recommend checking out some beginner programs at https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness... if you are not currently following a proven program.Your dietTo gain as much muscle as possible, you should be in a caloric surplus and eating a high amount of protein so that your muscles can recover quickly. A Calorie Calculator provides you with a good estimation of how much protein, carbohydrates and fats you should be eating daily to achieve your specific goals. You can find out other reasons why people like to take whey protein at my complete quora answer here.Getting enough restThis goes hand and hand with the other factors. You need to be able to recover from your workout session so that you can keep training hard and tearing muscle fibers to get your legs thicker. Make sure you are getting at least 8 hours of sleep every night. This is crucial to being able to consistently keep pushing yourself.

when can i expect my cognizant confirmation mail	when can i expect cognizant confirmation mail	0	When you say you got selected I assume that you have got the offer letter with you atleast. In this case rest assured you will get the joining/on-boarding confirmation mail sooner or later depending on the requirements of the company. Incase you didn't get any written confirmation from company after your interview I would suggest you not to loose heart and would request you to keep trying for other companies rather than waiting for confirmation from Cognizant. The confirmation will come if it has to but you shouldn't waste your time on a single company. There are multiple opportunities outside waiting for you.	I have given my Technical and HR round on 1st April 2015 and got a call on 5th April 2015 from cognizant that I am selected in the interview, this was the only thing I have to tell my parents, without any confirmation mail. Things got right for few days , than it started giving me depression that why haven’t I got any mail , scary thoughts started coming in my mind that Was the campus drive fake..? blah blah …!!After few months of frustration and depression one sudden morning I got a mail from CTS ( cognizant technology solutions) that was my offer letter stating all the package information which I ‘ll be getting. I got that mail on 28th July 2015. After that I have to do all the online portal formalities of CTS than again no information regarding joining date after few months and I got a mail regarding my joining date as 16th February 2016. Hope this will help you. :)
can i make 50000 a month by day trading	can i make 30000 a month by day trading	0	You can !!For that , you need to have at least a $25000 trading account so that you can trade 5 lots where 1 pip = $50.Since you wanted to earn $50 000 a month and there is at least 20 Trading days in a month, you should at least make $2500 per day to achieve your monthly target.If you are trading 5 lots ( $50 per pip), you will only need to catch 50 pips per day to achieve your target.The best pair to trade would be the gbp/jpy since it moves at least 100 pips per day,so catching 50% of that move will be easy.The most important part of this plan is a profitable strategy that can allow you to catch 50 pips everyday.Remember: any amount of earnings is possible if you have a profitable strategy to allow you to catch the number of pips you need for your target.	I day trade on the futures every day. My AIM is 1K per day which I usually do achieve at times I lose but most months I am over my AIM of 20K. Now you can increase your risk profile and aim slightly a higher where you could achieve over 30K a month.This was last Friday - that week I have been up over 45K, so yes if you can risk a little more than average which is (3–6) contracts. Plus because of the elections in the USA was trading after hours.However when I lose 1K per trading day I will end my day and await for the next trading day. I will not over risk myself on markets because you won't be forgiven.Of course you need to have trading skills to do what I do, you need to have a plan setup - risk management and control of your emotions.
is being a good kid and not being a rebel worth it in the long run	is being bored good for a kid	0	The consequences awaiting the vast majority of ‘rebels’ simply haven’t shown themselves yet. They may look like they are getting away with something but they are far more likely (not necessarily, of course, but definitely more likely) to be losers in the long run.Why?What happens in the long term to those who drink at an early age?Well, they are more likely to make even more bad decisions, of course (alcohol’s primary effect is to tell the brain “everything is ooookay,” especially when it isn’t). But they are also more likely to be unable to function in social situations with others without relying on alcohol, never learn to cope with stress except through alcohol, etc. These are skills that must be learned over an extended time and regular use of alcohol gets in the way of that.What happens to the rebel who regularly smokes?They are more likely to become addicted to the nicotine. And there’s a multibillion dollar industry full of chemists, psychologists and marketers standing by to make sure their future includes paying huge amounts of money to the tobacco company. If that happens to cost the rebel a lung, so be it; They’ve got shareholder value to improve and duping younger people into smoking are the means to that end.What happens to rebels who have promiscuous sex?They don’t learn what’s valuable in relationships. Maybe they learn to objectify people instead of learning to understand them. They may emotionally harm themselves or others (who weren’t as casual about the sex as they thought they would be). Maybe they catch a disease. And maybe they wind up starting a pregnancy at an age when they are completely unprepared for the huge responsibility of bringing a life into the world. (I am not an anti-sex zealot by any stretch, but do think people should recognize sex as something they should think carefully about, especially when young.)And what happens when the rebel skips out on their education?Without an education the rebel is more likely to make all the mistakes above and then some. They miss out on the knowledge that was offered to them, but more importantly: They never learn how to work hard. You may not realize it, but the bigger gift of all those school assignments is in how they teach people to work diligently towards goals (especially when that activity is not one’s favourite thing in the world), which is the foundation of achieving just about anything worthwhile. (If someone is skipping their classes to go work on their broader education in some meaningful way this can be a good thing, but I’m assuming that’s not what you’re talking about.)The more of these things someone “rebels” with, the more likely they are to limit their future options. (And generally, having options is the key to long term happiness.)Rebelling against the status quo is of incredible value to society and is how we make progress. Heck, there are many worthwhile causes that could use more rebels to work on them. But those who habitually “rebel” through these relatively trivial actions are selling their futures tragically short.	No - kids are naturally curious and active, both physically and mentally. They are sponges, eager to learn all kinds of things about their world and life. Research suggests it is good for kids to have summer camps, cooking classes, chess classes, and all sorts of extracurricular activities. BUT, there is a limit. If you over schedule a kid with extracurricular activities, you could prevent them from learning what truly interests them. Not only that, they could feel as though you only love them for their accomplishments. A parent’s role is to prepare their child to take their place in society and make a meaningful contribution to their world. Therefore, I would submit that it’s not so much boredom as leisure time that is important. Leisure time is what allows kids and adults to daydream and get creative.
what is the quickest way to increase instagram followers	how can we increase our number of instagram followers	0	Growing your account on Instagram is both difficult and time consuming, but with enough diligent effort you can inevitably grow your account steadily over time.Here’s what I think you can do to grow your account without Hashtags (although I feel they are quite important to IG growth).First this is what not to do;Don’t use Follow/Unfollow. I know.. I’m going against what a lot of people say but hear me out. This method was great 3–4 years ago, before Instagram had such a sophisticated algorithm. Now it’s almost inevitable your account will be labeled as a spam account. IG’s system categorizes accounts based on 3 criteria; Spam, User, Influencer. If you’re following and unfollowing 300, 400, 500 accounts a day, then the system realizes that this is not “normal” human behaviour. Nobody really uses IG in that nature, unless they’re a bot. IG hates bots and makes it an effort to shutdown those automated social media tools everyday.Another reason Why F/U method is not the greatest is because of it’s basis; people will ONLY follow you back as a courtesy and not because they truly love your content. This doesn’t build an engaged audience as they are mindlessly following whoever follows them. Then your account will become more of tool rather than a vehicle to share your content.2. Don’t pay for or buy fake followers. This is bad because it’s something that is going to ruin your accounts engagement rate in the long run. ER (engagement rate) is the average likes+comments you get on your posts / your follower amount. Most decent engagement rates hang around 3%-5%.Now What you should do.Post Great content consistently. Social Media is to share content and it’s the basis of what keeps these platforms alive. If you’re not feeding your account with the fuel it needs to run properly, you can’t expext any sort of decent following what so ever.Post at the right times. User apps such as UNUM (iOS/Android) to see what your best time are, so that you can get the most engagement and get more exposure.Create or get invited to DM Groups. Reach out to accounts in your niche and create what’s called a DM Group. These are groups that are made on the app itself, 15 max, in which all participants agree to like+comment on each others posts as soon as possible.Use relevant hashtags. Hashtags are the basis of exposure on social media, as people that are interested in certain topics use them to look for stuff they’re interested in. Start by looking at what tags accounts you look up to use and then start compiling a list of related ones. Make sure to circulate your tags as you don’t want to be shadowbanned for using the same ones repetitively.Use these tips and I’m sure your account will grow!	So, now we know what we are looking for in our Instagram followers, let’s have a chat about how to get them.DO NOT BUY Followers!!First of all, at some point your real fans will begin to notice and your credibility will be shot for good. Second of all, fake accounts don’t engage with your content, they just sit there, taking up space. This means that the algorithms used by social media to determine what is popular and what isn’t will see your account with its thousands of followers and little to interaction and will determine that your content is not engaging. This will lead to your content being put to the bottom of the pile with little chance of reaching featured status.So, How Then?Big no-no for building your Instagram following, but we are here to talk about the right way to do things. Here are some legitimate and non-spammy ways to build your profile’s popularity.1. The first thing you need to do is choose a focus for your account and avoid anything irrelevant to that focus.2. If your account is to promote your business then try to avoid pictures of your lunch or you hanging out with friends. 3. Then you want to make your account look good, with your focus in mind.4. An interesting description and profile picture will help, but what you really want to focus on is your photo feed.5. Around twenty photos that match your focus is a good place to start.6. If you are using Instagram for business then don’t make every picture a promotion or advertisement or you will put people off right away. 7. Take and post some beautiful pictures that are relevant to your field. For example, if you run an outdoors activity shop, take some photos of the scenery next time you are out for a walk and put those up.8. Delete old photos if necessary and adopt a quality over quantity mantra.9. On the subject of quantity, take care with how many photos you upload at once. People can get annoyed if the accounts that they follow are too prolific. 10. You want to post regularly, but never batch-upload. A good rule of thumb is no more than a single photo within a six hour period. More than this and your followers will feel like you are spamming them and may unfollow you.11. If people comment positively on your photos then be sure to thank them. Just a single word response will make them feel like their comment is appreciated and that you are more than just a passive poster. 12. Similarly, you should interact with the people that you follow. If you see a photo that you like, don’t just say “nice pic” or something generic like that. Instead try to say something meaningful about why you like the picture. The followers of the person you are commenting on will be more likely to check you out if you do.13. Use your other networks and channels to promote your Instagram. Due to it being owned by the same company, the network interacts very well with Facebook and you should use this to your advantage. Consider adding a feed of your photos to your blog as well. Do you use Instagram? If so, what are your top tips for gaining and keeping engaged followers? Please let me know in the comments.
how did darth vader fought darth maul in star wars legends	does quora have a character limit for profile descriptions	0	That happened in a comic book called Star Wars Tales, issue 9. It was kind of like the “Infinities” comics, where they just did a bunch of non canon stuff that they thought would be cool.It was actually a clone of Darth Maul.There was a ton of stuff like that going on back then that the mixed up book and comic EU even considered fake “what if “ stories, mainly just for fun.Look up Star Wars Infinities Omnibus if you're interested in seeing more.	Thank you, Nathan Arbeh, for asking me.All of the other answers on this subject are correct and well-taken. I add mine with more freighted language because I disagree with the path Quora is taking, and I will candidly frame it in those terms. Quora wants to force questions and answers into specific templates whether questioners or answerers like it or not. The sorts of Q&A that will be affected least by this are hard science questions. Anything that involves more humanistic concepts becomes, inherently, devalued. People will continue to applaud exemplary first person narratives, but only for their crowd-pleasing drama or humor, not for the subtextual conclusions that could be drawn from a broader understanding of how people relate. Hard science fits nicely into pre-sized boxes. Questions can be succinct, answers too. But there is less tolerance for people really trying to understand their existences and their personal worlds. I've seen many on Quora express frustration over the recurrence of such personal questions, but I see them as valid expressions, each as different as a snowflake, of the human condition. As such, I think Quora is moving the same direction as most mass media, towards sound bites, and quick satisfaction. In my view, the arts (and empathy) will suffer. I take no joy in penning my bummer answer. Sorry!

how do i make friends	how to make friends 	1	"Having been through very deep depression for over a decade in my life l understand how you feel. I didn't think I would ever have friends in my life for years but I learned some things I'd like to share with you as my life is completely different now and people look to me to teach them communication and how to build rapport.There are lots of great answers to your question so I'll try to give you new suggestions.Here's a basic fact...People want to be happy and are attracted to people and activities that make them happier.Notice how true that is in your own life.Being attractive to people (not physically but emotionally) is the key.Here are my suggestions...Become great at asking questions to get people to talk. We all love to talk about ourselves but that's the problem in life, we want to talk not listen. Therefore becoming great at listening by becoming great at asking questions is a valuable skill. A long time ago I learned an acronym that had been super successful at helping me build rapport with strangers to start to meet people to make friends easily. FORM. I use FORM as a structure to ask questions. F stands for family, so sample questions are, are you married, how long for? Do you have kids? O stands for occupation so questions are like, what do you do for a living? How long have you worked there? R stands for recreation, so questions are like, what do you like to do when you're not working, do you have any hobbies? And M stands for money. Questions relating to money can be, are you happy with how much you're making, do you invest in shares or property, which one do you think is best? I can have a conversation with a stranger for an hour with these questions because people love to talk if someone genuinely cares enough to listen. Try this out and you'll be amazed at how easy it is to talk to people.Focus on improving your own level of happiness. Happiness is our natural state of mind that comes about if we don't get caught up in our emotions, feelings and negative thoughts. We're like a cork under water that always wants to float to the surface. It's our dwelling on the past that pulls us down or 'anchors' to negative events in our past that prevent our natural happiness from rising to the surface. Letting go of the negative thoughts as soon as they come into the mind is the key. Becoming conscious of thoughts that turn into feelings that make us feel bad is the beginning of avoiding them. Letting go is an awesome and powerful concept and asking yourself does it really matter with things that bother you helps you to clear the energy of these thoughts and events as they come up.Stop resisting feeling happy and loving. Often we train ourselves to resist feeling happy and loving because we feel we have no right to. It's the complete opposite in fact. We should be happy and loving no matter what because the state of mind we get into determines if we are going to suffer or transcend the situation or not. When we're in a happy or loving state of mind our brains think more positively about solutions. When we're unhappy it perpetuates and we can't solve the problems we are experiencing. Happiness is a state of mind we have to choose dozens or hundreds of times. It's not easy but slowly over time you'll get better by letting go and choosing happiness.Practice making positive comments. Set a goal to pay someone a compliment every day. After achieving the goal practice giving five in a day. Something magical will happen from this. You'll become happier!Learn about yourself. This is the key to happiness. I recommend having your DISC Profile assessment as the principle of the four profiles was identified over two thousand years ago so it's not new and very established. I believe this is the most beneficial subject there is to learn in life! Your ability to be happy has everything to do with how well you understand and get along with people and DISC Profiles provide enormous insight into how to get along with the 75% of people who aren't your DISC Profile.Learn about introverts, extroverts and ambiverts. It helps you to relate and communicate with people who aren't like you.Forgive people. Forgiving people makes you happier because it takes away your feeling you need to judge, punish or condemn people and let the world take care of them with rewards or punishment, which is called karma. Letting people have their own karma frees up the negative energy associated with guilt you think others should feel. And lastly forgive yourself. Often people suffer and struggle in life because of some ""program"" running inside them if guilt or shame so they punish themselves for it and wallow in misery. Letting go of all that crap is the key to happiness.Here's a video intro to DISC Profiles you may enjoy that I made..."

nd she is always sad	aerodynamically what happens when propellor rotates	0	Does she fear your reaction? There’s probably something going on in her life that she would like to share with you, but she is afraid that you won’t understand, that you will judge her or criticize her.She is not looking for you to solve her problems. She is not looking for you to tell her why what she feels does not make sense. She simply wants to share what she thinks and feels, and she wants to know that it’s valid (And it is! Every single feeling, no matter how irrational, is valid.)Talk to her and try to do NOTHING ELSE but understand. Tell her that what she is feeling is completely natural, and that you will always love her and accept her, no matter what, because she is your daughter and a good person.How can you get her to open up? Maybe try giving her a personal experience, a point in your life when you were sad. When you share this, do not judge yourself. Do not tell her that what you were feeling did not make sense. Tell her that it was very hard for you and all you wanted was for someone to share your troubles with who would understand you without judgement. Once she feels safe, she may open up, and when she feels like you’ve heard her and really understand, she may actually ask for your advise!	"A LOT of mathematics is involved.A Propeller Acts Like a WingA propeller is not a screw, but acts like an airfoil or wing generating lift with a forward component giving thrust, but also a transversal angular component from lift and drag requiring torsion of the propeller axis.If you understand how an airfoil or wing works, which is also how a sail works in sailing against the wind, you can understand how a propeller works.The blade of a propeller acts like a wing, which is inclined with a pitch angle to a plane of rotation and with a certain angle of attack aoa to the apparent direction of the incoming flow (relative wind), which depends on the rotational velocity of the propeller and the forward speed. Increasing the rotational velocity with the same pitch, increases the aoa and increasing the forward speed decreases the aoa. A propeller blade acting like a wing gives lift L counted perpendicular to the incoming flow and drag D in the direction of the incoming flow as indicated in the figure below. The component of L in the forward direction (minus a component from drag D) gives thrust. The transversal components of L and D create torsion on the propeller axis which needs to be balanced. The lift/drag ratio L/D is crucial for the performance of the propeller, since L is crucial for thrust and D for turbulent losses. For a symmetric wing L/D = 10-20 for normal aoa = 3-15, with however only L/D = 3 at maximal lift for aoa = 20, as discussed below.Lift and Drag of a WingMechanismBelow we give a shortcut to the action of wing, with the flow seen as perturbation of zero lift/drag potential flow arising from a mechanism of instability at rear separation, which modifies the pressure distribution so as to give both lift and drag. Notice that large lift comes from suction on the leeward surface resulting from the fact the flow does not separate on the crest. This is because the fluid (air or water) has very small viscosity which means that the boundary layer is turbulent with small skin friction closely approximated by the slip boundary condition of potential flow. Viscous flow with laminar boundary layer separates on the crest and gives poor lift.Why a Propeller Gives ThrustA relatively simple method of predicting the performance of a propeller (as well as fans or windmills) is the use of Blade Element Theory. In this method the propeller is divided into a number of independent sections along the length. At each section a force balance is applied involving 2D section lift and drag with the thrust and torque produced the section. At the same time a balance of axial and angular momentum is applied. This produces a set of non-linear equations that can be solved by iteration for each blade section. The resulting values of section thrust and torque can be summed to predict the overall performance of the propeller.Aerodynamics for StudentsJust a couple of years ago they were about to close the doors on the facility that makes the ATR line of turboprop regional airliners. Total orders for the ATR 42 and 72 made by the European consortium had dropped to six, and no new customers were on the horizon. The regional jets (RJs) had won, and the era of the turboprop was over, again.But a funny thing happened on the way to the funeral for the propeller. Oil prices skyrocketed, the financial performance of the world's airlines crashed, and suddenly airlines needed a more efficient and cost-effective way to move passengers over distances of several hundred miles.Now, ATR has nearly 300 orders from airlines all over the world for its highwing turboprop twins and it is doing its best to ramp up production. The same is true in Canada where Bombardier builds its ""Dash"" series of turboprop airliners derived from the de Havilland line. The turboprop is back.For at least 30 years aviation - both airline and business flying - has been announcing the end of..."
what is the bestmost memorable thing you have  ever eaten and why	what is the most delicious dish you have  ever eaten and why	1	The best food I have eaten is a very specific type of Idly called Mallige Idly. By this sentence most Indians will know that I am a south Indian. Anyway, almost a month back, there was a war going on twitter. Gordon Ramsay v/s South Indians. Just because he said our every day food which is Idly and vada looked like prison food for him.. Frankly speaking, it hurt me.. Because I am no prisoner and the food I eat is in fact so healthy that many hospitals serve them on a daily basis to its patients and many doctors recommend this to be consumed on a daily basis as it causes zero affect on health. But, I am least bothered as I know what Idly is made of and how tasty it is and he is the one who is at loss as he will never be able to taste what we taste.Moving on let me describe how this became my favorite food.. As long as i remember, my mom used to make terrible Idlies.. They were full of rava and i hated it (sorry mom). So I could hardly eat idly. But, it was twice a week mandatory breakfast at our place.. we had to eat it as breakfast and then take it to school for lunch.. But, at school i would eat other’s lunch to satisfy my taste buds..I am from Mysore, so the famous festival Dasara gives us a lot of opportunity to have variety of food.. There will be fair and exhibits of lot of stuff which can be bought and also lot of tasty food.. Its called “Mysuru Dasara exhibition”.We used to go there every year as there will be lot of games to play for children (which I wanted to to back then). When I was 9 or 10 years old we were walking in the exhibition, looking around for something exciting to eat with my mom and my brother.. My mom saw that there is a stall of “Mysore Mallige Idly”. So she took us there. She ordered 2 plates of Mallige Idly. One for her and me and one more for my elder brother.. As I used to waste a lot of food back then, she wanted me to taste it first..Maillige idly usually will be served with 2 or 3 types of chutney as shown in the below photo.But, the size and shape of the mallige idly was not like the one in the photo. Just to give you a rough idea.. Have a look at the below picture which shows the thickness of a idly.But, a mallige idly will be 1.5 times thicker that the one in the picture. A lot softer, in fact it will be so soft few people call it sponge idly.. literally it will be like a sponge if to try squeezing it.. but it will not be chewey at all.. it will just melt in the mouth..So, continuing the story. My mom smeared some red chutney and some green chutney and a broken piece of Mallige idly and gave it to me for tasting.. Just for me to decide, if I wanted it or not.. I just put it in my mouth and the flavours of red chilly, ginger, garlic, coconut, coriander, curry leaves, Roasted gram (Hurigadale), with occasional encounter of muster seeds, along with all these the the soft soft mallige idly started bursting in my mouth.. It just melted like butter in my mouth.. I felt like i just visited heaven..I had never tasted anything like that before.. So, i ended up eating 3 or 4 plates of mallige idly that day.. My mom had to call it a day and drag me out of that place..Since then, my mom kept trying and trying to make those idlies. But, till date she hasn’t been successful.. But, the idly of hers has improved a lot.. now i like my mom’s idlies..But, after that, over the period of several years, I have tried Mallige idlies at several places none of them were like the one that i ate that day.. I used to hunt for Mallige idlies in and around mysore but, dint find anything even close to that.. One of my uncle said there is one place near pandavapura (Mandya district) where, in a small house one old man prepares mini idlies which tastes similar to mallige idly.. Immediately I told my dad (he is my partner for all kinds of food exploration, we always keep each other updated on “New good places to eat in Mysore” he is a big time foodie) that we should go there.. so the next day morning we left mysore by 6 am rode on a two wheeler for almost 40 kms (approx) for few plates of Idly.. But, trust me it was worth it.. we enjoyed the journey and the food was amazing (Not a mallige idly. But, fantastic idlies) I would have eaten 3 -4 plates there too..So there it is the best food ever eaten..P.S: I am still searching on the Dasara Exhibitions every year to find that perfect mallige idly. So far I have not been successful.. Anyone knows any place in Bangalore or Mysore which serves awesome mallige idly.. Please let me know.. A hungry soul is waiting to be satisfied.

how difficult is it get into rsi	do you apply for programs like rsi when you are  a rising senior	0	"Former director Cliff Bowman quoted the following statistics for the RSI 2008 selection process:Last year, we had about 940 valid applications (passed the citizenship and year of graduation check, provided enough information that we could evaluate the file).  From this pool, we invited 47 students to the program.  There were an additional 3 DoDEA students and 30 international students selected through other means.In other words, at one point there was a 5% acceptance rate for domestic applicants (though probably lower now).Obviously, the process is not easy, but the acceptance rate only says so much. On one hand, some worthy students don't know to apply to RSI in the first place. On the other hand, most of the students who do are very intense, making the single-digit acceptance rate seem even more grim. In some ways, RSI can be even more selective than admissions at many top colleges, which have a less self-selecting pool of applicants. 47 of the 61 participants of RSI 2009 for which I have college data ended up attending HYPSM (37 HM); most of the ones who did were cross-admitted to at least two or three, and most of the 14 who didn't were international students (some of whom didn't apply to U.S. colleges and universities).I can tell you, though, that the selection process takes into account a huge number of subjective factors, including essays (which are very important) and recommendation letters. Yes, some of the admits are MOPers, IChO medalists, or ISEF Finalists (and later Siemens and STS Finalists), but just as many had relatively minor honors in comparison. The selection committee tries to do a thorough job of taking into account each student's unique background and trying to piece together an assessment of his or her talents and potential.I, for one, had never been invited to any of the Olympiad camps (and most aren't), nor had I even competed in ISEF. Compared to some of the applicants with a huge number of awards or extensive research experience (research experience helps but is a bit overrated), I paled by comparison. However, I brought to the table strong enough grades and test scores to show that I was academically competent (seven 5's on APs, 237 PSAT, 4.0 GPA), a modest track record of extracurriculars (National Science Olympiad medals, Science Bowl, USABO/USAPhO semis), a very strong letter of recommendation from my high school research advisor (who ended up also writing me a college letter of recommendation), and essays into which I had poured my heart and soul. It also certainly helped that I was from the Midwest and that my high school had sent a student to RSI the previous year (and one each two years after me).I should also add that the selection committee chooses at least a couple ""wild cards"" each year who might not be your traditional HYPSM admits. In some cases, as with college admissions, all it takes to get admitted is for something special in your application to stand out to a couple of committee members. There was one student my year who was not as strong by traditional metrics but had experience building robots.The bottom line is that getting into RSI is challenging, but don't be intimidated by the statistics or admit profiles. If RSI is genuinely something that you'd like to do, by all means apply."	RSI: For US applicants, the application deadline is January of your Junior year in high school, and you hear back by March. Not entirely sure what the process looks like for foreign or DOD students, but I’m pretty sure that my roommate at RSI was at least a year older than me (he was from Poland).You should check each program individually; they likely vary on a case-by-case basis, but in general, I would think that for the really top tier prestigious summer camps (RSI, HSHSP, etc.) you apply your junior year and go there junior summer.
who is israil friend	is my boyfriend lying about his true feelings for his friend and is he secretly attracted to her	0	In the 16 month between Sep. 2015 and Dec. 2016 - a period known as the ‘Stabbing Intifada’ - 43 people died from terror attacks and more than 400 were l injured.During this period more than 350 people died from road accidents, 110 were murdered and France alone suffered more than 200 dead and hundreds wounded or crippled.Israel can be volatile, and every incident is amplified in the media tenfold. Under these circumstances, Israel is safer than most countries.	"I was the other woman in a relationship like the one you are describing. I was in a bad place in my own life, a sad place. A guy came along who I found attractive because he was extremely nice to me and had a way of looking at me and speaking to me like I was the most important person in the world. When we first started talking, I didn't know he had a girlfriend. After he and I had started doing some pretty heavy talking, which was about 3 months after we first met, I asked him if he had a girlfriend. He said that yes, he did...a girl who he lived with, who had a grade-school-aged son from a previous relationship. He had been with his girlfriend for over 5 years. I asked him why he didn't tell me about his girlfriend in the beginning, and his answer to me was, ""Because you never asked."" I should have walked away then and there, but by then I was too addicted to the attention he was giving me.  We eventually ended up sleeping together, and we continued to do so for 8 months. He complained about his girlfriend, how she did this wrong and that wrong, how she didn't satisfy him sexually, how her son was a brat, etc. When they moved out of the place they were renting to move into a bigger place (also a rental, and a beautiful, recently built home), he insisted that he was laying the groundwork to get rid of his girlfriend and begin a life with me. Looking back now, I cannot believe how stupid I was. It seemed like every time he opened his mouth, more lies came out, but he was able to convince me that he loved me and that even though things LOOKED one way, they were completely different in actuality...meaning that even though it LOOKED like he and his girlfriend were having a good time, going to fancy parties with their wealthy friends and moving into a gorgeous new home, he was actually miserable and couldn't wait for the day that we could be together. Even though it SEEMED like I was only getting scraps of his time, I was actually the one getting the QUALITY time because he was just so miserable with his girlfriend, the sex was terrible, etc. Oh, did I forget to mention that? He was still having sex with her when he was having sex with me, but told me not to worry about it, because he didn't enjoy the sex with her AT ALL. I know...it was as though I didn't have a brain in my head. I let myself get sucked in, and once he had me, he manipulated me, and I wanted so badly to believe that he loved me that I rationalized everything he did and said. His girlfriend never knew about me. Here was a person who loved him, whose life was being played with. Completely unfair to her, and to say I am ashamed of the role I played in all of it is the understatement of the year. I ended up getting my wish about 8 months after I started sleeping with him. He got rid of his girlfriend and began a relationship with me. Everything seemed to go okay at first, but then a couple of his friends, whose opinions meant everything to him, told him that they liked the other girl much better than they liked me. They also told him that they didn't find me attractive, and after that, he began treating me like crap. I don't think it helped that his friends knew he had been seeing me behind his girlfriend's back. He eventually went back to the other girl, and then they broke up again, and he ended up marrying someone else on a whim about 6 months after that. To be honest, even before his friends told him they didn't care for me, there seemed to be a dark cloud of shame over everything we did after we were able to be a ""real"" couple, meaning after he had broken it off with his girlfriend and we didn't have to sneak around anymore.  I made the mistake of thinking that we were having a real relationship while he was still with his girlfriend and I was the girl on the side. We really weren't having a real relationship when we were sneaking around behind his girlfriend's back. You can't ever have a real relationship with someone who is unavailable.  I was completely crushed by the entire experience. I deserved everything I got, and more...and believe me when I tell you that it took a very, very long time...years...for my life to get back to normal. I will say again that I deserved everything that happened to me as a result of my involvement with him. I am sure it was a combination of low self esteem and my vulnerable state due to all of the unpleasant things that were happening in my own life, that caused me to get sucked in by a person like him.This man also had a history of staying with a woman for 5 years, then cheating on her and finding someone else, and then staying with the new woman for 5 years. I was so blind and so hooked on the way he made me feel that I believed him when he said he was sure that this time (meaning with me) would be different. Well, it was actually different, but that was because my involvement with him lasted for only a year, as opposed to his usual 5 years with other women. Why I thought I was any different or more special than any of the other women is beyond me...but I will make a guess and say that it probably had something to do with the many, many lies he was telling me to keep me around, to serve his purpose of having his cake and eating it too. So many red flags, and I just couldn't, or perhaps wouldn't, see them. Oh, and I should add that I never used to think much about track records...I was just so optimistic, I guess, that I figured that just because something didn't work five times, the sixth time it just might work out. Very foolish thinking. I now pay close attention to track records.I almost forgot to add that during our not real relationship, after he had moved into the new, beautiful house with his girlfriend, I must have somewhat regained part of my sanity, because I told him that maybe we should stop contacting each other for a while so that he could explore his relationship with his girlfriend, and see if maybe he still loved her down deep. His response was an immediate, ""No. I don't want to stop talking with you."" So, like the willfully blind idiot that I had become, I continued seeing him. I have already written a lot here, and there are many twists and turns to the story, so in the interest of keeping it a little shorter, I won't go into more detail...but I want you to believe me when I say that my involvement with this man nearly ruined my life.  Please walk away from this man you are involved with. He does not sound like an honorable man at all. I am telling you from experience that when you begin a relationship based on dishonesty, you will have more problems than you can count, and karma has a way of catching up with you."

how is the new harry potter book harry potter and the cursed child	how bad is the new book by jk rowling	1	Oh gosh, NO.Aside, from the fact that the “book” itself was more of a play manuscript than an actual novel, which made reading harder to digest, there were so many uses bad of storytelling, character inconsistencies and themes which honestly made the book a headache to read.Now, before I tear this book to shreds, there were some good things that I’d like to say about Harry Potter and The Cursed Child.SPOILERs but hey this book’s not worth reading yet anyway.Good Things:Up until they introduced the time-travelling plot device, I thought the storyline was actually going smoothly. I liked how they introduced Harry Potter’s kid, Albus Severus, as this student who’s constantly living under his father’s shadow and that unlike Harry, he’s never had any fun or memorable adventures before the inciting incident, thus he’s always looked down upon by everyone else for not living up to his father’s guise.The fact that he was placed in Slytherin instead of Gryffindor would have really made for some really good conflict. I actually liked the fact that he was placed in Slytherin instead of Gryffindor. It would have been interesting to see the majority of the kids in Gryffindor as the antagonists of the story, something fresh and new and a complete role reversal from the previous books. We’d be able to see that not all the kids in Slytherin are mean, evil bullies but can actually be decent people. But sadly, this theme was not fully explored.Bad thingsMaking Harry Potter into this asshole character. I understand characters develop over time but I thought this version of Harry deviated too much from the one in the previous books. In the previous books, Harry was this brave, selfless yet impulsive guy who’s willing to risk his life to save his friends. In this book, he asks Albus to sever his friendship to Scorpius, one of the few friends he has in Hogwarts, and he even yelled at him saying that he wish he didn’t have a son like him. I thought Harry was a little too unlikeable and someone who’s far different than what he was in the books.Hermione’s dark future. There was this alternate timeline in which Hermione became this bitter, angry Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher after she lost Ron and that’s not what Hermione is like! She’s logical, smart, calm and not the kind of character who would have let her future and actions be defined by a guy. Its basically saying Hermione is dependent on Ron for her happiness and Hermione is too strong and independent of a character who would let a guy dictate her choices.Bellatrix and Voldemort. In the previous books, Voldemort has been established as this cold, calculating villain who doesn’t care about anyone but himself. The fact that he did it with Bellatrix is about as plausible as discovering a sugar cube on Mars, it doesn’t fit with his character at all. It just made for a bunch of character inconsistencies and derailed his personality. It’s like the author was playing a game of darts and decided to randomly assign a “shocking” event just to make another useless plot twist.The Whole time-travelling plot. Time-travelling is one of the trickier plot devices to put in any medium, wether it be a book or a movie. In my opinion, a story should not revolve around time-travelling, as it’s a device best used for a one-off story element. Time travelling worked in Prisoner of Azkaban as it’s not focused throughout the whole book, since the story relied on elements of mystery to make the story flow. Questions like: Who is Sirius Black? How did Voldemort find Harry’s parents? Who is Peter Pettigrew? These questions keep the reader interested and push the story through. I don’t think Cursed Child has any of those elements and it’s just a bad Harry Potter fan fic of these kids moving to fan fic A, then going to fan fic B and then going to fan fic C.Wasted Potential.

why do i always get depressed	why do i always get depressed in the evening	0	Is there a thought process or belief system attached to the depression? What I mean is, are there circumstances that you think about and become depressed, or do you have a negative self-image, or feel some external force is somehow making your life hard? In my case, I have a very good life - great marriage, great job, etc., but couldn't seem to enjoy my life. I felt either sad, irritable or numb all the time. I sought help because it seemed more chemical than psychological or circumstantial. I was diagnosed with bipolar II. If it's more situational for you, or you feel you somehow deserve what you are feeling, I encourage you to seek a therapist or psychologist to find the root cause and learn techniques to cope. I do both - take the medication to balance out the bipolar disorder and see a therapist when I'm struggling with something that I need more than advice from loved ones about.	Humans react to darkness in much the same way. Some to even a greater extent like you, it could be what darkness represents that triggers your depression. Dark is the opposite of bright or positive. Depressed people often dress in dark gloomy colors indicative of their mood. Though you are opposed to uv light therapy the more light you leave on in the house the better. There is a seasonal affective component to depression that is not just light related, it's dark related. Plus the weather prevents a lot of activity which may help with depression. Depression in the evening should react to the same treatment for depression in general. Look into cognitive therapies by Albert Ellis for treatments,

can we ever store energy produced in lightning	is it possible to store the energy of lightning	1	Benjamin Franklin hypothesized that lightning is an electrical phenomenon, and that the electrical effect of lightning might be transferable to another object and cause an effect that could be recognized as electricity. He did a famous Kite experiment to prove this hypothesis.In 1752 in Philadelphia Ben Franklin decided did this experiment. With the help of his son, William, he attached his kite to a silk string, tying an iron key at the other end. Next, they tied a thin metal wire from the key and inserted the wire into a leyden Jar , a container for storing an electrical charge. Leyden Jar is shown belowFinally, as the sky darkened and a thunderstorm approached, they attached a silk ribbon to the key. Holding onto the kite by the silk ribbon, Ben flew the kite and once it was aloft, he retreated into a barn so that he would not get wet. The thunder storm cloud passed over Franklin's kite, whereupon the negative charges in the cloud passed onto his kite, down the wet silk string, to the key, and into the jar. Ben however, was unaffected by the negative charges because he was holding the dry silk ribbon, insulating him from the charges on the key. When he moved his free hand near the iron key, he received a shock. Why? Because the negative charges in the key were so strongly attracted to the positive charges in his body, a spark jumped from the key to his hand. Franklin's experiment successfully showed that lightning was static electricity. One can experience this same reaction while rubbing feet on a carpet and then touching the metal doorknob.Ben was lucky to survived this dangerous experiment as many who performed this same kite experiment were electrocuted.This was one of experiment that was done to display the electrical energy stored in lightening. I am hopeful that the day will come when lightening will be harnessed for generating electrical energy to meet our energy needsSource of content and pictures : internet and Google images	Benjamin Franklin hypothesized that lightning is an electrical phenomenon, and that the electrical effect of lightning might be transferable to another object and cause an effect that could be recognized as electricity.

what is your review of performance testing	what is performance testing	0	★★★★★A2AI am assuming that you are new to performance testing (PT) and need to know how it is to work as a performance tester. I may stray into Performance Engineering (PE) while answering which is the superset of PT involving root-cause analysis and fixing the issues. I am not an authority and whatever I am answering is based upon a little experience I happen to have. Here are the different viewpoints:Career Prospects: Let me be very Frank – there are not a lot of companies who would want their product to go through performance evaluation, there are several reasons for it.Number one reason is the lack of vision. Many managers or even the product owners do not have the vision of how a performance evaluation may help them in future. They are just eager to push the damn thing to production where it can start serving rather than having a product with good all-around quality.The application has too few users.Deciding against PT due to the high cost it carries mainly because of expensive tools and workforce.Having said that and going by the rules of the nature, as the demand is less the supply is also low. You would see very few people opting it as this is a specialized service.Even the companies like TCS, Infosys etc. which have a workforce running into hundred thousands have just a few hundred performance testers.‘Good’ performance testers are even fewer. What makes you a good performance tester?The qualities are, but not limited to the following:To be able to ‘size’ the load. It’s a huge topic whose details can be found via any search engineTo be able to ‘script’ using a wide range of tools including commercial tools as well as open source.Expert on various operating systems like Windows, Red Hat etc.Knows shell scriptingTo be able to analyze the results and identify the problemTo be able to find the root cause of the problem which is called the bottle neckGood in SQL, knows the architecture and how DBMS works at grass root level.Excellent is networking conceptsQuick learnerHas an eye for detailExcellent communicator Learning CurveAs evident from the list of skills you need – the learning curve is a little steep. It’s not something you learn quickly. Some of the things need training while majority of things can only be learnt by experience. I cannot stress enough on the number of tools you are expected to have ‘expertise’ on. New things are introduced all the time and you have to keep yourself updated all the time. This holds true for almost all IT related skills. Work-Life BalanceYour usual day will be as it is for others in the software industry, especially in India, which means having little to no social life in the weekdays. The only silver lining is that your work will never get monotonous.Most clients would not want you to choke their resources in usual business hours so be prepared for off-hours execution.Usually senior testers are required to travel a lot. What Next?You could start from learning a tool of your choice as people consider that as an entry criteria to get into PT. Later on – you could look to acquire more skills and eventually graduate to a more advance level of PE. There are ample opportunities around the world. A lot of people also get into freelance or consulting roles. Things to RememberOnly get into PT if it is something you really want to do. No because you ‘can’ do or ‘should’ do.Once you decide to get into it, give it everything. It needs a lot of hard work to perfect – like every other skill but even the skills required to ‘just get the work done’ are not easy to acquire.Few people would underestimate your work saying “record aur play hi karna hai ji” (you just need to record and play) whereas recording and playing takes just 10 to 15% of the effort.

what are the types of immunity	what are the different types of immunity in our body	0	Immunity is a condition of being able to resist a particular disease especially through preventing development of pathogenic microorganism or by counteracting the effects of its products. It is the capability of the body to resist harmful microorganisms or viruses from entering it. The healthy immune process is capable to recognize invading viruses, bacteria and also produce antibodies to destroy or disable them. It is the ability of the body to restrict dangerous microorganisms or viruses from entering it. For more you may follow Immunity | Definition and Types of Immunity	"Not a silly question at all, especially if we bypass the ""eat"" part and ask why just, say, injecting a fish cell into our arm wouldn't turn us into a fish, or why giving our kid a transfusion of mongoose blood wouldn't turn him into a speedy superpowered whizzer.There are two parts to the answer.  First, DNA needs to have an elaborate support system before it can do anything.  It needs to be in a nucleus, wrapped in histones and other proteins, with access to polymerases and other enzymes, and so on and so on.  Just shoving DNA into your bloodstream doesn't give it access to those things, so it can't take over your cells to make fish or mongoose type proteins.(But if you add to the DNA a system for entering a new cell and taking over the built-in systems, then you have a virus, which essentially does exactly that -- turns your cells into a system for making more viruses.)But why not a whole cell? Why can't a fish cell settle down comfortably into our body and just pump out fish proteins all day long?The answer is the immune system, which is aimed at identifying things that are not ""self"" -- that is, that don't match the template of our own cells -- and to attack and reject them.  The immune system is very good at that, and can even reject very similar cells, like those of a different human, so identifying a fish or a mongoose cell is very easy to do, and those cells would be very quickly attacked and destroyed.(Today, the immune system is tuned for identifying and destroying bacteria and viruses and so on.  But it's possible that hundreds of millions of years ago, much of the immune system was tuned for exactly what we're talking about here -- preventing foreign cells from moving into the friendly environment and taking over.)"
what is a narcissistic personality disorder	what is narcissistic personality disorder	1	"There are different things to look for depending on how the narcissist views you. The easiest one is if you are a potential romantic partner. Look for idealization and for the narcissist to try and match your interests or personality. You might also be on the sidelines and seeing the narcissist idealizing someone as a third party.""OH he's just perfect!!!"" ""Oh look how sweet he is. OMG he works so hard"".If you are the romantic interest, things like ""I feel soo strongly about everything you just said."" ""Wow you are so amazing you must work so hard to be so smart"" ""you must be so brave to do X. Everybody loves you!"" ""you must bla bla bla.""The narcissist won't even realize they are doing this. They've lacked honest love in childhood and so they just walk around mimicking it in adult hood. To them, they really are in love after just 3 conversations. For the partner, this can feel amazing, until the relationship starts to actually develop and the partner realizes the narcissist has no idea of how to really give love (compliments and puppy dog eyes are not love after all). At this point it can never be the narcissist's fault that a relationship doesn't work. It must be the partners fault and they become devalued. Out goes the idealization and the partner becomes an object to the narcissist. They will use them until they don't need them anymore. This is the area where most relationships with narcissists exist.Narcissist aren't satisfied with your love, but they want your attention. Once they have it, their mindset shifts into""IS THIS LOVE GOOD ENOUGH FOR ME? THERE IS PROBABLY BETTER LOVE SOMEWHERE AND I WANT IT.""Or,""What does everyone think about me for loving this person? Are they judging me? Am I missing out being more admired for not having a more attractive/ambitious/hard working/ wealthy/good hearted/ partner?""They will secretly start resenting you. They will secretly start being ashamed of you. They will secretly start logging things that they believe are bad about you. However they can't tell you this, because then they'll lose your attention. But the resentment eventually comes out in mistreatment and abuse. The partner might then pull away and the narcissists will repeat the cycle of charming and devaluing. In the meantime, people outside the relationship are being told that the narcissist isn't really interested in the relationship, they are only doing it because '[insert immature reason here]'. Knowing this, here are the things you can look for before being a victim.Look for:Idealizationlots of short lived relationshipslots of blaming partners in past relationships for the failurelots of acquaintances but no close friends(intimacy is very hard for narcissists. They will feign intimacy with their friends but they don't really have it.)an extreme concern for their image- physical, social or both.an extreme concern for either not being judged or being judged highly.This will either come off as shyness or confidence. A confident narcissist always has to be in the spotlight if it's a chance for them to gain admiration. A SHY narcissist is preoccupied with avoiding the spotlight, particularly if it might end up in praise, because they fear judgement and jealousy. Narcissists are generally very envious and jealous of other peoples successes. As such, they believe others will be jealous and envious of them. This freaks out a shy narcissist because a shy narcissist wants to be loved by everyone.Narcissist target people to develop relationships with as opposed to letting relationships develop through natural interactions.A narcissist will say ""that person will be a good boyfriend/friend. I want their attention, resources, focus."" Then they'll figure out how to make it happen by pretending to be someone that person would need or want. An excellent example I read, probably here on QUORA, was the Jr. High/High School crush scenarios most of us experienced in our youth. We liked somebody so we pretended to be into their favorite band, or like their favorite food, or into musical theater because it allowed us to get their attention. Obviously these interactions are of very little value because they are disingenuous. A narcissist ONLY interacts this way with people. Because they've been doing it forever they become very good at it. It becomes very hard to recognize the dishonesty in their act. The narcissist themselves might not even recognize it's an act. They might be doing it out of habit, they might not know there are other ways of being.Splitting and devaluingThere is no grey with narcissists. Grey counts as black. EVERYONE is grey so once relationships develop beyond simple friendships people quickly become devalued. This is when the narcissist ""realizes"" the person they fell in love or developed a friendship with is not actually a worthy person. There is something wrong with them. At this point the relationship quickly shifts to one of resource acquisition. The narcissist will now use the friend or partner for narcissistic supply and resources. Once the other person loses their use, the narcissist discards them like an old appliance. In the mean time a lot of manipulation is occurring to keep the resource supply available. If you are a partner they will continue to play the role of ""you are so wonderful. I love you"" but with a lot less inspiration. Or they will say things like ""I would love you more if you just did this right, that right, this right"" etc... There is always something the partner is doing wrong. This comes from the mentality mentioned above. The narcissists behavior will no longer match the feelings they claim to have. This becomes very hard for the partner. If the partner tries to distance themselves the narcissist comes back in full force with claims of love. Eventually however, they will abandon them. They will just wait it out for when they no longer need them. If they discard something, i mean someone, and then realize they need it again they will come back to the old appliance to get more use out of it. People are objects to a narcissist. They live in a world where only one person exists. Themselves.RageWhen a narcissist isn't raging they are abusing subtly. It is subtle enough that people on the receiving-end are confused about it. They know they don't feel good but it's hard for them to pinpoint why. But when a narcissist experiences an event that challenges a channel they receive narcissistic supply from, that abuse becomes acute and intensified. When these channels are compromised or removed, the need to fix the channel completely overtakes the narcs psyche. The narc will do two things: make it their number 1 priority to punish the offender or do everything they can to bring the offender back into their camp. Things here can get really intense, and unfortunately, it's not until a person is at the receiving end of narcissistic rage that they wake up to who they are dealing with. Expect emotional extremes from suicide to murder during a narcissistic rage episode. Everything in between is possible, crying, hitting, threats, screaming, breaking things, stalking, pleas of love, desperate requests for forgiveness. The narcs false-reality is compromised and they'll do everything they can to keep the truth from slipping in. The need to keep the truth out is intense and it's at the core of why NPD's rarely admit faults or seek therapy.History of family mental illnessThere is a lot of evidence cluster A and B personality disorders are genetic. If another family member has been diagnosed with more easily diagnosable disorders like schizophrenia, schizotypical, or avoidant personality disorders, the likelihood of someone having a cluster A or B disorder increases. If the parents have issues then it is extremely likey they've developed a disorder simply because the parents have been socializing them to manipulate and view the world through a distrustful and fearful lens.I've tried to keep these traits ubiquitous to the two main types of narcissism. There is overt/arrogant narcissism (think steve jobs and dick cheney) and then there is covert/shy narcissism (think of the sweet innocent girl who is reserved and quiet). They each have their own traits but the fundamentals are the same. They have lacked love and connection with other human beings throughout childhood and are now out to acquire something like love to make up for it in adulthood. The lack of love has instilled a sense of worthlessness and insecurity. As a defense to this low self esteem they develop delusions of grandiosity. Shy narcissist use this defense but they deal with the delusions a bit differently. You can look up covert narcissism and overt narcissism for unique traits to each disorder."	"They are few but they exist..and its sheer bad luck if you meet someone with NPD for friendship, work or relationship...Initially he will be extremely charming, you fall for his witty attitude, intelligence, appearance, sexiness, grand clothing, powerful English talks..he will call you often, keep texting you..and there you fall in the trap..Then he tries to become your friend..you start hanging out, watch movies, eat lunch together..but always you need to pay, he is very stingy even though he would earn much more than you..but you never mind as you are deeply in love with this person, feel connected like soul mates so you keep ignoring all warning signsAppearance -he is preoccupied with his looks, hair, clothes and constantly seeks attention and needs compliments and you keep giving them as you are in love..He is usually a meterosexual man who does his eyebrows, waxes his hands and legs (how gayish) wears trendy loud clothes with a sense of extreme pride..goes to expensive spas and salons more often than ladies..wears only branded apparel and mocks people who live simple life.. (you find it odd but again ignore as you are in love, rembr? )and you will never ever get a compliment on anything new you do..you celebrate his birthday in the best possible way showering him with gifts, time, and attention but when your birthday comes, he ""forgets"" it..or if reminded will send you a text may be...but shockingly no celebration or gift to appreciate you..thats his best way if telling - I dont care..you do not exist for me...he runs hot and cold...meaning 3 phasesIdealisationDevaluationDiscardDiscard is the most painful phase as it comes out of the blue, when you have never imagined it..he stops talking to you, gives silent treatment for no reason..when you ask what is wrong..he bluntly says - all is good, why do you feel so? and then he completely disconnects..its very confusing for the victim as she is left alone to pick the pieces..she feels the demise of a person who never existed..it was all an illusion..the person's mask has fallen..she mourns..she grieves..if she is strong she bounces back..but it takes time and efforts as only she is there to support herself..there is no closure...only sudden discard like garbage..and all above is true for NPD friend too..basically they are FAKE, EMPTY souls..they lack basic human traits of empathy and compassion..they can never FEEL any emotion..so they cant feel your love, care..they dont have any close friends only fake friendships..so beware of such creatures and protect yourself..May God protect all.."
how i can speak english fluently	how can i learn to speak english fluently	1	Your question consists of two parts:one is how to speak confidently and another is how to speak fluently.Let me make it short for you.First of all confident comes when you feel that you are perfect in speaking English and that feeling will not come overnight.simple answer is that you need to work hard.This working hard nature develops only if you are in very high need of English.I mean it is not as easy as asking question in quora.Here I suggest you that don’t simply say I want to learn English,instead do something for accomplishing it.The following are the things that you should do to speak confidently:Initially,start speaking in English with your inner conscience.You will never succeed if you don’t take any bold step.Believe me completely.You are going to win over this challenge if you start immediately.I saw many people who take many suggestions but never implement when time arrives.I request you to follow strictly.Now the second thing is use the IELTS application which enables you to speak with strangers.NOTE:Speak only with a motto to develop English in that very app.Don’t waste time in speaking unnecessary things with those who speak dirty words.Just hang up if you come across them.SUGGESTION:Don’t expect results immediately.Go on following things for a period of time. On one particular day you will find the results.For some it may take 5 months;for some it may be 1 year. It all depends on how often you practice it.Finally,your confidence levels depends on how much you practices daily either speaking with inner conscience or in IELTS.You know,indirectly speaking English confidently and fluently depends even on how much you suffer daily,because of lack of speaking English skills.This is because every time you suffer, your wish for speaking English increase gradually.Try to create strong necessity for learning English.Coming to next part of question how to speak fluently?Many people fail to speak fluently because of lack of words.Yes,it is because of lack of words.Let me break the phrase.Lack of words means people don’t have exact words to be used at that instance.People fail to express their views because of the same reason.Let me put forward few more tips to be followed:You need to have lots of words in your mind in order to express your views freely.All you need to do is to watch a lot of English movies with subtitles initially,read English News Papers daily and the most importantly inculcate the habit of thinking in English.Do every possible thing to improve your vocabulary as it helps you to use exact words in times of need with out saying aaaaa for longer period while speaking..Last and final thing is that imitate the accent of the speakers who speaks fluently.This will helps you in the course of time to speak fluently.I think this would help you.Please follow the suggestions without any delay.Thank you.Best of Luck!

Described in an old New Yorker article as “tall and lanky, with very long brown hair and a brown goatee; his admirers call him Jesus.” Abridged version follows (and if the abridged version is too long; bold text tells the story):Ferguson was born in Los Angeles in 1963. His mother, Beatriz, was a mathematician and his father, Tom, taught game theory at U.C.L.A. Tom Ferguson brought home specialized board games and card games and taught them to Chris and his older brother, Marc, who is now a computer programmer. “Whenever there was a rainy day, we would get to stay inside and play Risk,” Tom Ferguson told me. His younger son “learned to think about playing and strategies and what other people know about what you know. It’s not important in chess, but it’s important in poker. It’s a rather deep game, when you get involved.”…At seventeen, accompanied by some of them, he began making occasional trips to Las Vegas. He and his friends would pool gas money, sleep in cheap hotels, and eat at the buffets. He liked Vegas because the people in the casinos called him “sir,” and “you could lean back in your chair and no one would yell at you, unlike school.” His friends went for fun, but Ferguson went to establish whether he played poker well. “I saw Vegas as a challenge,” he told me. “Play ten hours a day, pay for my room and my food, and get home with more money than I started with. I think of that as my transition into manhood—when I was able to prove to myself that if I had no support from my family, and no job, as long as I could get to Vegas, and have a hundred dollars in my pocket, I could survive.”…As an undergraduate, at U.C.L.A., Ferguson thought that joining the swing-dance club would be a good way to meet people, and now he is an expert dancer. He met his girlfriend, a Brazilian woman named Fabiola Gomes, at a night club. Gomes, a personal trainer, is petite and animated, with thick ringlets of dark hair. They live in her house in Las Vegas. Until two years ago, Ferguson, who is forty-five, lived mostly with his parents.…His thesis adviser was Leonard Kleinrock, whose lab sent what was considered the first message over the Internet, in 1969. Kleinrock told me that Ferguson was “one of the more brilliant and creative young men that I’ve known in my career at U.C.L.A.” During the late eighties, Ferguson was working as a programmer for a more advanced doctoral candidate when the student got a result he couldn’t interpret. “Chris, this lowly programmer, writing code, explained what was causing the result,” Kleinrock said. “It was a very deep theoretical idea, and his manner was very low-key, no bravado, just pure intelligence, and, when I saw that, I thought, I want to follow through with this guy.”…Ferguson moved out of his parents’ house in California when he became really rich. (Nevada has no income tax.) He has won more than seven million dollars playing poker, and that’s still less, apparently, than what he has earned as “something like chairman of the board” of Tiltware, which developed and licensed the software for Supergame, where people play poker, sometimes against Ferguson and other professionals, for money. In 2002, dissatisfied with the customer service of the online poker sites he visited, he saw the opportunity for a site “for the player, by the player, and of the player,” and began writing software for it. Supergame began operations two years later. Ferguson and a dozen other pro players involved with the site are known as Team Full Tilt.Initially, Full Tilt represented a novelty—other sites had pro players affiliated with them, but usually only one or two, and they weren’t necessarily available to play hands with customers. “It grew about three per cent a week for the first year, and two per cent a week for the two years after, and suddenly you realize you’re there,” Ferguson said. According to H2 Gambling Capital, a gaming consultancy, the online poker business made $3.8 billion last year. The largest site is Play Poker Games at PokerStars, which is based on the Isle of Man. Supergame is the second largest, and one of the fastest growing. It has a sister site, Play online poker at Full Tilt, where only play money is used. Being rich, Ferguson said, makes his attention less acute, but his judgment more reliable. “Your judgment can be skewed if you’re desperate,” he said.As for the second part of your question, it appears to require brilliance and luck in massive doses. But I only have one story to go off of…Full article: What Would Jesus Bet? - The New Yorker (A lot of great detail not posted above.)Photograph by Martin Schoeller (taken from article).

if i fire a bullet backward from an aircraft going faster than the bullet will the bullet be going backwards	do bullets travel faster than the speed of sound when shot from a gun if not is it possible if they do what gun and how much devastation occurs	0	I’m reminded of the tree/hunter/squirrel problem:Q: A hunter goes around a tree looking for a squirrel. The squirrel stays on the far side of the tree so that the hunter never sees her, and her belly is always toward the hunter. When the hunter has gone around the tree, has she also gone around the squirrel?A: It depends on what you mean by “around.” (Answer provided by Richard Feynman.)The answer to your question depends on what you mean by “backwards.”Let’s have some numbers:The plane is flying north at ten miles an hour.The muzzle velocity is one mile an hour.The air is still (no wind).So, relative to the plane, the bullet is flying backwards at one mile an hour.Relative to the earth, the bullet is flying north at nine miles an hour.Aerodynamically speaking, the bullet is flying backwards because, until it starts to tumble, it passes thru the air butt first.Relative to the gun, the bullet goes forwards out the barrel and away from the gun in the normal way (normal except that air resistance speeds it up rather than slows it down.)	I guess this answer may be incorrect. I had always thought it was correct, but it seems that many guns do not Fire bullets at the speed of sound. It also appears that the sound may be more from the propellant igniting. Most guns fire bullets faster than the speed of sound. This is the reason for the sound of a gunshot. The sound of a gunshot is mostly from the sonic boom created by the bullet. Many things in daily life create a sonic boom. A whip or even a towel snapping creates a sonic boom. If you have a dish of black powder and you ignite it, there is no sonic boom. So the explosion that fires the gun does not make the sound of a gunshot. It is the bullet reaching the speed of sound that does this. Pellet guns or BB guns do not Fire pellets or BBs faster than the speed of sound. Almost all other guns do though.
how do i prevent breast cancer	is breast cancer preventable	0	Breast cancer is a preventable cancer. Research and studies highlight that there are many modifiable and non-modifiable causes of Breast Cancer. This cancer is the most common type affecting urban women and is fast approaching the rural population. If you lead a stressful life or have any family history of breast cancer, it is important that you embrace and implement preventive points for breast cancer:Opt for diet that fights Cancer –Diet and Exercise have been highlighted as two of the most important aspects that can prevent cancer. Healthy diet habits reduce risk of cancer breast in women. Inclusion of food of plant origin includes broccoli, berries and garlic containing phytochemicals seems to protect cell from harmful effects. Antioxidants- vitamin C, found in citrus fruits, orange juice, leafy greens, beans and fortified breakfast cereals boosts the body immunity and prevent breast cancer.Exercise to keep the cancer cells at bay –Regular exercise, 30-minute brisk walks helps to keep your weight in check. It can also lower estrogen levels and boost the immune system, helping to prevent any abnormal cells from growing and spreading. Studies have highlighted that women doing brisk walking and minimal exercise alters estrogen metabolism and reduces risk of cancer by 18% compared to women leading a sedentary life style.Always opt for Self Breast Examination –Most important is to know about your own breasts. Women with dense breasts have an increased risk of developing breast cancer by 6 times. Self breast examination is the main tool to pickup early changes. It is also the best way to detect any abnormality in the breast like any discharge from nipples and crusting or redness of nipples.Design your food plate with consideration –Eating less of animal products and choosing organic food items decreases the breast cancer risk. Even one alcoholic drink per day could raise your breast cancer risk.Keep a check on your drinking and smoking –Drinking regularly and having two or three glasses of wine or cocktails at once can increase your risk of breast cancer immediately to 20%.Habits of Alcohol and smoking are associated with cancer breast.Chose your cosmetics wisely-Women are using cosmetics containing Parabens is carcinogen, widely used as preservative in deodorant, lipsticks, toothpaste and shampoo. Glycol is one of the most widely used in ingredients in cosmetics and also found in paints, and dyes are proven in risk of cancer of breast. Women should avoid such products.Don’t shy away from the sun –Most of women avoid sunlight. It is the richest source of Vitamin D- promotes bone growth and bone healing. It is also an alternative to estrogen-lowering drugs to reduce breast cancer risk.Hormone Replacement increases your breast cancer risk-Women on Hormone replacement therapy have an increased risk of developing breast cancer by 30%. Hence limited use of HRT is recommended. Minimizing radiation exposure from screening in women treated for Hodgkin’s lymphoma, tuberculosis repeated X-Rays should be avoided.Stress is your biggest enemy –Women managing home and offices suffering from both stress and lack of sleep are most common culprit causeing many diseases and health issues. In fact stress causes lack of sleep, obesity, blood sugar and increases estrogen production. It is also the leading factor causing breast cancer.	Breast cancer is a preventable cancer.

what is purpose of life	what  the purpose of life what is life actually about	1	Well, I am 19, but I still feel I have figured out the answer to this question which I am going to share with you.First of all, speaking in a very discrete fashion, life makes no sense. We all will die one day (god forbid it, maybe this very moment) and would be just like before - nothing. It won’t matter if you lived the life of Elon Musk or some random dude (admitted, Elon has lots of problems of his own, but his life is idolised by the masses unlike yours and mine). So why make an effort for anything?Everyone among us does a variety of jobs/emotions everyday which you can classify as ‘I enjoy it’ (eating, sleeping, partying, watching movies, etc.) and ‘I hate doing it’ (studying for many, working, waking up to go to office, deadlines, accidental pains, loneliness, breakups, etc.).The quality of your life is determined by the sum total of above. Is the total number of things which you love doing more than those you hate? For most people this is not the case. They are too busy making both ends meet and making a secure future for themselves and their progeny. This is what makes them question their life. It is these people who feel life has no purpose mostly.So, were you better off if you weren’t created in the first place? Or you are better spending 80 years in the form of life where you would have to go through all these good and bad feelings and circumstances? This makes me wonder if life has no purpose at all. I mean, you are born, go through an education system for 20+ years (to fit in), and then do a job (and face lots of difficulties and failures in life), do the same with your kids, and eventually die. This makes me wonder if all this was a waste. But then, we get to experience so many good stuff in this journey (success, joy, travelling, knowledge, food, music, nature, etc.)So does life have a purpose?Depends on you. If you want to enjoy this beautiful gift and experience as many things as possible, do it now. Don’t wait for anything. You never know when you will die. You don’t want to regret not asking out that girl/ going for a trek/ learning the guitar/ completing your PhD in your afterlife (if it exists).If you are someone who is facing a lot of drudgery and all sorts of tragedies (true for most people at least in India and similar developing and underdeveloped nations. Believe it or not, poverty leads to lots of problems which leads to questioning the purpose of life.), then better try to find happiness in whatever you have, because a life without good things is worthless and a pain in the @$$. The quality of your life is more about your perception of it than what the society makes you believe. Even a person with no education, money or love can live happily. So why make it so bad? Enjoy it while you have it.The purpose of life - To live it in such a way that you don’t ask yourself this question when you die.

what is the right etiquette for wishing a jehovah witness happy birthday	how important is it to be the first person to wish someone a happy birthday	0	Before we celebrate or NOT celebrate, let’s ask ourselves “What is a birthday”. I mean; who started birthdays doesn’t mean I should do it the way he did it. Who started making a particular dish doesn’t determine the way I would like to cook that same dish. Hope I’m making sense. All clothes have a common origin (whatever it is) but both ‘sinners’ and christians wear it.So what is a birthday. Basically, no matter how you celebrate it a birthday is a celebration acknowledging a person’s birth. That is basically what it is, whether you would like to wage war on it, do charity on it, DIE on it, behead John the Baptist on it, get drunk on it, stay in CHURCH ALL DAY on it, engage in a thanksgiving on it, do suicide bombing on it. THAT’S BASICALLY WHAT IT IS: a celebration acknowledging a person’s birth.Now, if I am a Christian and I decide to wake up one day and I say “Dear Lord, thank you, for 15 years ago on a day like this, I was born and you have preserved my life even up till now. Many women died on that very day, some with their babies trying to be born, some leaving their babies in this wicked world, some babies were born that day, but could not see today, but I am here healthy and hearty and I want to appreciate your Holy Name for adding another 365 days in which your eyes were never off me. In Jesus’ name amen.” And if on that same day, some other Christians who see me are also happy IN THE SAME LIGHT for me, and say “The Lord preserve your life” or “The Lord add more years to you”. Please, can I ask those who call themselves JEHOVAH’S WITNESSES,WHAT IS WRONG WITH THAT!!!!!!!!!!!!What is wrong with waking up on your Birthday and APPRECIATING JEHOVAH GOD, The one God who owns life and death and has been faithful enough to add three hundred and sixty five solid days to your life unfailingly with a THANKSGIVING SERVICE.I grew up in a Christian home, and what I know a birthday to be goes like this:We gather, we sing songs of praise to God, We pray for the celebrant, We cut a big beautiful cake and sing “Happy Birthday to you x2, How old are you now x2, May God bless you now x2”., and then we eat, drink and close for the day.WHAT IS WRONG WITH THAT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!If a birthday is described as “A service where we APPRECIATE GOD for adding 365 solid days of life to a person” then please JEHOVAH’S WITNESSES , What is wrong with that?In fact, what IS wrong is not doing it for the SON OF GOD. You celebrate his death but does someone DIE when he is NOT BORN.If Christmas is defined as a time when we APPRECIATE GOD for the day his only begotten Son Jesus Christ came into the world then pleaseWHAT IS WRONG WITH THAT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!In conclusion, as a Christian not celebrating birthdays or Christmas makes you an ingrate of the highest order. One who is not appreciative of the FREE gift of life given by JEHOVAH GOD.	Sorry for my delayed response. Depending on the relationship that you have with the birthday recipient, it really doesn’t matter in my opinion. My only exception to what I said is if it’s your significant other. In which case I then I always make sure to be the very first person to wish them a Happy Birthday!! If it’s any other family member, relative, friend etc then I just do my best to make sure I send them wishes on their actual birthday. I’m actually a bit weird though, in that I do like to be the first person to wish the recipient a Happy Birthday when I can. If I can’t be, and they’re someone that is pretty close to me then I will purposefully try to be the very last person to wish them a Happy Birthday - lol!! Now, like I said ‘someone that is pretty close to me’ so they know me well and totally get my bizarre sense of humour in doing such a thing :-P.Significant others, immediate family aside, there is times when life kind of gets in the way and I don’t get the opportunity to wish someone a Happy Birthday on their actual Birthday. In those cases I do send the wishes along as quickly as I can. As I have gotten older it is more important to me to insure that I send the wishes then not, so the particular day though isn’t the most important thing to me any longer. I try, but don’t always succeed on the actual day. My friends that I have missed the actual day though are very understanding, laid back, relaxed, and just appreciate the wishes when they do come…be it the day of, or shortly there after.Everyone is different in how they feel about these things though. When I was younger, then absolutely I did kind of expect the wishes on the actual day. Now that I’m older and more relaxed (not sure I’d say wiser - lol) I still do expect wishes from certain people on the day, but friends get a pass ;-).
if someone wants to open a commercial fm radio station in any city of india how much does it cost and what is the procedure	i want to make a travel commercialclip video hd  for india and new zealand how much will it cost	0	Hi, the first and the foremost thing is the investment. You will require a minimum of 15lakhs for starting an FM radio station. You will need to decide on the type of radio station you wish to start. However you may initially start with a low power FM. This type of radio station operates at lesser power than commercial stations and so they cover a smaller area anywhere near from 500mW to 100W, and may be license-free or alternatively it may be licensed. The exact area they will cover is dependent on terrain and the exact amount of power you are permitted. This level of power is sufficient to cover anywhere between a radius of a few kilometres to several kilometres. Once you are established with this, you may then expand it to a full power licensed radio station. This type of frequency will give station maximum coverage and will enable you to reach as many listeners as possible. During the initial stages you need to determine whether there are frequencies available in your area and also cost the equipment that is needed. Some of the points to consider when looking how to start up an FM radio station include:The process for obtaining an FM frequency and what to look out for How many Watts you will need to achieve the broadcast coverage you want. What your obligations will be when it comes to music royalties What specialist services you need before to assist you in submitting your application for a frequency. What is the most appropriate powered transmitter and what type of antenna would be needed The type of radio automation software that will be used In India the FM radio commercial licences are awarded through open bidding process, if there are more than one application for the advertised city or area . The investment is determined mainly on the basis of the quality of FM Station as well as the current Market price. You may find more details on these from the official website of Ministry of Information and Broadcasting, Government of India under the broadcasting section http://www.mib.nic.in/ . Hope this piece of information is of some help.	A2AExpenditure totally depends on how hardy you are, how smartly you can utilize your network, and how finicky you are about comfort and hygiene.I travelled all across India for 1.2 years on a shoestring budget and the total expenses turned out to be a little less than 1 lac rupees. I have covered the entire India and have spent zilch on lodging, as I have been using my social network to host me at their places. This saves my money majorly and gives me an idea of local people and their cultures. One, if one's 'nih-sankochi' about it, can easily use one's social network and the social network of one's direct contacts to reach people across India. On an average a person has 330 direct contacts on social network and if s/he extends it to the first contact of those persons, it can easily lead you to around a lac people across India. Considering only 1 percent of it to be supposedly hospitable gives you 1000 people around India who could host you just for nights - give you a space to sleep - else you have railway stations, newspapers and platform tickets. The only expense that I encounter is food and travel, both of which I make sure is on a shoestring budget - because I prefer street food, as it allows me to interact with the cook and get to know his story and cheap travel, mostly in general class, allows me to interact with the gentry - the real India - India of the villages.P.S. The itinerary map posted by Anonymous user below is outdated. My journey encompassed over 100 cities and around 40 villages, which will come to picture when my fifth book is released..
why do swiss despise asians	why do technical employees despise sales people so much	0	I have never heard an American express that sentiment or idea, thank goodness. I do not hold or condone that idea.Given that racism continues to be a problem in the United States, I have no problem believing and admitting that there are Americans who hold that idea; however, I do not knowingly have any friends who hold those beliefs.I have friends and coworkers who are of Asian descent — Japanese, Chinese, Korean, Filipino, and Indian and perhaps of other cultures and ethnicities (though I have not made it a point to inquire).Some of these friends and coworkers are nationals of other countries and some are American citizens. Some were born in America and some were born in Asia.It really doesn't matter to me where a person was born or what that person’s ethnicity might be. What matters is that person's character and how that person treats other people, animals and the environment.Certainly, no person is superior to any other person by virtue of race, color, religion or ethnicity.	"It's not universal. There are a few salespeople I've liked alright. (For that matter, my dad was one, and it's something I did for a bit.)But overall, I find I don't like them. And there are some reasons for my annoyance. (This applies to the ones I've actually worked with. If you don't know why people find telemarketers or TV talking heads pitching crap or pushy people behind the counter annoying, I don't know what to tell you.)Lying, or at the very least giving misinformation, and then expecting someone else to fix it for them. If you told a customer the software (or other product) can do something, which in fact it cannot, that is not something that gets treated as an emergency to implement for you. Give the right fucking information next time, don't just say whatever it takes to get the check. And if you're not sure, check before you open your mouth. But you should know what the product you're selling does and doesn't do, or at least know how to find out.Thinking they're in charge. When I was doing startup work, I had more than one in sales think they could come over and try to tell me what I would be working on as a top priority. And then seemed affronted when I told them that they would have to get a PM to move it up, as that was not currently my top item. They seemed to think they could push people around and not follow the process. Granted, I'll be the first one to knock process for the sake of process, but some are there for a reason and really do need to be followed.Pushy. ""No"" means ""no"", not ""rephrase the question slightly and ask it again.""General dishonest temperament and sliminess, especially that constant fake smile, and playing games and politics. If you've got a problem with me or you disagree with me, you discuss it with me. You don't go around behind my back later. Engineers and developers tend to be very honest (sometimes brutally so), but once the matter is settled it's settled, so smile with the knife behind your back and play at politics is not something that goes over well.Not listening, sometimes seemingly deliberately. When I gave you a rough guess as to when something was going to be done, it was a rough guess and I made that clear. It was not a ""commitment"" or anything of the sort. If you went and made it that, you fucked up, not me. Sorry, but especially with breaking new ground, often the answer to ""When will it be done?"" is inexact at best. Developing a new software feature is not like manufacturing a batch of widgets, it's like designing the widgets to start with.Don't do these things, and you'll probably get along with technical types just fine. These aren't true of all salespeople. But in my experience, they're true of way too many."
how can i increase my height after 21 also	can height increase after 25	1	If you work hard and study well for it, you can increase your height by 2 inches after the age of 21. No kidding really.Biologically it is mostly restricted by the age of 19-20 at max.But, if you study relevant stuff, and work your way up to become an astronaut, which is not very hard to achieve, you would travel to outer space.While in that micro-gravity environment, your spine will relieve itself of your weight and expand, by almost 2 inches, depending on your current height and there you have achieved it, a literal increase in height when everyone said it can't be done.You see, where there is a will, there is always a way..	A2ABoys can grow till the age of 25 years. Though after 25 the growth slows down.There are people who have still grown even after crossing 25 years of age.But the results vary from person to person.If you are thinking of gaining 5 to 6 inches then its not possible.However growth can still take place.When you have crossed a certain age limit then only doing exercises doesn’t help.Growth after 25 is determined by SUPPLEMENT+POSTURE+DIET+EXERCISES.I have written supplement first as it plays a very important role if growth is to be seen after 25.People worry about taking supplements but there is nothing wrong if you are taking a safe supplement and with a research proof that it helps in increasing height when taken for few months even if you have closed plates.My own brother took supplement and HGH when he was 16 years and 10 months of age and struggling to increase his height. He was 5.5 at that time. He is now 5.10.Before(LEFT SIDE-MY BROTHER;RIGHT SIDE-ME)AFTER (16 WEEKS)Talking about Posture-Many people don’t just pay attention to their posture. Their incorrect posture makes them look small in height.By doing various exercises in order to correct posture you can look 1 inch to 1.5 taller.Diet-If you are eating nutritious diet but your body is not able to absorb it then it will effect your growth.Eating junk food and soft drinks also hampers growth.Exercises:-Many of my readers are looking for quick solutions in order to increase height.First of all there is not short cut in terms of growing.One has to have patience and follow a set pattern of exercises.Follow these exercises and diet :-Stretches And Exercises To Increase Height and Grow Taller1. JumpOur grandparents have always encouraged us to jump, they claim that it helps you to increase height. Apparently, it’s not a myth. Jumping really helps you grow taller. This is because your spine and calve muscle stretches when you forcefully lift your feet from the ground to jump. For a twist, you may use a skipping rope. Keep jumping, and you’ll attain your desired height in no time.2. Touch Your ToesThis is the most basic stretch to increase the flexibility of the bones and muscles, thus increase the height. Sit on the floor, keeping your back straight. Then extend your legs to the front, keeping your feet close to each other. From the waist, bend and stretch your hands out to touch the toes of your feet. Do not hunch3. Pelvic StretchTo do this stretch, you first need to lie back down and bend your knees. Place your hands by the side and your palms should touch the ground for some support. Then lift your buttocks as high as you can, your back should form an upward curve.Hold it for about 20 seconds. Then do it again, for about three to four times. This stretch will stretch the spine and strengthen your torso.4.Cobra StretchCobra stretch is pretty well known for its potential in increasing one’s height. Lie on your abdomen, then with your palms pressing on the ground parallel to your shoulders, lift your hips off the floor. Again, do not hunch, keep your back straight. Hold this position about 20 seconds then come back down. For beginners, this stretch can cause a burning sensation in your lower neck due to the pressure.5.Monkey Bar HangingAnother common exercise proven to increase your height naturally– and it works. Hanging will give you an amazing result if done regularly, preferably thrice in a week, 10 minutes for each session. Hang on to a monkey bar, you may bend your knees if the bar is too low. You may hang for about 20-30 seconds, and repeat it for 5-7 times.3 Yoga Poses To Grow Taller1.Triangle PoseThe triangle pose when practised regularly can bring many benefits, increase in height is one of them2. Sun SalutationIt does an amazing job in stretching your body muscles overall, particularly the torso and spine. This yoga pose too can help you attain your desired height ...
what were the major effects of the cambodia earthquake and how do these effects compare to the kamchatca earthquakes in 1952	what were the major effects of the cambodia earthquake and how do these effects compare to the valparaiso earthquake in 1822	1	Did you mean Myanmar or Nepal by any chance?Generally, Cambodia is in a low threat region and has no earthquakes. Unless you consider the human ‘earthquake’ of the Khmer Rouge era. That was certainly very destructive on the genocide scale…This article here is interesting because it reports that apparently there was a 5.2 earthquake in 1978. Interestingly enough this was during the most intense atrocities inflicted by the Khmer Rouge, and so there were no journalists in the country and no foreign embassies or expats to know about it.Andrew pike’s answer is correct though. Were it to have an earthquake of any significant impact, there are many buildings that would not sustain strong tremors. That said, so is the case in most of the other lesser-developed countries in Asia…And of course, Cambodia does have its share of floods though. In fact, its culture and economy have largely evolved around a practice of managed flood plains.

what is the difference between sincerity and fairness	what  the difference between honest and sincere	0	EZ:straightforwardness is to say what you think directly (even you’re wrong - sort of “that’s it” , not thoughtful)is more based on instinctive thoughts (not well said or clumsy)honesty is to know you may be wrong but you say it with the whole self-built thoughts: “why you say it ?”.Difference is about you know yourself and count about the reaction of the other not hurt too much also.	What is the difference between a white race of people and a black race of people? This question isn't meant to be discriminatory so be honest, sincere and concise with your answer.

national institute of technology kurukshetra how is the social life at nitk surathkal	national institute of technology karnataka nitk  surathkal to the graduating batch what lessons would you want to give to your juniors before you leave	0	Depends.If you are there already by now , you might be allotted the first or second block out of the three blocks available for the first years . The first and second blocks house three people in each room. If you make it pretty late to the college for the admission process , there is a high probability that you get allotted the seventh block, where two students stay in each room. If you are a DASA student , you don't have any choice but the seventh block it self.Each block has its own merits and demerits.The first and second blocks look neater compared to the seventh. They have furnished rooms (white ceramic tiles flooring) . But the first and second blocks hardly have water. So if you prefer basic amenities over visual appeal prefer the seventh block. Messes are all the same in all the blocks , they suck. I have heard that the first block mess is the best amongst these,but I think it might better with a very less margin.Every room has LAN ports , few work and few don't. Last year , the first and second block didn't have working LAN connection for over three months I guess . The second block has a good TV. The seventh block has a CRT TV. The seventh block has a TT table ( you can play through the night if you want ) . The second block has a better water cooler than the rest.And most importantly.The seventh block doesn't have block timings. If you stay in the first or second block , you have to be back to your hostel block before 10:30pm. But , it was all the same in the second semester last year, no block actually had timings .ThejdeepFinal year CSE	Disclaimer: Following are my personal thoughts. However, I don't intend to propagate it. If you like it, you take or else pass it.1. DO NOT JOIN A PARTY! Though NITs had their individual state reserved system in place, This has been leveraged. However, the things remain the same inside the system. I still feel there remains an animosity among the people based on the Party and Election. Also, DO NOT choose your friends based on the Party. Instead form a good group of friends and interact with Intelligent seniors. Pass the rest!2. WORK SMARTLY!Today's world is competitive. The competition is fierce everywhere. In such situations, you should be skilled. So, Learn some things that gives you an edge over others. Example, Learn UNIX scripting (Perl, Python). For Electrical students, there is still hell lot of other things apart from MATLAB. Have an open mind to learn stuff and keep on going.3. DO NOT JUST SIT IN THE ROOM  AND PLAY DOTA, WATCH SITCOMs or SLEEP etc.Gaming and Sitcoms are good entertainment among your friends. Agreed. But, have a limit to everything. There are so many other things that you can do. Attend your classes. I had a professor in my Dept. who used to say that some of you here may not even get a chance to sit in the classroom again even if you want to. Therefore, I made it a point to attend his classes even if it is 7:55 AM to 8:50 am. Do not be lazy! Exercise. Go to gym or sports complex or swimming and make use of these facilities. You wont get these facilities all at one place anywhere! 4. HAVE A GOAL SET IN YOUR LIFE! Setting goal is a continuous process. As the times go by, your aspirations change. But whatever you do, you should be convinced with yourself that 'OK, This is what I wanted to do. Hence, this is what I will do because it interests me'. IMO, an ideal time for this thought will be around the end of 3rd year. If you still don't know about yourself by then, probably you are going to screw your final year by having lack of focus and trying to get what others want not what you want! FOCUS!5. STUDY HARD!I totally agree with Sai. There will be seniors who will tell you maintain just 7 pointer. Well, In case if you come across any senior, Kindly give a Tight Slap from my side! He is simply unaware of the situations currently. In case if you app for higher studies, GPA counts. If you want to apply for PSU, you will be asked why your CG is less in the interview even though your GATE score may be high. In case a PSU, comes to your college, the low pointers will not be called for the interview (General Category). As far as the admissions for B schools are concerned, there also some weightage is given to your undergraduate GPA. Maintain 8+ with no choice!6. FRIENDS!This is what I have been missing after I left from the college. Value your friendship and moments together. Go for a trek with everyone, spend time together discussing about random topics, Dinner together. Times like this you will never ever get.7. PREPARE A BUCKETLIST OF EVENTS THAT YOU WANT TO DO IN COLLEGE!Do some crazy stuff without getting caught so that you will cherish throughout your life and tell this to your grandchildren when you will be old. :D

what causes a nightmare	what causes nightmares that seem real	1	The brain does some funny things during sleep, not all of which is entirely understood. However, there are some things we do know.For example, we know that memory and emotion in relation to what Freud called “day residue” is partly responsible for the phenomenon.We also know that the images you experience or “see” while sleeping are interpreted in different ways depending on your current situation in life. What I mean by that is, if you’re currently anxious and/or depressed, your dreams will tend to be perceived as dark and unpleasant. Indeed, when we are anxious and depressed, we skew most thoughts negatively and we become pessimistic. Dreams and nightmares specifically tell us that our psychological position on something is not where we want it to be - and we feel conflicted by it. The solution, as your brain is trying to tell you, is to work on the problem instead of trying to ignore it.From my clinical experience, nightmares are most often associated with feelings of inadequacy (for example, “I’m not good enough”) and vulnerability (for example, “People will see me as inadequate, a failure, dumb”).Now, in the wakeful world, these feelings almost always result in anxiety and depression. They become pervasive feelings with an almost constant threat of being judged as inadequate by others because of bad grades, a wrong answer in class, a poor sports or musical performance, a bad presentation, being outsmarted by a brother or sister, an inability to express what you really mean (and getting laughed at), being unable to express your needs to a parent… the list can go on and on. But the key is “VULNERABILITY” and in large part “Shame.”Dreams try to tell us things through symbolism. In the case of nightmares: Being chased, being in a car, plane, train crash, getting attacked by a snake or wild animal, being left behind on a journey, being caught naked, being stuck in a place you don’t know how to get out of, loosing your teeth, being cheated on by your boyfriend or girlfriend…. These are all examples of being in a position of vulnerability.Importantly, people who are overly judgmental of others, often feel the greatest sense of inadequacy and therefore vulnerability. For example, they believe that because they judge others, others must be judging them. The truth is, not everyone judges.All of this can be worked on through therapy.If you’re already seeing a therapist, be honest:“I’m having a lot of nightmares.”“I feel inadequate.”“I think I may be too judgemental of others and this is effecting the way I feel about myself and the way I believe others feel about me.”The dreams are telling you something. They are trying to help. Use them as a tool to help you grow.	The common knowledge holds true, that nightmares are often a reflection of your waking mentalStressing about a looming unpleasantness, as well as anxiety from events passed can cause nightmares. Really traumatic events like car accidents or wars can lead to nightmares with recurring themes, or reliving the event over and over. Healing from the trauma should cause the nightmares to become less frequent and intense over time.If you’re among the 5% of people who have nightmares often enough to affect your waking hours, consider seeing a therapist.Nightmares can also be caused by medications or drugs, especially ones that affect neurotransmitters like antidepressants or narcotics.People who have what psychologists define as “thin boundaries of the mind” are more prone to nightmares too. These people tend to be more creative and imaginative, and sometimes have trouble separating fantasy from reality. There are also idiopathic nightmares, meaning we don’t know why they happen, they just do.So if you have a nightmare every now and again, it’s nothing to worry about. 85% of adults report having nightmares on occasion. They’re more common for children, particularly young girls, and are likely caused when the child is struggling to cope with normal childhood fears.To understand nightmares, and to a larger extent dreams, it helps to know what’s happening in your thinking meat while you’re unconscious. Dreams and nightmares happen during REM (Rapid eye movement ), the last step in the sleep cycle before it starts over. During REM your brain becomes much more active than when you’re in deep sleep.Your amygdala in your temporal cortex starts humming along during REM, and that little guy is responsible for processing memory, decisions, and emotional reactions. And nightmares are a normal part of sleepIf you wake up due to nightmares more often that you’d like, or if you’re struggling to shake them off, there are a few things you can try to banish them from your bedroomStamp out your stress: try some belly breathing or meditation before bed.Don’t eat before bed: food can speed up your metabolism, which makes your brain more active during sleep.Stay away from scary stories, horror movies and these days… the night time news!Keep a consistent bedtime routineGo to sleep and wake up at the same time each dayEnsure your bedroom is cool, dark and quiet
what is abstract expressionism in painting	what are some of the major influences of abstract expressionism	0	There is an immense amount of confusion in art terminology - especially in modern and contemporary art. However, most art terms actually begin by being based in the visual - in a description of what we see when we look at them. So it helps to go back to that when we try to understand them.Expressionism is about expression - about the communication of feelings and sometimes spirit, in art. Artists who are expressionists therefore tend to use a lot of free gestures and intuition in their works, and the word basically gives artists a kind of permission to distort image or to use other unusual techniques in order to convey more feeling (or more spirit). They don’t feel at all bound by traditional conventions when it comes to the pursuit of what is their primary interest - the communication of emotion.Abstraction means to reduce - to abstract, to a larger or smaller degree - the reality of a person or an object to its essential qualities. Traditional abstraction began with some sort of figuration and then distorted that figure, sometimes altering it dramatically, other times, reducing it to a mere gesture. Subsequently, the word began to be applied to gestures that connoted ideas. Kandinsky, for example, created complex compositions which he asserted were representations of music, which could, after all, be reduced to notes on a page - though that wasn’t Kandinsky’s inspiration.Therefore, Abstract Expressionism is artwork that is focused on the expression of feelings, and the primary means of accomplishing that is through abstracting figuration. On this page of answers, there are only two genuine Abstract Expressionist artworks (IMHO): Picasso’s Guernica, and deKooning’s Woman I (3rd work in Juan Pablo Forero’s answer).Still other artists created works with nothing but colors in them, claiming that they were representations of feelings. This was a bridge too far for many critics and historians, who insisted that these were not abstract works at all, but should be called Non-objective art. Again, consider the actual visual. No object = Non-objective. This new category would include most of the artworks on this page - the Pollocks, the Rothkos, etc. They never started with any figurative source. They therefore are abstracting nothing. (Although I believe there are definitely some Pollocks that are abstracts.) Personally, I am in agreement with this position.There are other terms, like Color Field which is a sub-group of Non-Objective Art and primarily about the use of color, and Pop Art, which is very much its own separate thing. As is Conceptual Art - art based on Ideas (Concepts). But once again, if you think about the words in the name, it will almost always connect to what is visually apparent IN the art itself. It’s not really a hidden academic code. It just seems that way sometimes.	"Abstract expressionist were influenced by the vanguards but especially by expressionism itself (the movement that started on 1905) and even more, by surrealism. This movement was influenced by expressionism, I believe, because of the use of colors and because it talks more about emotions than other things, but the actual movement that really was a strong influence was surrealism, because the artists of surrealism search for a way to ""channel the unconscious as a means to unlock the power of imagination"" (taken from www.theartstory.org/movement-surrealism.htm ). The unconscious was a huge part in the abstract expressionist movement as Pollock said when he talked about the Indians Americans and shamanism. He said that if you wanted to get to unconsciousness you go to primitive. In fact, the way he worked was like he was in a ritual and he needed time to connect to do his works.Other influences were people (some european expatriates) who lived though the depression and had lived the second war and the cold war. It's important to notice that, even thought is consider the first Avant-garde of the United States, his first representatives were in fact germans, that were called German Expressionist. It was only later (1946), that the term abstract expressionist was coined by critic Robert Coates.But abstract expressionism is just a way to refer to a really wide movement that was not only abstract. For example, the works of De Kooning are not completely abstract, he pictures women. So the actual description should be ""action painting"", term coined in 1952 by critic Harold Rosenberg."
how does 3d printing work	how do 3d printing work	1	You must have seen a Cake decorating pen used to decorate or write names/wishes on a cake. See the following image for your reference:We decide that Happy Birthday should be thicker - 1 inch. Using this pen, we keep on writing Happy Birthday over and over again, the Happy Birthday will keep on increasing in height. We'll stop when it's 1 inch high. There we have a 3D Happy Birthday wish written, which we can touch and eat!Now, say, we want to write it using wax. We know wax melts on heating and solidifies very quickly if we remove the heat. We design a decorating pen, in which we feed wax as raw material. The pen heats and melts the wax, deposits this melted wax in subsequent layers to write Happy Birthday. Instead of using hand to write, we automate the process. We make a mechanical system which moves the pen on X,Y and Z axes. We have a computer program which controls the movement of this mechanical system. We feed any text or design to the program, the program feeds it to the mechanical system and the pen moves accordingly to deposit wax and write the text/design.This process of deposition and making designs is 3D printing and the automated decorating pen is a 3D printer!!!You can stop reading here, below is a bit detailed explanation of basic 3D printing. I've tried to keep it very simple.In 3D printing, we have a 3D design of a product on computer. Each 3D printer has an interface (program) we feed this design into. The interface has a program, called Slicer, which slices this design in multiple horizontal layers and then sends the coordinates of each layer to the 3D printer. 3D printer has an extruder, similar to decorating pen in the above example, which melts and places the material at respective coordinates (x-axis and y-axis) for each layer. (The first layer is put on a surface called the build-bed/build-plate and subsequent layers are, typically, on the the layers below them) After each horizontal layer, the build-plate moves down or the extruder moves up (z-axis). The process ends with the deposition of topmost layer. This whole process is called 3D printing.The materials used in 3D printing are thermopolymers - the materials which melt above a certain temperature and solidify quickly on cooling.This is Fused Deposition Modelling 3D printing - the prevalent technology for most desktop 3D printers.

You must have seen a Cake decorating pen used to decorate or write names/wishes on a cake. See the following image for your reference:We decide that Happy Birthday should be thicker - 1 inch. Using this pen, we keep on writing Happy Birthday over and over again, the Happy Birthday will keep on increasing in height. We'll stop when it's 1 inch high. There we have a 3D Happy Birthday wish written, which we can touch and eat!Now, say, we want to write it using wax. We know wax melts on heating and solidifies very quickly if we remove the heat. We design a decorating pen, in which we feed wax as raw material. The pen heats and melts the wax, deposits this melted wax in subsequent layers to write Happy Birthday. Instead of using hand to write, we automate the process. We make a mechanical system which moves the pen on X,Y and Z axes. We have a computer program which controls the movement of this mechanical system. We feed any text or design to the program, the program feeds it to the mechanical system and the pen moves accordingly to deposit wax and write the text/design.This process of deposition and making designs is 3D printing and the automated decorating pen is a 3D printer!!!You can stop reading here, below is a bit detailed explanation of basic 3D printing.

what was it like to attend caltech with jeremy ehrhardt	who are some notable folks who attended caltech	0	He's even nicer in person than he seems on TV. I lived in Leverett (House) with him for two years and was decent friends with him and his basketball/football roommates. Even after he graduated and shipped off to the Warriors/Rockets/Knicks/Rockets he's still been very down to Earth and kept close ties with everybody that was a part of his journey to the pros. He loved the awareness Linsanity brought to the groups and causes he cared about, but couldn't have cared less about the personal fame it brought him. Just the kind of guy he is.And in case you thought he was only a single-sport athlete, take a look at what he did to the other team in Harvard's IM football championship...	If by attend you mean to accept people who entered into either the undergrad or graduate program, then picking some names off the wikipedia page James Cho linked to...Arnold Orville Beckman has his name on a few things.  He did invent the pH meter.William Shockley coinvented the transistor, won a Nobel prize for it, and founded one of the initial silicon valley tech companies (Shockley Semiconductor Laboratory).  He was also a vocal eugenicist.  Notable can be good or bad.Harrison Schmitt walked on the moon, and then became a US Senator.Gordon Moore founded Intel.Benoit Mandelbrot was the father of fractals, at least as an area of study.Frank Capra was one of America's most important film directors in the thirties.  And yeah, he got a degree in chemical engineering.Stephen Wolfram created Mathematica, and got his Phd at 20.And as Jessica Su points out, quora was co-founded by Adam D'Angelo, who also served as Facebook's first CTO.
why did harry become a horcrux	what is a horcrux	0	Harry's mother had cast a spell on him that protected him. Since the spell wasn't specific against any particular offensive spell, it probably worked like a jinx, messing with the opposing wizards magic. As such, and given how broken Voldemort's soul already was, it probably didn't take much for the jinx to do a protection by vacuuming off another slice of soul. Horcruxes are darn near impossible to destroy, so it turned into a great protection. With Voldemort, other protections would likely have broken, so the magic jinxed this way. 	A Horcrux is an object, living or dead, that stores a part of the desired wizards’s soul.Simply put, if you want to cut your souls up into pieces then you have to store it in a living body or some ornament, that becomes a Horcrux. This process however dilutes the soul within the main body, and it has huge psychological and slight physical effects.The process of ripping your souls is done by murdering someone. Those deaths must hold a significant value for the wizard, so that their soul with rip under their action. Creating one Horcrux can cause several problems. Voldemort made six.A Horcrux also can’t be destroyed by a regular weapon or spell, and takes something stronger than it (and very rare, like the basilisk venom) to destroy it. The sword of Gryffindor is an ideal weapon for destroying Horcruxes because it absorbs the power of something stronger than it, and once it absorbed basilisk venom in the fight with young Tom Riddle in Chamber of Secrets.So having Horcruxes makes you nearly immortal, since if you die in one body there is still parts of it left in another body. However this is extremely inconvenient since it relies on someone else recovering the soul and transferring it to a body.Creating Horcruxes out of living beings is inadvisable because the thing can think for itself. So it may act in ways not desired by the owner of the soul. The soul can also possess another living object if someone or something becomes too emotionally attached to a Horcrux, whether it be living or dead.Finally, if someone with Horcruxes is to be killed, then all their Horcruxes must be destroyed before attacking the body that hosts the most whole soul.[ Side fact: If a wizard goes on creating too many Horcruxes, they will degrade mentally to the point they are no longer human (like Voldemort)]
what are the best associate product manager apm programs that someone in their early 20s can join to learn product management and have a rewarding career in the company	what are the general requirement to become a product manager or a program manager in a product based software company	0	"Google, Yahoo, Facebook, and Yelp all have APM programs targeted at developing high-potential product managers that are early in their careers.  They're mostly all modeled after the Google APM program which Marissa Mayer (business person) started over a decade ago, so they have similar characteristics.  For example, all of them have a rotational aspect (Google & Yahoo have 2 rotations over 2 years, Facebook has 3 rotations over 1-1.5 years), designed to give you exposure to breadth of experience early-on.  Here are some resources where you can learn more about each of them.  There's also a lot of good answers from current and former APMs on Quora.Google Associate Product Manager (APM) ProgramIn the book ""In The Plex,"" the author had referred to the APM program.

will there really be any war between india and pakistan over the uri attack what will be its effects	will there be a nuclear war between india and pakistan	1	"This would not be the first time, however it is extremely unlikely as both Countries are Nuclear powers and in the modern world, wars are not fought with Arms anymore. Anyway, if ever there is a military war between the two countries, the following would happen : (1) Pakistan would not be able to fight for a very long time.Keeping in mind the economic condition of Pakistan, it would not be possible for them to fight against India for very long. Their economy is already strained and there is no way they can fight for very long. They would soon run out of resources and foreign aid would also dry up.(2) Pakistan's myths would be busted.Pakistan does not enjoy the same support from USA and China as it once did. No doubt that USA and China donate a LOT to Pakistan - both money and arms. But, both USA and China have been favoring India in the last decade due to the booming economy of India. Their long term interest lies with India which is a huge economy with gigantic buying potential. India is a big market for both USA  and China and they would not want their trade to be put in jeopardy. They may not support India, but would neither oppose them. Pakistan would face international isolation as India would play it's economy card. Also, Indian diplomacy is far better than that of Pakistan. (3) Pakistan ""will"" use Nuclear weapons.Pakistan already understands that in the current scenario there is no way they can face India in a conventional battle. India's economy and military has far surpassed any Pakistani competence. Their only option is to use Nuclear power against India as that would be the only hope - false hope maybe. Pakistan does not have any credible missile that can carry a nuclear warhead deep enough in India to avoid any ill affect on Pakistan itself. Pakistan cannot detonate a Nuclear missile in Punjab or neighboring areas, as there will always be a risk of Pakistani territory being affected by it. They can only risk ""dropping"" the bomb through an aircraft. It is highly doubtful that any Pakistani aircraft would be able to do that in sophisticated Indian airspace. (4) Russian/Israel support.Both Russia and Israel will offer support to India. However, any help would not be needed from them. They would only be asked to keep an eye on the movements of China and USA and share their intelligence information. There is only ONE way this war can end - With total destruction of Pakistan and heavy loss to India as well. However, India would survive and rebuild but Pakistan would be removed from the Map of the world. G'day"	Definitely, There will be a War between India & Pakistan in future. Nothing is justified as the war happening in Near Future as future has no accurate predictions either it’s near or distant . But the Scenario will be different & Impact would be huge…I am not talking about the 3rd World War. The current shift in Geopolitics in South Asia has developed a new scenario for India & Pakistan. The historical background of both countries is not quite strange when US sent her 7th Naval Fleet to support Pakistanis in 1971 war on a motive by launching a military offensive against India whereby Soviet Union jumped to rescue of India at Former PM Indira Gandhi’s request by dispatching a Nuclear Submarine Flotilla.But, the era in the 20th & 21st century is completely different. After India’s Capitalist economic policy in 1991 & successful Nuclear test in 1998, US tilted towards India at a faster rate. Looking at the Trillions dollar Market & Huge economic potential, US gave several gifts to India to keep her away from Russia. The recent developments in the last 5 years have indicated the evolution of a new war strategy between India & Pakistan ..After coming Pro-USA & right-wing BJP gov on power, India has moved closer to North America providing a gap with Russia. The major steps are taken by the USA has proved American strategy to make India their Girlfriend & believes in empowering Indians so that they can counter Chinese narrative in ASIA. Those major steps taken by USA areRecognising India as a Major Defence Partner.Then, India and United States signed the Logistics Exchange Memorandum of Agreement (LEMOA) in 2016.US supported India to get permanent entry into MTCR, Australian Group & Wassennar arrangement in 2016–18 & quite optimistic about India’s NSG entry.US also grants india under Strategic Trade Authorisation-1 list which provides India greater supply chain efficiency, both for defence and for other high-tech products, that will increase activity with US systems, the interoperability of the systems, and it will reduce time and resources needed to get licensing approved.Under these Schemes, US is planning to supply high end weapons like Predator-B Armed Drones, THAAD to india while for better secured communication systems, US is batting to sign COMCASA with India. Both countries are also holding 2+2 talks to deepen their military & economic partnership.While on the Other hand, Pakistan & Russia are getting closer, their recent activities also show the efforts to counter American narrative with India.Russia supplied Mi-17v5 helicopters to Pakistan despite Indian protest.Russia also allowed Pakistani military training on their homeland after US permanently cancelled Training programme with Pakistan.Russian behaviour with Pakistanis are testifying Indians that don’t get into American camp. If Pakistani are thinking, Russia will support them against India in a war, then it would be believed that either Pakistanis are dreaming or enjoying Mujras. Infact, Russians cannot afford losing a trusted friend like India. They have already over $10 Billion dollars military deal in pipeline, under which India will procure 5 systems of S-400 BMD costing $5 billion, 4 Advanced Frigates ($4 Billion), 1 SSN ($2 Billion) & K-226T LUH ($1 billion) from them.We know Pakistani relationship with chinese protrated as Higher than mountains & deeper than seas. Chinese are empowering Pakistani military by providing them JF-17,Ballistic Missiles , HQ-7 SAM & others. Major chunk of Pakistani military weapons comes from China. Pakistanis now-a-days realising that CPEC is no longer solution to give impetus to their Fragile economy & International organisations like IMF, WB are being hesitant to provide fund to Pakis. Everybody knows if you don't pay off loans at given time, then what happens with your property on that next day. So, there is a possibility of Pakistan becoming a colony of Chinese & You will see inbetween next 3–4 years Pakistan having Yuan as domestic currency & Mandarin as their official language.So analysing all these activities, we can conclude about Future India & Pakistan war with some major points…If war happens, India will have support from maximum countries including all major powers.India will have both USA & Russia backing during war with Pakistan.India’s probability on fighting two front war is more when it comes to war with Pakistan in future as China wants to occupy Pakistan due to its Geographical advantage..once China occupied Pakistan, then would be able to control entire Energy route of Asia.Majority of arab countries will support India beacuse of its economic significance.Israelis’ blood aren't yet cold as they haven't avenged the death of their citizens died in 26/11 terror attcak. Therefore, Mossad can launch Cyber Warfare against Pakis by giving an unprecedented edge to India in the battle.This war will be the Do or Die scenario for both nations. Beacuse………If Pakistan wins , India will face Gazwa-e-Hind & Huge human disaster will happen.If India wins , there will no Pakistan in the World map..Thank you For Reading…
did ronald reagan have a mannerism in his speech	how did ronald reagan react to 911	0	"Update below with additional context.His son believed that he did. In an article [1] about Reagan at 100, a memoir Ron Reagan wrote after his father's death, he's quoted as follows:""Watching the first of his two debates with 1984 Democratic presidential nominee Walter Mondale, I began to experience the nausea of a bad dream coming true. At 73, Ronald Reagan would be the oldest president ever reelected...[M]y father now seemed to be giving them legitimate reason for concern. My heart sank as he floundered his way through his responses, fumbling with notes, uncharacteristically lost for words. He looked tired and bewildered.""Two years later the president expressed his own concern about his failing memory:“My father might himself have suspected that all was not as it should be. As far back as August 1986 he had been alarmed to discover, while flying over the familiar canyons north of Los Angeles, that he could no longer summon their names.”Ron Reagan writes that there is “no evidence that my father (or anyone else) was aware of his medical condition while he was in office.”“Had the diagnosis been made in, say, 1987, would he have stepped down? I believe he would have.”In 1994, President Reagan revealed to the nation that he had been diagnosed with Alzheimer’s. But earlier, in 1989, doctors operating on Reagan expressed their belief he was suffering from the degenerative disease.Ron Reagan writes that in July 1989, his father was thrown off a horse while visiting friends in Mexico. He received medical attention at a hospital in San Diego. When surgeons opened the president’s skull to relieve pressure they “detected what they took to be probable signs of Alzheimer’s disease.” But no formal diagnosis was given.The explanation given in the anonymous answer on this page for the lack of a diagnosis, especially early on, seems plausible and is not contradicted by the former president's son's recollections.Update thanks to Brady Postma: As it happens, Ron Reagan's claims were attacked by others who were close to his father, including Michael Reagan, Ronald Reagan's adopted son from his first marriage. There may be some bias introduced into his recollection due to lingering resentment about his upbringing and his ideological divergence from his father, or countless other reasons. I'd like to note some additional context, first from journalist Barbara Walters.“The 100th birthday of President Ronald Reagan is coming up and his son has a new book, ‘My Father at 100,’ where he claims in the book that his father showed signs of Alzheimer’s during his first term in office – specifically mentions the 1984 presidential debate with Democrat Walter Mondale, where Ron, Jr. writes that his father looked lost and bewildered,” Walters said on ABC’s Tuesday broadcast of “The View.” “Well, as it happens, I was a moderator of that debate. It was in 1984. It was an hour and 40 minutes. That’s a long time. And maybe he stumbled over one answer or so forth. But I don’t remember — an hour and 40 minutes to answer questions and to answer questions from a panel, and he was with it.”Those allegations have sparked a family feud between Ron Reagan and President Reagan’s adopted son Michael Reagan. (The two brothers haven’t always seen eye-to-eye on politics.) But according to Walters neither son was particularly close to the president during those years. She also claimed she spent more time with President Ronald Reagan than either son and always witnessed Reagan being of sound mind.“Ron, Jr.’s half-brother Michael said this is not true. This didn’t happen,” she continued. “I’m going to say…that I probably saw more of President Reagan in those years than either of his sons. He was not really close to them. And I did interview after interview. I didn’t see any signs of dementia or Alzheimer’s or whatever until after he left office. Now, this morning, Ron Reagan, who is a very pleasant fellow and I like him a lot, was on ‘GMA’ and he said – he sort of disputed what he said. He said I didn’t say that. I said exactly the opposite. I did not see symptoms of dementia or anything like that when he was in office. I wasn’t thinking, ‘Gee I’m seeing signs of Alzheimer’s here.’ So his half-brother says he said all of this because he’s trying to sell books.” [2]See also Mike Reagan's reaction:Ron Reagan's comments have ticked off his half-brother, Michael Reagan, who was adopted by Ronald Reagan and his wife, actress Jane Wyman, 13 years before Ron was born to Reagan and his second wife, Nancy Reagan. Michael, a firebrand conservative, has slammed Ron for concocting ""falsehoods and lies and conspiracy theories to sell books."" (Ron and Michael haven't spoken since the reading of the will following their father's death in 2004.) Michael claims there is no evidence his father had developed Alzheimer's while in office: ""I saw my father on and off and I never saw anything that looked like that."" And the Ronald Reagan Library and Foundation has issued a statement noting that ""this subject has been well documented over the years by both President Reagan's personal physicians, physicians who treated him after the diagnosis, as well as those who worked closely with him daily. All are consistent in their view that signs of Alzheimer's did not appear until well after President Reagan left the White House."" [3]As a final note, the difficulty of diagnosing Alzheimer's onset all these years later is highlighted by the article quoted above (How Close Did Lesley Stahl Come to Reporting Reagan Had Alzheimer's While in Office? Very Close). What Stahl describes could be the result of any number of causes —medications, sleep deprivation (at advanced age), stress, etc.— and Stahl herself could be mistaken or biased, as could the reporting in Mother Jones.It's obviously a difficult question, and in any event even the anonymous aide quoted in the article says ""He would come to life for the cameras. He was on/off, on/off,"" which could mean many things (again with caveats about that aide's credibility, intentions, etc.). No one can really say what effect any of these things had on his capabilities, either. Most of what's written comes to speculation, much of it driven by ideological preferences.Notes1. President Reagan suffered from Alzheimer's while in office, according to son.2. Barbara Walters disputes Ron Reagan’s book claims about father’s mental state 3. How Close Did Lesley Stahl Come to Reporting Reagan Had Alzheimer's While in Office? Very Close."	Probably not. His Alzheimer’s had taken quite a toll. By February of 2001 he was isolated because he could only recognize his wife Nancy and a couple other people, and although he had lucid moments they were less and less common - and the family didn’t want people to remember him like that.So by September it is very likely he didn’t see them, was kept away from the news, or maybe wouldn’t have understood what he was seeing. Also, for a man who was memory-disabled, he was quite busy with physical therapy due to a broken hip that January.If he ever said anything, only his immediate family would know.He died in 2004, but a lot of people said the person he was, was gone before then.
what were the war strategies of the union and the confederates during the civil war	how could the confederates have possibly defeated union forces at gettysburg during the american civil war	0	I think the question has been expertly answered already. However, I would like to add just a bit to the discussion, which hopefully may expand on the answers already provided.The Civil War (or as it was called when I was growing up, the “War Between The States” or the ‘War of Northern Aggression”) was not expected to last much beyond six or eight weeks. During the First Battle at Bull Run, people from Washington and Richmond showed with their wives and children, their friends, girlfriends and had a picnic while watching the fighting from their advantage points on the surrounding hillsides! Even when Fort Sumter was being fired on,ordinary people (and sometimes with their families and children) came out to watch as if it was a Fourth of July celebration). Can you even imagine that? But that was the attitude of many of those on both sides.Lincoln had an army, but it wasn’t well trained and even worse led. He had access to a better supply (and quality) of weapons and ammo. He had the economic advantage to by the North being so industrialized. It had the infrastructure for industry…or war. It had an established political structure and system of government, including diplomatic ties.There was also the Abolitionists who were something like zealots for their particular cause. However, there were many in the North worth felt support for the South, so there was widespread riots,protest, and draft evasion. Some Northerners secretly aiding the South as well. Lincoln’s chief concern was in keeping the Union together. Any other issue could and would be addressed later.The South was primarily rural. It was mostly small “Yeoman” farms and a smattering of plantations (despite popular myth). It had excellent ports and meanings for inter-coastal shipping and a small fleet of ocean going merchant sailing ships. There was some industry, but nothing compared to the North. While it had railroads, it was nowhere as extensive as that of the North. For that matter, neither was its infrastructure.The Succession began, many of those in the military, especially among the senior officers and more experienced junior officers, had a decision to make; whether to fight for the Federal Government in which they had taken an oath of allegiance when they enlisted or resign the commissions and return home to defend their state and their family. It was a hard decision. However, most of the Federal officers most experienced, trained, and most talented, opted for the latter (as an aside, Lincoln had intended to ask Robert E Lee to take charge of the Union forces). In due course, each state, county, town or city, and family had to make a similar decision.The South had to almost literately create a functional government, a legal and financial system, Constitution and army from scratch “on the run” as the saying goes. Contrary to popular myth, Jefferson Davis, the first and only President of the Confederacy, was not a “racist” or fool. He was, however, considered to be one of the most intelligent, able, and respected legislators in Congress. He brought together an entire array of individuals of similar caliber (an interesting fact. Davis’ government contained to the first ever cabinet position held by someone who was Jewish, Judah Phillip Benjamin).As if he didn’t have enough problems, the vote for Succession, which was done county by county, was nowhere near unanimous (there was enough “no” votes in the Northeast part of Virginia, that it “succeeded” from Virginia and went on to become the State of West Virginia). That meant there would be those who might fight for the North, refuse conscription or become deserters. Lastly, the South didn’t have an established Army. It also didn’t have access to the arms and supplies that the North did. The South also didn’t have the population that the North did.What the South hoped (idealistically I suppose) was that they would ultimately be allowed to go there on way and, perhaps, in time after tensions receded, would resume some sort of trade and treaty arrangement with the North. Meanwhile, what the South desperately needed was time; time to overlay a government over the former Federal one; time to establish its economy and build trade and diplomatic alliances (initially, France and England supported the South) as well as its infrastructure (especially it communications and railroads). It needed time to build up a military and a navy capable of keeping its ports open and, if necessary, of protecting its merchant fleet. It had the majority of the nation’s best and brightest military minds, but without weapons and ammo at least matching the enemy, ample food and medical supplies, means of transportation, there was just so much they could do.Nevertheless, I have to point out that despite all these obstacles, man for man, the South proved to have the best fighting man. These were mostly country boys used to hunting—-many were crack shots, tracking, riding for long periods of time, camping out doors, and foraging. They also seemed to have the most resolve, despite little food or medicine, no shoes, or rags for clothes.As for the North, their success on the battlefield was certainly no slam dunk sure thing as Lincoln and much of his Cabinet knew. Lincoln’s objective had been to keep the Union united. I believe he was hoping that a few swift and decisive victories would at least open channels to talk about reunification. However, that didn’t happen, and it appeared it would never happen, that is, until a watershed moment…Gettysburg. The Battle of Gettysburg was not intended to happen. Neither side planned around it. It was simply a fluke. It was a Confederate victory insomuch as it showed Lincoln and his Generals that the South could strike in the North (it turned out to be the first and only time it ever did). It was a disaster in that many men were lost as well as badly needed supplies. It was a Northern victory inn that it stopped as massive Confederate assault far into the North. It was a loss in that they too lost many men.The end result of a tactical tie. It showed Lincoln that the South was in this for the long haul. Thus, Lincoln took a gamble and changed strategies based on the results of Gettysburg. Despite promises made in his first election regarding the institution of slavery, when Lincoln gave his famous Gettysburg Address, he proclaimed “freedom” for all slaves in the South who wanted it. As magnanimous as it sounded, its real intent was purely militarily.First, Lincoln knew that his proclamation carried no legal weight in the South; they had left the Union and the Confederacy had its own Constitution and its own laws. Nevertheless, its intended effect was to entice slaves to leave the farms; which would in turn leave crops to rot in the fields, and that would result in mass starvation starting with the families of the Confederate soldiers. Lincoln hoped Confederate troops would leave the fighting to return home to their families and the fields; to a large degree it worked.	Michael Settle and Ian Marshall posted what I think were excellent answers.After the Battle of Chancellorsville, Robert E. Lee was intent upon taking the war to enemy territory. His home state of Virginia had been ravaged by war and it was time to give it a break. It's true that his most trusted lieutenant, Thomas Jackson was dead and there's speculation that Lee may have been stricken by an illness, perhaps a heart attack. But the Army of Northern Virginia and its commander were supremely confident. The Confederate forces moved into Pennsylvania, its mission: forage, capture Harrisburg and gain a victory great enough to warrant European recognition of the CSA. It was forage that led a small group of Rebels into Gettysburg. They were looking for shoes. There they met the advance elements of the Army of the Potomac. From there the conflict grew larger as both armies funneled troops into Gettysburg. Lee recalled his vanguard, well on its way to a poorly defended Harrisburg. Meade concentrated his Union Army on ridges and rocky outcropings affecting a defensive posture. Lee assaulted the Federal right at Culp's Hill, 1st day. He was thrown back. Then he attacked the Federal left, Little Round Top, 2nd day. After the repulse of the Rebel forces at Little Round Top, one of Lee's Corps commanders, Pete Longstreet, after studying the tactical situation, suggested leaving a small force facing the Union Army, withdraw the main Confederate forces, move around the Union left, almost unopposed and poise itself between the Army of the Potomac and its Capitol, Washington D.C. Then the Rebels could fight on the ground of their choosing. Remember Lee was an exceptional engineer. He designed the killing fields of Fredericksburg and Cold Harbor. Longstreet was rejected and his corps wrecked on Gettysburg's 3rd day, ‘Longstreet's Assault', or as it is popularly known as 'Pickett's Charge.’Why did Lee reject Longstreet? Perhaps it was the absence of his cavalry commander J.E.B. Stuart and the vital information he desperately needed for his army's survival in enemy territory. Maybe it was hubris, his confidence in the men of his command and their cause. Or maybe he didn't fully recover from his supposed ailment after Chancellorsville and the death of Stonewall Jackson.Pete Longstreet would go on later in 1863 to help win a brilliant victory at Chickamauga.
which is the best fiction novel of 2016	which are some of the best fiction novels	0	A Court of Mist and Furyby Sarah J. MaasFeyre survived Amarantha's clutches to return to the Spring Court—but at a steep cost. Though she now has the powers of the High Fae, her heart remains human, and it can't forget the terrible deeds she performed to save Tamlin's people. Nor has Feyre forgotten her bargain with Rhysand, High Lord of the feared Night Court. As Feyre navigates its dark web of politics, passion, and dazzling power, a greater evil looms—and she might be key to stopping it. But only if she can harness her harrowing gifts, heal her fractured soul, and decide how she wishes to shape her future—and the future of a world cleaved in two.	The Sun Also Rises by Ernest Hemingway - often regarded as the first modern novel, features Hemingway’s pared down descriptive style and honest language. It is also a very fine story of a love that can never be.Slaughterhouse 5 by Kurt Vonnegut - fictionalized account of a man’s journey through PTSD told in Vonnegut’s unique brand of satire.To Kill a Mockingbird by Harper Lee - the story of an every day hero told through the eyes of his young daughter. In extraordinarily readable prose, Lee delivers a sermon on equality and pre-judgement.The Call of the Wild by Jack London - beautiful story telling that says something important about the thin line between wildness and civility.1984 by George Orwell - a warning about a society lulled into enslavement by gradually trading convenience and security for their freedom. (giving this book a run for its money would be Brave New World or A Clockwork Orange)The question is a little generic - my answer would vary if the slant was the 5 best enjoyable reads or the 5 best for a military officer or manager, etc - these five are the five that I think are most important balancing literary significance and quality of story/writing across a range of human experience.

what  the difference between love and pity	what is the difference between love and pity	1	"What is the difference between the feelings of affection, attraction, trust, intimacy, love, true love, lust, crush, infatuation, obsession, passion, and compassion? Are they synonyms? How do you know that you are really ""in love""?"	Pity is the compassionate sorrow we feel towards the suffering of others.Love can be defined many ways, but for simplicity I will define it as a deep feeling that binds one person to another. It can mean many kinds of love - the love of friends, the love of one’s pet, but it is romantic love we are most interested in and that’s the definition I will address.You can feel pity towards someone you love, if they are suffering, but if you take the pity away, what do you have left to feel for them?It is easy to mistake the two. Sometimes, we meet someone for whom we feel deep pity. Compassion moves us, makes us want to hold them, care for them, help them, heal them. So many relationships begin this way. One cares for the other, and it is this ebb and flow of pity and suffering that defines and supports the relationship. It isn’t to say that love cannot grow out of a relationship that begins with pity, but if pity is mistaken for love, again, what remains when the suffering is gone? What is left when the wounds have healed?Often people fall back from relationships they thought were love, confused and torn because they feel the loss of the relationship and only later realize that it was not love they felt, but pity. They may feel that the love was a lie, but it was that they were confused by their feelings, that what they thought was love might have only been sorrow for the suffering of the other, and after they give each other solace - nothing of substance remains. We often cling long to failing relationships moved by our pity, confusing it for love.There is in romantic love always the question of endurance to be reckoned with. We ask ourselves if the relationship we are in will endure, whether it should last. We worry whether the love is real, or whether it is some other feeling that feels like love. We wonder what the other feels for us. Great shows of compassion can feel like loving attention, and it can make the giver feel like they are acting out of love - because compassion is a kind of love. It just isn’t that ideal romantic love which we so often compare all love to, and so often find all our loves falling short.At the end of these confused relationships, we often hear one hurt partner say, “I don’t want your pity.” What they often mean is: “I wanted your love, but all you offer is your pity, and that’s not enough and I can’t stay with you if that’s all you can give me.” The imbalance inherent in the relationship causes it to tip over and break apart, but we don’t always see it until the illusion is shattered. We have mistaken pity for love.
how competitive is the hiring process at republic bank	how competitive is the hiring process at s  and  t bank	0	Not sure of your reason for asking all the many “How competitive is the hiring process” questions for many different companies. Are you applying at those companies or just curious?How is that going to help you get a job at any of these companies? Are you assuming that the less competitive, the better your chance of getting a job there?And who do you expect to know how competitive the process is except for the company’s HR staff?Furthermore, what constitutes “competitiveness” in seeking jobs at a company? The number of people applying? Maybe. The qualification and testing process for the job? Maybe. The educational and experience requirements? Maybe.If your questions are attempting to determine how likely you are to getting a job in these companies, I don’t think any answers you receive are going to help much.	Its fairly competitive. Expect lots of behavioral and situational questions. They want to select the best and most coach-able people. If you have industry expertise, I assume you are worth more in Gartner’s eyes, but as a recent college graduate in their interview process, I can say that it is quite a bit challenging.But the recruiters are very helpful in helping you prepare for the next round(s) as you complete them.
how google helps in spam ranking adjustment of the search results	what is the distribution of traffic between google organic search results  eg  1 vs 2 in rankings first page vs second page	0	There are many factors that determine your position in the SERPs.And I feel that Google reviews at the moment are not a huge ranking factor.I feel that quality backlinks are still the primary driving factor for climbing to the top of Page One.But, that is not all.Quality content of 1,500 words or more enhanced with images and video also contribute to pg one rankings.Have you switched over to HTTPS yet? (another contributing factor)Bounce rate (how fast someone leaves your site) is another factor which in some cases could also be directly connected with how fast your website pages load.Both are ranking factors.Although, I do believe that one day Google will be increasing the importance of Google Maps Reviews in the algorithm at least for local rankings.But today, I am not seeing consistent results in regards to the sheer volume of Google reviews and the placement in the SERPs or the Google Local Snack Pack.Although, if you are a local business owner I would consider making every effort to build up your Google Business Listing Reviews.Every time your customer is checking out make sure you ask for the review.Check this post out: Why are Google reviews important?If you are not asking for a Google review, your first reviews will quite likely be negative.I do feel that having plenty of positive Google reviews will give you a better chance of gaining new customers.Research has alway been one of those things that we do.We call around and find the best price.We ask our friends who they trust.In the good old days, we even used something called a phone book.It was made from paper, and all the businesses were listed alphabetically and categorically.Businesses would be able to buy ad space to capture more customers or pick a name that starts with A.But, now we don't need to ask our friends or read a book.We hop on the Big G, and we are instantly presented with all of our options complete with public opinions.So, I don't think that Google Reviews make a huge difference when it comes to search ranking.I Do Believe they make a huge difference when it comes to choosing which local business to use.If you want some 4 and 5 star Google Reviews you should contact me immediately!Visit my website Best SEO, Google Reviews Repair, and Video MarketingLet me know You Want 30 Days of my Google Reviews Repair Service for Free.

is america the most powerful country of the world	why is the america the most powerful country of the world	0	A lot of people only ranked countries based on military power, but they fail to realize the importance of soft power. So, I will list both. It is 10/2/2018 right now, for any future reader that will read this.Soft Power(in no particular order):United StatesThe U.S. is undoubtedly a very powerful soft power. Hollywood has the most successful movie industry to date by far, and spreads American culture worldwide. The U.S. is also considered the symbol of democracy, freedom, and capitalism(although ironically, neither the most democratic, free, and capitalist country). Although the recent America-first policies ventured by Donald Trump has somewhat decreased the soft power of the U.S., it still remains very influential in world politics today. It is a permanent member of the U.N. security council too.United KingdomBritain exerts its influence to a great many number of countries, especially to mainland Europe and the members of the Commonwealth. Due to its days as the most powerful and widespread empire on Earth, parts of Africa and North America is undoubtedly impacted by the days of its occupation. For example, English is the second most spoken first language as well as the most spoken second language, and British sports like football(the one that actually uses the foot mostly), cricket, tennis, and golf are among the most played today.South KoreaSouth Korea has only begun to have relevant soft power very recently, from the effects of the Korean Wave, or Hallyu. The spread of K-pop, Korean food, and Korean culture has truly been almost miraculously fast.JapanDo I really need to explain this one? Anime, J-pop, East Asian politics, Henta-I mean, adult animation.FranceFrance has the most annual tourists in the world, and, much like the U.K., exerts great influence over many of its former colonies and the rest of Europe. It is also part of more multi-lateral organization than any other country in the world, and, according to Soft Power 30 , has the best leader in the world in terms of engagement.Other countries that I do not have the willpower or time to mention, but still deserve a place:IndiaChinaGermanyRussiaItalySpainVatican CityMilitary Power(in order of strength)U.S.AForget about China’s South Sea ambitions. Forget about Russia. Forget about North Korea’s nukes.Without doubt, any speculation, or any thought, I can confidently say that the United States of America is the absolute, unchallenged military superpower in the world as of today.Not India. Not China. Not Russia. The U.S., and only the U.S. I dare anyone to challenge me on this claim.It has hundreds of the most powerful jet fighter(and the only “real” 5th gen. fighters) in the world, about half of the world’s AEGIS or similar-to-AEGIS ships in the world, and 2/3 of all the aircraft carriers in the world. It also has the most 3rd and 3rd+ gen. tanks in the world, the best power projection in the world, by far the highest military budget, the biggest military industry, and the only actual stealth bombers.You know something’s going on if the world’s second strongest air force is part of your navy.A fraction of America’s full might, but enough to destroy the navies and air forces of a country with a military on the ranks of 25+2. RussiaAlthough far from a superpower after the collapse of the Soviet Union, Russia still maintains the second most powerful conventional military in the world. It still leads the non-western world in terms of military technology in almost all areas, and actively continues to develop them. They have the second strongest army, the third strongest air force(if you count the U.S. Navy), and 3-4th strongest navy(this is very disputable, but it’s my own estimate.).3.

how do you obtain an instant ulcer pain relief	what is better for a low back pain heat or ice	0	Finding Lower Back Pain ReliefNearly everyone will experience some form of back pain in his or her lifetime. The low back is the area behind the belly from the rib cage to the pelvis and is also called the lumbar region. Back pain is a major cause of missed work. Low back pain usually resolves on its own and is commonly the result of a strain injury. There are many treatments for low back pain.At Risk for Lower Back Pain?Low back pain can start in a person's early twenties and continue on throughout adulthood. Studies have shown that up to 80% of the general population are affected by low back pain (LBP) at some time during their lives. Learn to prevent lower back pain by knowing what activities could be putting you at risk.Common Causes of Low Back PainManual materials handling (especially lifting)Twisting of the trunkBending the trunk forwardBending the trunk to the sideExcessive reachingFallsProlonged sittingSedentary jobsHighly physical jobsExposure to whole-body vibrationCigarette smokingObesityExtreme tallnessLow Back Pain Symptoms: Does Your Back Hurt?Low back pain symptoms range from sharp and stabbing to a dull ache. The pains can be constant or intermittent and positional. Acute low back pain can appear suddenly after injury. Chronic back pain is defined as pain lasting more than three months. Consult a doctor if you have prolonged back pain longer than 72 hours.Low Back Pain and Serious Back InjuriesSevere back pain after an injury should be evaluated by a health-care professional. Warning signs of more serious injury include pain with coughing or urinating, loss of control of the bowels or bladder, new leg weakness, and fever. These additional symptoms require medical evaluation.Is It Muscle Strain or Sciatica?Back pain that occurs after excessive exercise or heavy lifting is frequently a strain injury. However, occasionally these activities cause disc injury and rupture or herniation. When a herniated disc irritates the sciatic nerve, it can cause back pain.What is Sciatica?Sciatica is a form of nerve pain caused by pressure on the sciatic nerve. The sciatic nerve is a large nerve that runs down through the buttocks and extends down the back of the leg. Pressing on or pinching of the sciatic nerve causes shock-like or burning low back pain. Sometimes people feel as if the pain radiates down through the buttocks and down one leg, sometimes even reaching the foot.Is Your Job Causing Back Pain?A job that involves pulling, lifting, or twisting with the low back can cause injury and low back pain. Even prolonged sitting in an awkward position can cause low back pain. Standing on your feet for hours on end? That can cause lower back pain too. The best way to prevent back pain is to know if you are at risk.Jobs That Can Cause Lower Back PainAirline crew (pilots, baggage handlers)SurgeonsNurses & healthcare workersBus and cab driversWarehouse workersConstruction workersCarpet installers and cleanersFarmers (agricultural, dairy)Firefighters and policeJanitorsMechanicsOffice personnel (eg, telemarketers, file clerks, computer operators)Find Back Pain Relief: Lighten Your BagsCarrying an overstuffed purse, briefcase, or handbag can strain the low back. If you must carry a heavy load, consider using a wheeled briefcase instead. By reducing the amount of weight you're carrying, you reduce the amount of pressure on the spine. Help keep your kids' backs healthy by making sure their backpacks are not overloaded. A heavy backpack could mean future back pain for your little ones.Workouts That Can Cause Low Back PainMost athletic injuries to the back are sprains of the ligaments or strains of the muscles surrounding the spine. Serious conditions or complications can have similar symptoms to those of a routine sprain or strain. The most common sports injuries occur after repetitive overuse of the spine either through twisting, compr...	Image via MedSyndicateThere’s some conflicting advice out there on whether you should use heat or cold for lower back pain. A study back in 2006 found that heat decreased acute low-back pain immediately after application. As for cold, there was not enough evidence to pull any information on whether it actually helped or not. With that said, the 2006 studies had a very small pool of participants, so can it might ultimately not be an accurate representation on the effects of hot and cold.With that said, the most popular suggestion for decreasing back pain is as follows:In the first 24 to 72 hours, use ice to help reduce inflammation, pain and swelling. You can use a cold pack, iced towel, frozen vegetables or ice cup. In the first 72 hours ice the area for 10 minutes every hour if you can. Then you can go to icing 3 times a day.After 72 hours, start applying heat to encourage healing. Heat helps stimulate blood flow, inhibits pain and decreases stiffness. Moist heat (hot packs, baths or showers) work better than electric heating pads. Still, if you need some pain relief during the day, consider using an all-day heat wrap.You can also try alternating between hot and cold, using heat for 15 minutes first then cold an hour later for another 10 to 15 minutes.Chronic back painImage via Sunrinity HealthThe above advice works well if you’re experiencing pain after an injury. But what if you have chronic pain? Most office workers likely have some form of chronic lower back pain due to poor posture when sitting and just sitting down for 8+ hours a day. If this sounds like you, then you might want to look into some other options to help manage your pain:Lower back braces can help support the lower back, which alleviates some of the lower back pain. There are a variety to choose from for men and women.Get a chair support to improve your posture when sitting at your work desk.Exercise can help improve back pain as it strengthens your core and back muscles.Improve your sitting and standing posture as bad posture can strain your muscles.Get a massage to help relieve muscle tension, spasms, inflammation and stiffness. Not to mention it can help improve circulation and flexibility. Go to a certified professional for best results.If your consistent lower back pain is hindering your usual activities, the best thing you can do is go to your doctor to get it checked out. It might be a bigger health issue than you realize. Luckily, most lower back pain can be treated without surgery so long as it’s treated immediately.Disclaimer - This advice should not be taken in lieu of medical advice. If you have lower back pain from an injury or chronic back pain, speak to your doctor or medical professional.

what does taking advantage of someone mean	is it worse to take advantage of someone or be materialistic	0	It's an interesting question. I do a lot of volunteer work. So, in essence, many people have ‘taken advantage‘ by something I've done. That's a good thing. I had an opportunity to give of myself, someone feels helped by it, and I feel good about having been helpful.But usually when someone expresses feeling taken advantage of, they mean it negatively. They are feeling ‘used’. That's not a good thing.No one can ‘take advantage of you’ without your consent. What I mean is that you have had to be a participant in it. Often when a person feels used is because they have given of themselves and feel unappreciated. Or they have given of themselves disproportionately. In either case, the person has consciously or unconsciously allowed themselves to be taken advantage of. Sometimes it's because of wanting to be liked. Sometimes it's because of low self-esteem. Best solution is to give of yourself freely and honestly, but only to the extent that you choose. Learn how to say ‘no’.	So from where I left off, My sister got angry, viewing from a “daughters” perspective, because my mom cared more about the car, then her own daughter’s life. My mom even cried over seeing the car destroyed. So, in this situation, I can kind of understand my mom caring more about the car, because at that time, we only had one car, my mom’s car, and she used that to get to work, take any of us to school, and etc. So what I thought was that my mom cares more about the car because she uses that to get to work, and working earns money, and money helps support the family. Although, I might be wrong, and there might be a different reason why. So, fast forwarding to the present time, my mom and my sister are the only ones that work in the family, but my sister doesnt provide for the family. So, a few weeks after the car crash, my moms “boyfriend” lives with us, and he has a car, and then my sister argued to my mom that she has to go to work and she needs a car, so my mom actually didnt get to buy another car for herself to replace her car my sister accidentally crashed, but bought my sister her own car with insurance. So then a few months later, my mom buys my brother his own car, so she switches using her boyfriend’s car and my brother’s car to go to work varying day to day. So, here's where the question weighs in that I’m curious about. Okay, so my sister is an extrovert, she likes to party, hang out with her friends, and etc., she does pay for her own phone bill and her car, but she’s also the type of person who once she gets paid, she spends it right away on food, clothes, gas, unnecessary stuff like alcohol or parties or like going out, and bills sometimes, which is fine, but that's also the problem too. She parties every single night, goes out to hang out with her friends nearly everyday, and does practically whatever she wants, even disappearing for a few days without telling my mom (I'm also confused, if you live under your parent’s roof, don’t you still have to listen to their rules? My sister thinks that since she's an adult, she can do whatever she wants), and not listening to my mom to the point of ignoring everything my mom says or not showing respecting to her, like walking out of the house to party while my mom is speaking to her. I’ve also seen this countless times over the past year, where she asks my mom to pay for her bills like for her phone or car, because she didn't have any money left over from spending it on parties, or food, plus my sister got 2 speed tickets over the past few months so my mom had to pay for that too, because my sister didn’t have any money either, but the thing is, she tells me all the time that she pays for her own stuff, and she doesn't need my moms help, but she lies. Its true, but not entirely. The thing is, my family isn't rich, my mom doesn't have a lot of money, she practically pays for everything. I don’t know if anyone else does this, maybe this isn't taking advantage of. I’m not exactly sure what to call this, maybe I'm being biased, maybe what my sister is doing is just what you call youthfulness or living in the moment (shes a young adult by the way), but I’m just curious, which is worse though, caring more for material items over someone's life (my mom), or taking advantage of someone (my sister)? I really need some outside thoughts to clear up this question, because I’m not an extrovert like my sister, and I'm not a mom either, so I can't exactly relate to them. Sorry this was super long, and jumbled up, but please help me shed light on these situations, and if you can think of a better way to reword the question, you can also write that too!
did you find the ending of the novel 1984 depressing	how do winston and julia differ in the novel 1984 how are they similar	0	YES, Hugely.Not only does the novel end with an impending murder of the protagonist but it turns out our “hero” dies without a single rebellious thought.The whole novel revolves around Winston’s “thoughtcrimes” and we are made to feel for his isolation precisely for that reason. We are heavily invested in Winston’s seditious thoughts and we (can’t speak for everyone but I surely did) want him to break free of the party’s control however insignificant that be. Even up to the very end when Winston betrays Julia we are allowed a little hope that Winston still intends to be rebellious (his resolve to hate the party moments before his death).We know he is broken and the party has effectively won but author still gives us hope of that. Turns out he quashes it at the final line of the novel. Perhaps it was deliberate and apt but it was surely depressing. “I love Big Brother” must be the most depressing ending in a fiction.	"Winston is the intellectual. He thinks of how the rule of the Party might actually be ended, even though he doesn't expect it to happen in his lifetime.Julia is practical. She knows how to arrange meetings so that she and her chosen lover can have their trysts. She hates the Party and is in that respect similar to Winston, but she really just evades it. Its rule actually ending is beyond her mental horizon. It is said in the novel that she couldn't conceive of something like an independent political movement. Younger than Winston, she has grown up in the world of the Party and can't imagine anything else.Whenever Winston tries to talk ""politics"" with Julia, she gets bored and impatient. It happens over and over again. She is not a deep thinker; she is in it for the sex and for the thrill. She even falls asleep when he reads aloud Goldstein's forbidden book, which explains the true mechanics and ideology of the society created by the Party. Then again, Julia perhaps could have survived longer than Winston. We eventually learn that the Thought Police had had its eyes on Winston for at least seven years, O'Brien awaiting the perfect moment to bring him to the Ministry of Love and ""cure"" him. It is possible (though unconfirmed) that Julia, with all her cunning, had never been detected -- before she decided to romantically approach a man who was already under the surveillance of the Thought Police.

Gravity LightYes this is the light that doesn't require any type of hydro electricity energy or solar energy to glow. It simply runs from gravitational energy.GravityLight is powered by the lift of a weight.As the weight falls it turns a gear train, driving the motor that powers the LEDs.GravityLight doesn't need batteries or sunlight and costs nothing to run. It takes seconds to lift the weight that powers GravityLight, creating 20 minutes of light on its descent.Fill the bag with weight (about 12kg)Lift the bag using the orange cordBag falls slowly creating light (about 20 mins)When the bag reaches the ground it can be lifted again.[1]Some researchers even say that Gravitational energy can power the whole world if resources are utilized properly.Aabishkar WagleFootnotes[1] What We Do

what is the difference between a neutral state and a buffer state	if every state of the america declared war against each other which would win	0	"A buffer state is essentially a territory from which two or more nations or governments involved in political strife or armed conflicts benefit from because it separates their borders. All buffer states are neutral in the sense that they do not give political or military support to either neighbour. They may or may not be allied with other nations which have no interest in that particular territory.However, a permanently neutral state is bound by international law from the Geneva Convention, recognised by all other nations, and is restricted from becoming a belligerent unless it is attacked by a hostile party. Note that, other states can claim to be neutral but is actually supporting another nation by not doing anything.Switzerland during two consecutive World Wars is both a buffer and a neutral state. It is a permanently neutral state recognised by the Geneva Convention.​​​Although Switzerland's neighbours are frequently involved in political scuffles or standoffs which eventually blew up into World War I and II, invading Switzerland to cross into France was not a practical option for the Germans or Italians becauseSwitzerlands harsh terrains prevent a quick military victory, andAll able-bodied Swiss males are armed and has received military training.So instead of slogging through Swiss men armed to the teeth, Switzerland is left alone to function as a buffer state to take the pressure off Germany and France's borders.Examples of neutral states which are not buffer states areMaltaCosta RicaAndorraVatican CityMalta and the Vatican benefit from Italian protection while Costa Rica's military was dissolved in 1949. Andorra is co-ruled by two ""Co-Princes"" since the time of Emperor Charlemagne - one of them is the head of state of France (used to be French King, position now held by the President) and the Bishop of Urgell.Another example of a buffer is Thailand, separating British Malaya and the Dutch East Indies (now Indonesia). Bitter from the Anglo-Dutch Wars, neither colonial power wanted to invade and occupy Thailand."	Kentucky.It is well known that Kentucky has the finest horses in America. We will simply sweep down from the foothills of the Appalachians and cut a terrifying swath across Ohio and Indiana before we put Chicago to the torch and the sword. From there we shall commandeer their lake fleet, do a surprise crossing to Michigan (evading the forces amassed in a ring outside Chicago, thinking us trapped), and circle back through the Upper Peninsula to take Madison and Minneapolis. This gives us the headwaters of the Mississippi. We will simply repatriate the conquered Upper Peninsula to Canada and then, reinforced by lusty volunteers from the steppes of Sasketchewan, we will construct giant wooden barges and sail down the Mississippi, establishing garrisons near Cairo and the headwaters of the Missouri. Captive Missourians and Kansans will be forced to work in a massive earthworks project while our Canadian Hessians hold the borders, and we will change the course of the Mississippi.No one will see this coming.Now that Vicksburg and New Orleans have been reduced to strategic irrelevancy and the nation has been cleft in twain, our rampaging horde strikes across the plains of Kansas and Oklahoma, leaving a trail of smoke and ruin two leagues wide at its thinnest point, until we reach Wichita Falls. By this point the redirected Mississippi should be causing subsidence earthquakes all up and down the center third of America (indeed, ringing church bells as far away as Boston), and the superstitious Texans will be easily cowed.We shall teach the I-35 Corridor the meaning of fear, and the mileposts will be replaced with human heads. Walls of flame will spring up wherever the earth trembles at our step, from Dallas to Waco, as those with the courage join us and the rest die. Panicked villagers will flee to the east, where they will drown in the new Mississippi, and the west, where they are picked off by the resurgent and rearmed Comanche. Our conquering horde will pause in Austin to make a sacred pilgrimage to Enchanted Rock, the holy place where Conan the Barbarian was born, and then, inspired, we shall carve a bloody scar across the face of Texas from San Antonio to El Paso. Once we control Eagle Pass and the Rio Grande, we have essentially split America in half and joined Canada to Mexico. Tightening our grip, we shall institute our policy of retributive terror against our captive cities, particularly Dallas.We shall make an example of Dallas.There will be a pile of fresh skulls stacked before every McDonalds playscape in the DFW area.We will also switch over to the Amero and ban prayer in public schools.Now that we have tightened our iron grip across the soft midsection of these (formerly) United States, our most pressing needs are bows and arrows. The rampage across the Grain States garnered us more than enough geese and ducks for proper fletching, but the hard wood that we require for shafts and bows is difficult to find anywhere in the areas we control (except for the Upper Peninsula, which we shortsightedly gave to the Canadians). Our only choice will be to lunge across Roswell and Carlsbad, filling those famous caverns with blood, and then feint around Albequerque. They will assume we are going for Los Alamos, but our real targets are the forests of northwestern New Mexico. Once we have installed ourselves in our ancient seats of power in the Anasazi homelands we will be unstoppable. Death shall be our servant, fire our only friend.At this point the weaker-willed states such as Utah and Alabama will flock to our banner, and of course Tennessee and West Virginia were rooting for us all along. New Jersey will join us after a daring diplomatic mission in which I parachute into Parsippany and promise Governor Christie the repatriation of Ellis Island, Liberty Island, and Staten Island if they will join us in the fight. He will of course accept, because that guy knows a good thing when he sees it, and will provide us with a legion of Camden Irregulars and a group of volunteer kommisars from Northern New Jersey. Treachery will grant us West Point (my granddad used to work there, I know people) and a simple pincer movement will isolate Manhattan Island from Long Island, cutting Fort Tryon off from their supplies and forcing New York City to, finally, capitulate to New Jersey. New Jersey will find our victory sweet, and reward us with many big-haired beauties.Now the American government has been drawn and quartered by our rampaging horde. We hold absolute dominion over a third of the nation, and the remaining third is in complete chaos, unable to provide social services or even guarantee the safety of their citizens after night falls. In fear the Army will withdraw, protecting themselves instead of the civilian centers. Now is the moment. In the dread silence of the terror we have sown we shall mount a simultaneous offensive on Washington D.C. from our West Virginian lair and send our rested and replenished Kentuckian forces trampling up the edge of the Rockies into the stony citadels of Colorado Springs. The tall timbers of the Sangre de Cristo Mountains shall form our catapults and trebuchets, and the very same red rocks of which Denver is so proud shall rain down upon their heads. They cannot resist us, for God is on our side.At this point the American government will be reduced to the Central Valley of California, which, to be fair, is totally self sufficient and could hold out against us for decades. So we'll give them cholera.

what is the greatest mystery in the universe	what is the greatest mystery of all time	0	“All Officers, including the Captain, are dead. Lying in chart room and bridge. Possibly whole crew dead. … I die.”This was the radio message received by some ships in Straits of Malacca[1] in 1947–48. Some Morse codes were also there which couldn’t be deciphered.S.S. OURANG MEDAN, the ghost ship.The coordinates of the ship was calculated by the message, and was sent to the nearest ship, the SILVER STAR.Captain of the SILVER STAR wasted no time, and within few hours they found the OURANG MEDAN.They tried to contact the crew members of the ship, but there was no response, so they decided to board the OURANG MEDAN.As soon as they boarded the ship, they saw the most horrific thing.The deck of the ship was filled with dead bodies[2] .The Captain’s body was there on the bridge. Bridge Officers bodies were there in the chart room. The Radio Operator, who sent the message, was found at his station[3] .Even the dogs on the ship were dead.There was something unusual.Every face had the same expression.Eyes wide-opened with fear, and twisted face because of terror.The rescue members noticed something strange.The temperature was more than 100°F, but it was cold inside the ship.There were no signs of injuries on the bodies.The bodies were decaying faster than they should be.So, they decided to tow the ship to the port.But as they attached the tow line to the OURANG MEDAN, smoke started coming out of it.So they cut the tow line, and quickly boarded the SILVER STAR.As soon as they boarded, the OURANG MEDAN exploded and soon disappeared beneath the water.And with the ship, the biggest mystery went inside.Some claimed that it was a ghost ship[4] .Some claimed that the ship didn’t even exist.Some claimed that the ship was carrying some biological weapons, which went horribly wrong.Some claimed that the ship was attacked by some UFO.Was it a real, or just a sea tale?No one knows.One of the greatest mysteries of all time, the OURANG MEDAN…1st image source:- S.S.

what is the alternative to machine learning	how do i oversample a multiclass imbalance data set	0	"I think the alternative to Machine Learning is directly embedding intuitions into computer programs. Machine Learning is all about learning from data. But you can still get a lot done and come up with a good solution if you give yourself time to tinker with your program. Unfortunately there is no recipe for building great programs this way. If you do attack a problem the non-ML way, you'll need lots of domain expertise and lots if time. The problem with tinkering with your program directly (adding custom if-s and custom for-loops), is that on many real-world problems you won't get very far with at least some machine learning. Object recognition folks used to write software comprising hand-written rules such as ""if edge is located above another edge, then output building"" but such programs didn't generalize to novel pictures very well. In my opinion it is very difficult to perform object recognition without a data set, and some learning component.Machine Learning is here to stay, but it doesn't mean everything in your programs will be learned from data. I think a better question is: how much machine learning should I be doing to solve problem X?With this new question in mind, the answer is almost always going to be a combination of being a smart and creative programmer half the time and a good data-scientist the other half."	Sorry I clicked the button too soon since it is my first post here…the situation is like this: 8 classes, 4 groups, each group has very imbalanced data sets, some might be even missing one class, is it possible for me to try any oversampling method? I tried SMOTE in python for each group, what it does is just match the class with fewest amount (not the missing one, if there is any) to the class with largest amount.
why does china block sanctions at the un against the jaishemohammad jem chief masood azhar	why does china support masood azhar	1	Masood Azhar is a terrorist. End of debate.His organisation, JeM, if I'm not wrong, has already been blacklisted by the UN.In international relations and geopolitics, nobody cares who's right. Everybody only cares who's strong.If you are strong, you can absolutely do anything a still get away with it.Every single war of US after WW2 has been a farce. Does anyone dare say anything? Nope. If some biggie (India, UK) says anything, there's gonna be major diplomatic fallout. If some weak nation says anything, (Syria, Iraq, Algeria) then they better get prepared for war cuz they're gonna be bombed day in and out after the statement. The pretext will of course be 'War on Terror'.China is an expanisonist nation. They consider Taiwan, Tibet, CoK, Arunachal etc. all part of China. They are total back-stabbers and are the least loyal country in the world. All they want is to become the big daddy of the world.US is already the big daddy of the world and so that puts both of them into direct conflict. China will do anything to achieve superpower status and treats everyone as use-and-throw.Pakistan is the ultimate use and throw country of the world. US exploited Pak very well to push back the Soviets. Soviets are extinct, so now Pak is quite useless to US.Now, what US wants is to prevent China from becoming powerful. The only way they can prevent it is by supporting India. So now India is US's use and throw country. They know India is like the innocent kid, hell bent on helping everyone.Now, this puts China and India directly into conflict. Already, we have lots of disputes with China about water sharing, boundaries, etc. India being US's pawn is a major irritant for China.So what should they do? Well they know Pak is dumb and can be exploited very easily and as it is it has fallen out of favor with US, so Pak would love to lick their feet. Off they go to convince Pak. Pak accepts the proposal in return for China acting against India's interests.So that is why, China is rejecting India's candidature for NSG, UNSC and Masood's blacklisting. China very much knows India has become too strong for a war, so they are using their soft power. They are bribing nations with their line of credits and in return are getting support for they do and silence when they do something wrong.It's a big game of Chess which is being played here in South Asia. India-China relations will be what defines 21st century. India needs to stand up on its own and stop being reliant on other countries. As soon as each country achieves its objectives, they are gonna dump India.Everyone will provide India with enough support to keep China bogged down. But no one will ever provide India so much of support that Pakistani problem gets solved and China is defeated. This is because if India becomes more powerful than China, it means again India will be in direct conflict with Russia and US for the status of superpower.Russia made India pay extra for their defence equipments and forced India to buy only their equipments in exchange for their support and veto powers. So don't think Russia is our 'all weather ally'. Just see Russia and Pakistan's bonhomie.Conclusion:China is using its soft power to act against India's interests as Pakistan requested them to, in exchange for influence and furtherance of their objectives all over Asia through CPEC and Gwadar, both of which pass through Pakistan.Thank you for reading my answer !If you like my answer or style, do hit the upvote button and follow for more of such answers.I hope we meet again........Yours sincerely,The Aerospace Maven	Masood Azhar is a terrorist.

can excessive amounts of vitamin c cause me to have a miscarriage	how can vitamin c cause a miscarriage	1	Women who do use Vitamin C in the early days as one of their natural miscarriage methods need to consume one pill, of 500 mg every hour, for a period of 4 to 10 days. At times, women are asked to get up a few times in the middle of the night just to take the required number of pills during the night. While it is not a given that Vitamin C will lead to a miscarriage, taking this vitamin may just make it easier for a woman to miscarry. This is because Vitamin C has the ability to weaken the bond between the wall of the uterus and the egg. However, in order to induce a miscarriage with Vitamin C a woman will need to consume certain types of Vitamin C pills, as the foods that are high in Vitamin C do not contain the required doses. The ascorbic acid that is present in Vitamin C could cause a woman to miscarry, but most of the brands of Vitamin C tablets contain bioflavoids and other substances, which counter the effect of the ascorbic acid on the body. Tablets that do not contain bioflavoids usually do not have the required amount of ascorbic acid to induce a miscarriage in a person. Moreover, the Vitamin C pills will need to be taken in the early stages of pregnancy, for them to have any effect. This is because once the woman is past the 4th week of gestation, the bond between the egg and the walls of the uterus are too strong to be broken by Vitamin C.It is believed that after 4 weeks of gestation, Vitamin C will not lead to a miscarriage, but will reduce the supply of blood, oxygen and nutrients to the baby, which will result in baby with low birth weight, a disabled child or a child that is mentally stunted. This is one of the main reasons that most health experts strongly urge women to avoid using any home remedies for an abortion. Moreover, such practices are extremely dangerous and could have a seriously adverse effect on the woman's body. The damage caused by Vitamin C pills taken for an abortion could also be permanent not just for the mother, but also the child. Based on the woman's health condition and medical history, in some rare cases, consuming Vitamin C pills could also be fatal. Women who have any problems that are related to their kidneys should not use even try to induce miscarriage with Vitamin C. This is because a high level of ascorbic acid has can have a bad effect on the kidneys and could lead to kidney stones and other kidney related problems. Women, who take high doses if Vitamin C, generally suffer from copper deficiency, as this Vitamin interferes with the body's intake of the mineral. Hence they may be required to take a copper supplement too. However, it is absolutely essential to consult a doctor before taking any medication or vitamin.

how do i access torbox in india	how do i access googlecom from india	0	"I'm going to open with some background, but I'll get to instructions - pinkie swear.""Deep web"" is distinct from ""dark web"". The ""dark web"" is the encrypted network that exists between Tor servers and their clients, whereas the ""deep web"" is simply the content of databases and other web services that for one reason or another cannot be indexed by conventional search engines.Clearing Up Confusion - Deep Web vs. Dark WebHere be dragonsNeither the deep web nor the dark web can be indexed, but not all that cannot be indexed is the dark web. For purposes of this question, I assume you want the dark web - that much-hyped, mysterious place that the media would have you believe is a wretched hive of scum and villainy where you'd be well-served to shoot first if you hope to survive. Activists will tell you it's our last, best hope for privacy and free speech, all alone in the night.As with most things, the truth falls somewhere in between. But you didn't come here for analysis, you came here for instructions. Fair enough.First of all, if you want anyone who matters to take you seriously, drop the ""dark/deep web"" thing. What you want to access are sites using the Tor Hidden Service Protocol. It works over regular Tor (anonymity network), but instead of having your traffic routed from your computer and through an onion-like layer of servers, it stays within the Tor network. You won't know exactly what system you're accessing unless they tell you, and they won't know who you are unless they do - or unless one of you is careless.But given that you're the one starting out and they're the ones running hidden services, they kind of have you at a disadvantage if you screw up. Fortunately, the tales of people having their lives ruined by browsing the wrong sites and being hunted by mafiosi bent on silencing them for having witnessed a mob hit inexplicably streamed online are massively overblown. At most, you might find yourself mercilessly trolled, get pizzas ordered to your door, or if you're particularly unfortunate, get Swatted.‘Swatting’ Prank Ends Horribly for Victim — and He Has the Injury to Prove ItThe simplest way to start using Tor is to download the Tor browser bundle (assuming you're on Windows). You can get it at: Tor Browser. You can find installation instructions for Tor on other operating systems on the same page.Once it's installed and launched, the browser should connect automatically to the Tor network. From there, you can use a directory of certain hidden services to get started. Some of these directories include:Hidden Wiki | Tor .onion urls directoriesHiddenWiki Deep Web LinksThe uncensored hidden wiki is up: http://kpvz7kpmcmne52qf.onion/wiki/index.php/Main_Page • /r/TORThese sites may contain links to illegal services and are provided for informational purposes only.

how do i register my domain site email	how do you register a an domain	0	Google Apps for Work – Gmail, Drive, Docs and More is one of the better options if you also have an Android device like a tablet or mobile phone. But it works fine with iOS too, but Android and Google Apps are very closely connected. The drawback? It costs about €4 per month. Roughly the same in US dollars.But first you would have to register your domain name if you haven’t done that yet. And you will need a registrar who will allow you to change your own DNS settings and which will register the domain in your name and not theirs. This means that free registrars aren’t an option and registering a domain can cost about €5 to €15 per year for the more common extensions like COM, ORG and NET. Other extensions might be even more expensive.So, you already have costs for your domain name. And Google Apps provides you much more than just email. They provide you an online calendar and contact list, plus lots of online storage for backups. This is basically a version of GMail on your own domain.It also allows you to create an unlimited amount of email aliases by setting up a catch-all account. Plus, you have Google Groups connected to your domain too, allowing you to set up various mailing lists with whatever name you like, which you could use as an alternative mailbox.You will need some experimenting and learning to use it properly, though.	Currently this is not possible to register this domain. .an was the Internet country code top-level domain (ccTLD) for the former Netherlands Antilles. It was administered by the University of the Netherlands Antilles. The domain was phased out after the Netherlands Antilles were dissolved in 2010.

is it normal for older men to be attracted to young women	why am i attracted to older men	0	"Very much so. And unfortunately, to even younger girls.While a teen I've been vaguely aware of it mainly from second/ third hand sources. But I was pretty sheltered, and didn't venture much beyond school activities with my peers, so hardly experienced it personally.When I was a grad student I was shocked to see how common and intense was the attraction of older men towards girls. I know that many people on Quora stress that young females are women, but I'm referring here to underage girls (many 15 -17) who looked their age. (And for those who were wondering how the girls were dressed - very ""plainly"", these were students from low-income rural families who couldn't afford stylish clothing.)During the Summer I used to work for a program for high school kids who spent several weeks on the campus. As a part of the program we took them to visit various industries, etc. When we were out and about, I saw how grown men of all ages STARED their eyes out at the girls. In fact, it was so pervasive that it was my most disturbing recollection of working for the program. When the students got all dressed up and did their final presentations, I happened to sit at the back of the auditorium and saw some of the male instructors also staring out at the females. Once when we were in a hotel dining room I saw a male in his 30's, who was there with his wife, a small infant and an older couple (his or her parents) stare ACROSS the room at the girls who were in plain white Walmart T-shirts, with wet hair from the swimming pool. And I'm by no means referring to quick, appreciative ""ain't she cute""  glances. These were prolonged, leering, predatory stares.And the strange thing I noticed was that the teen boys in the program behaved much, much more circumspectly towards the girls. For all the talk of testosterone driven young males, I didn't notice, or hear of, anything remotely comparable in my several years of working for the program. (And I interacted with the students a lot outside the classroom - in their residence halls, on trips out of town, etc. Because most of the students were minors the staff were required to keep a close watch on them at all times.)"	15 Reasons Why Women Love Older Men.The level of maturity older men portray is difficult to findThere's absolutely no denying that a man who is older than you is definitely more mature than the one who is either your age, or younger. And thank god for that! Because honestly, dealing with immature guys is like taking care of a man child, and no woman's got time for that.They're so much more settled in lifeAn established man with a sorted career is what you need. Because A - He will never be jealous of what you do and the career choices you make, because he's been there. And, B - He'll actually help and encourage you to make the move you've been dreading. Absolutely no insecurities there.Their years of experience makes them a better loverAhem ahem, you know what I'm talking about. Now older men know exactly what to do and how to do it. They'll make sure that you have a good time, they'll respect your choices and will not finish soon before you're done.Deeper understandingThere's no denying that a man with maturity in age and thoughts will be able to match your wavelength much better. The older man will let you do the things you want to and will encourage you to maintain your individuality.Their attractiveness is beyond comparisonJust like we said earlier, it's hard not to look twice and ogle at the brilliance of a matured man, especially if he has the whole silver fox thingy going on for himYour conversations will be of this world and beyondSince your man is older, he's seen the world and more people than you have. And he knows how to carry on a conversation - from gossiping to talking about politics, to the workings of the world and the plans he has for the two of you, this man can talk about everything and anything under the sun.Emotional stabilityIf you're dating an older man, then you're all in with your feelings already. Because man, this guy has some magnetic charm that makes you feel safe around them. And you don't have a care in the world when you're with them because no matter what, you know both of you will figure it out.They're still in touch with their inner childNo matter how old they might get, their hearts will always be young. Their inner child will keep things surprising and spontaneous, and they'll win your heart everyday.
what is the strongest structure or strongest shape under compression	what is the strongest kevlar cord	0	In engineering the strongest structures  may be regarded as those that obtain a high degree of strength from a  minimal amount of material, being efficient structures, lightweight, and  as strong as their geometries could allow given the various contexts.  There is no single strongest structure, as there are many different  types of strength. Some truss like structures present the optimum  geometries for resisting cantilever stresses as you mentioned, remaining rigid by  reducing bending moments, resisting deformation under a combination of  compression, tension and shear. Other structures present the most  efficient geometry for resisting purely compressive stresses,  distributing loads efficiently with the shortest paths to minimize  lateral buckling. It seems this is what you're after but it's not quite so simple. Still others represent the strongest geometries for  resisting purely tension, carrying the force in a direct route so as not  to amplify the stress.Also there are singular shapes which hold their form in circumstances  where pressures are exerted at different points, i.e. catenary curves  and catenary domes, spherical domes, and pyramids and triangles.Before the strongest structure for a particular circumstance can be  established, it is necessary to determine the kinds of stresses the  structure must resist.TensionThe most efficient geometry for carrying solely tensile stress is a  straight line parallel with the direction of the force, such a steel  cable. These are extensively used in suspension bridges, which are  popular as tension elements typically require significantly less  material than compression elements which must resist buckling. If a  cable were to branch out at various angles, the stress carried by the  original cable would be amplified.Far more complicated geometries arise when loads are carried on a cable  running perpendicularly to the direction of the force. The catenary  curve is the optimum geometry for carrying such loads if they are  uniform at all points, both in compression and in tension.  Also when such loads must be carried at various angles, over a large  sheet or mesh, the optimum geometry becomes very complex. Frei Otto did  pioneering work with soap bubble films, which spread between points to  find the minimum possible surface area, and when the geometry is  translated into a tension structure, the least amount of material may be  used to cover a specific area.CantileverThe strongest known truss for resisting tension and compression is an  octet-truss, but only in terms of a repeating isotropic geometry, and  this structure is used extensively with cantilever and long spanning  roof applications. The structure is composed of a repeating tessellation  of octahedrons and tetrahedrons, which are made up of triangular faces.  The triangle is the best shape for remaining rigid as it does not give  in to geometric distortion without changing the length of one of its  edges; in contrast to squares which may be easily distorted into various  parallelograms. The triangle does the best job of minimizing bending  momentsCompressionThe strongest known truss structure for resisting compression with an isotropic geometry is a  lorimerlite framework, however only in terms of a repeating geometry  (isotropic). This structure reduces the danger of lateral buckling as  each beam finds the shortest unbraced path within the structure. Also  loads are distributed evenly at each tetrahedral joint.A tessellation of hexagons is the strongest isotropic geometry when considering only two dimensions.Frei Otto, again, did some pioneering work with tree like branching  structures. A thick column would branch into more slender beams, into  again more slender beams, which would concentrate compressive forces  into the central column with each beam resisting buckling due to their  short individual lengths. This kind of tree like branching structure  represents the optimum, anisotropic, structural geometry.Read more:  What is the strongest shape for a structure?? | Answerbag What is the strongest shape for a structure??

are exocytosis and endocytosis examples of active or passive transport	what are examples of passive transport in cells	0	Expanding just a little on Emily's answer, they are active transport because they are metabolic processes, requiring energy inputs, and susceptible to physiological control. Passive transport would be diffusion, such as gaseous exchange of CO2 and O2 in the alveoli, for instance.	There are three types of passive transport:Diffusion:Solutes travel along their concentration gradient from areas of higher concentration to lower concentration. Regarding diffusion, the solutes are able to tranverse the semipermeable cellular membrane. These are usually smaller, non-polar, and uncharged molecules, molecules that easily pass through the phospholipid bilayer.Ex. A high concentration of oxygen outside the cell relative to inside the cell will lead to the diffusion of oxygen from outside to inside the cell.OsmosisWater travels from areas with a lower solute concentration to areas with a higher solute concentration.Ex. If you were to drink a lot of salt water, water would flow out of your cells so that both solutions in and outside of your cells were isotonic since the salt water would have a lot of salt in comparison to the intracellular environment. This is also why it is dangerous to drink a lot if salt water.Facilitated DiffusionProtein channels or carrier proteins, still not requiring any energy as it’s still along a solute’s concentration gradient, assist/facilitate the diffusion of a solute from areas of higher concentration to lower concentration. This would occur with molecules that are larger, polar, and/or charged, molecules that do not easily pass through the phospholipid bilayer.Ex. Aquaporin protein facilitates the transport of water in and out of the cell.Key things about passive transport:-it’s always along the solute’s concentration gradient (regarding osmosis, this means water travels to the area of higher concentration to dilute it and reduce the concentration)-it’s always spontaneous/does not require energy

what is the ideal life after retirement	what  life after retirement	0	Spotalpha's Alpha builder tools provide trend signals[1] of stocks, ETFs and indices listed in US and India.Here's a snapshot of the latest performance of trend signals on 30 sy...	Efrain Martinez ‏@martefrain_: it seems like ever since ur born lifes all about working getting promotion etc But whats life after retirement? It seems lifelessAnswerI was retired when I was three years old. All I had to do all day was shit in my pants and play with my friends, often at the same time. My friends were disgusted with me when that happened and my mother had to comfort me. Other things I remember about  my “retirement”: whenever the full moon was out it meant the Bat Signal was ON. Sesame Street had some good moments. I always wanted to try spinach because Popeye ate spinach but I HATED the taste. A special treat in my retirement was when my mom would play JUST ONE MORE game of checkers with me.On other days I would play with my friends. One time I accidentally broke the door of one friend’s house. Another time I drew all over a friend’s window. Both instances I denied to my parents when their parents inevitably called mine to punish me. Retirement was great. It was creative. I was master of my universe.And then it all ended. One day I woke up and I was told I had to go to something called “nursery school”. When is it over? I wanted to know. I wanted my retirement back.My dad explained it to me:Well first you go to nursery school for two years, then kindergarten, then 12 years of school, then 4 years of college, then probably another 4 years of graduate school, then you work for 40 years, then when you are as old as grandpa, you’ll be retired and you can do whatever you want.WHAT!!!!Oh god. And then I went to school and everyone hated me (that thing about shitting in your pants while lying on top of a group of kids just didn’t work very well in a social environment). And then in grade school it didn’t work (peeing in your pants doesn’t work either). And then college didn’t work (homework? tests? a girlfriend who was throwing food at me whenever she got angry, which was every day, and grad school didn’t work (I got thrown out)). Then jobs didn’t work. I was always trying to do something on the side (write a novel, start a business). I wasn’t very good at corporate politics. Later, when I had more flexible jobs I would disappear for months at a time (CEO to me: “Jim Cramer wants to know why you are never here”) or I would just disappear completely (in the middle of a meeting, walking out of the building, never coming back).(maybe the house Claudia and I will move to when we retire)“Work” is just a tiny subset of the life around you. You do it to live. You do it when you have to. All other times it should be avoided. You’re in the Matrix but you don’t realize it. Bit by bit you can plan your escape.“But what if I have no money?” you might say. Good question. EVERYONE has skills to develop multiple streams of income on their own. Make sure you are healthy. Make sure you are coming up with ideas nonstop and your idea muscle is healthy. Be around supportive people. Give yourself a five year time period to break free. And then start dipping your feet in the River of Change. Once you are immersed from toe to head, you will feel as if you are suffocating for air. But you will find an ocean of life swimming around you. You’ll swim off the island, into the current, and sometimes those currents will be rough, will throw you around, will make you feel like you are going to die, crashing into the rocks. But you will never swim back to that little island. The entire world needs  to be explored.That is your “retirement”. It can start right now and it will never be boring and it will never end.Note: I answer this and similar questions in http://www.jamesaltucher.com/cat...
what is our stance against pakistan	what is the stance of pakistan in the possession of weapons of mass destruction by north korea does it support dprk or is it against dprk	0	We can’t declare war with pakistan.I've seen many people talking that India can beat Pakistan in war because we have more military forces, more fighter jets and one of the most strongest navy in the world.But war is a not a good idea. If we will declare war with Pakistan, we all are gonna lose our great economy and soldiers of our nation.It’s true we can defeat pakistan but what will happen next?Let’s see some most probable situations that we have to go through if we declare war with Pakistan.1.War can change to nuclear war anytime.And nuclear war is not something we can win without a huge damage.A nuclear war will probably ruin the soil for more that 400 years.A loss of huge amount of human and animal population.Loss of major infrastructure and buildings.A huge amout of carbon will cover up the sky.Inshort, environment and economy will be completely destroyed.2. Lets assume the world somehow manages to stop Pakistan for not using nuclear weapons.Even if we declare war and we win it and luckily no nuclear weapons were used.What we get?Downfall of Indian economy and death of millions of soldiers.And will it stop terrorism?I mean without a government Pakistan will become a good place for terrorist. Who knows how bad it will become?A true leader dont do what people tells him, he does what is good for his nation.Jai hind.	Pakistan is fully involved in giving NK the technology of enriching of uranium to bomb grade material. Paki scientist AQ Khan made many trips to NK for this. In return, NK gave Pak the technology to make long-range Nudong-type missiles. The military relations between NK & Pak are old & deep.

If you want to keep it simple, keep to Joel Furhman M.D.’s checklist:1. Eat a large green salad as your main dish at least once a day, with a healthy dressing. (My comment: Google “nut-based dressings,” or do what I do: add sliced apple, raisins, walnuts, pecans or some combination of these.)2. Eat around two ounces of nuts and seeds a day. Include walnuts and ground flax seed.3. Eat some beans every day, in a soup, chili or burger. (My comment: Or take a corn tortilla and add refried beans, corn and salsa.)4. Eat a large serving of cooked green vegetables every day. (I find if I microwave any green veggie and add either seasonings or a splash of Trader Joe’s balsmaic-vinegar glaze and French’s mustard, it takes great. Or I add pasta sauce. And every day I cook chopped onions in a few tablespoons of water until soft and then add a chopped veggie, such as bok choy and chopped mushrooms, perhaps with a splash of soy sauce.)5. Eat fresh fruit with each meal. (Especially berries!)Here’s Joel Furhman, M.D.’s more specific advice for athetes:“More and more professional athletes from a wide range of sports have adopted a Nutritarian style of eating. They are not all vegan Nutritarians, but they have sworn off processed foods, minimized animal products and are eating lots of veggies, beans, nuts and seeds.NFL defensive lineman David Carter, also known as “the 300 pound vegan,” made news with his diet of whole plant foods. In a recent article in GQ, Carter described what he eats in a typical day: several smoothies made from greens, berries, beans and sunflower seeds; whole grains, beans, nuts, avocado and salad. He also noted that the joint pain he attributed to his football career disappeared after he changed his diet.1He reports he is quicker, has better stamina and actually got stronger.Powerlifter Nathaniel Jordan follows a vegan Nutritarian diet. High-nutrient plant foods fuel his strength. Weighing 165 pounds, with about 5 percent body fat, Nathaniel can bench press 275 pounds, squat 445 pounds and deadlift 600 pounds—and counting. Previously, overweight, his Nutritarian diet enabled him to not only become one of the strongest pound–for–pound athletes in the world, but also to lose 90 pounds of body fat.These stories of Nutritarian professional athletes are beginning to break stereotypes and correct misconceptions about strength and athletic performance. For an athlete in a sport that demands a large body size, maximizing performance without compromising health and longevity is a challenge.Old myths about what to eat to maintain a strong, muscular body and support high levels of physical activity keep many athletes from improving the nutritional quality of their diet. As a result, they continue to rely on calorie-rich, nutrient-poor foods that promote bulk but do not promote health.Training triggers muscle building and dietary protein provides the raw materials that muscles need to grow stronger. Large athletes must meet large calorie and protein needs, but meat, milk, eggs and whey protein shakes are unnecessary.Nutrient dense plant rich foods for the athleteConsider the protein content of a meal of beans, a whole grain (here, quinoa) and green vegetables, topped with a cream sauce made from nuts and seeds:1.5 cups red kidney beans, cooked 22 grams of protein, 340 calories1 cup quinoa, cooked, 8 grams of protein, 220 calories1 ounce Mediterranean pine nuts, 10 grams of protein, 160 calories.2 ounces hemp seeds, 20 grams of protein, 320 calories.2 cups broccoli, cooked, 12 grams of protein, 105 calories.1 cup spinach, cooked, 5 grams of protein, 40 calories.Total: 77 grams of protein, 1,185 caloriesMediterranean pine nuts and hemp seeds are high-protein, calorie-dense foods great for muscle building without the drawbacks of animal products.

does a black hole have mass	does a black hole have a finite mass	1	Yes.Mass is one of the three distinguishing traits a black hole can have (the other two are angular momentum and electric charge).I should note however that this mass doesn’t really represent a specific ‘amount’ of matter that makes up the black hole. A black hole is actually a region of space-time, so the mass manifests in the structure of the space-time itself. This means it is possible to measure different masses for a black hole depending on how you define mass. A black hole isn’t a material body where you can count the number of particles that make it up or anything like that.

is morgan freeman correct when he says the only way to stop racism is to stop talking about it	what are your views about this morgan freeman quote about racism	1	No.  Morgan Freeman is affirming the concept of colorblindness to deal with inter personal, intra personal, structural and systemic racism.  While one might  think that if we didn't talk about race, the attention to it would go away, the truth is we've tried that and it doesn't work. That's HUA thinking.  White people have made talking about race socially unacceptable. This hasn't worked  in addressing policies that impact Black people and other people of color. In-the-closet may work for a poorly designed suit, but it doesn't work for policies (legislative and educational and others) that affect Black people and other people of color.  The policies are real, the issues are real and they need to be unpacked and talked about, by adults who know the meaning of the word dialogue. So ditch the Kum-ba-yah approach and lets just listen to one another and ask decent questions that move the conversation forward.Colorblindness  contextually erases my existence in this country. You can't take away the historical context of a person's existence and expect to have a whole person. Your history is mandatory for me to learn and mine is an elective?  It doesn't work that way. Let's move toward a learning about each other's histories and employ the education system in a meaningful way, and perhaps then we will see change.

how would you review the site waveclues	is there a good pay for reviews site out there	0	"I'll answer this question in 2 parts.1) You think it's a hypothetical question. It's not. Review My Online Date is a site that lets you read and submit ""reviews"" of the online daters, for the online daters.The Single Gals’ New App Of Choice: Lulu Lets You Review Guys You’ve DatedExRated is a Yelp for exes.There are probably more already released or in the work. So far only Lulu has gained some traction, but this might change soon.There are other sites that focus solely on real horror stories from bad dates. 2) now, onto how I would rate the last date I had.I think if you take it online - it's usually to vent or to rave - people who participate in surveys (with no real rewards) often only do it when they feel strongly about it after all. But on the other hand, if this was the norm - everyone does it, it's like Facebook, everyone leaves a comment and a star rating after the date - then it would be just one common task, and the reviews would include a wider range of emotions / judgements. Sorry if this doesn't really answer what you asked. That was how I read the question."	Why does the Quora Partner Program pay you to ask questions, rather than answer?If Quora paid for answers, how would that work?Suppose Dudley Poindexter with fourteen followers answered a question with a well-researched and nuanced piece, complete with references and footnotes. His answer gets a hundred views and ten upvotes.Meanwhile, Suzy Rottencrotch with her cute profile pic and five thousand followers writes a vapid opinion piece, replete with spelling errors and questionable logic. Her answer goes on to amass five thousand views and five hundred upvotes.Who gets paid?Suzy’s answer generated more ad impressions, but isn't worth the time it took to read it. Meanwhile, Dudley’s answer is barely a blip on anyone's radar. Quora wants to generate ad revenue, especially from outside Quora itself, but it understandably doesn't want to direct outside traffic from search engines to Suzy’s work. The site would lose credibility very quickly and would be operating at cross purposes to its stated mission.And what happens if twenty other people weigh in with their answers, some of which restate Dudley’s answer, some of which contain fundamental errors, and some of which are just trolling attempts?How do you determine who should get what? And what prevents people from churning out bullshit, repetitive answers in the hopes of making a few cents?We're already seeing that with some of the questions.All of this is ignoring a much larger, more salient point: There is no shortage of people willing to answer. There is a need for more good questions. The answers on Quora do not drive the traffic. Not the internal or the external. The questions do. Without the questions, there can be no answers.
in how many ways can we distribute 10 identical looking pencils to 4 students so that each student gets at least one pencil	in how many ways 12 apples can be distributed among 4 children such that every child gets at least 2 apples	0	we need to find the various groups of combinations of numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, ….10 which add up to 10 which include 4 combinations per group. The total number of such groups can be expressed as E = [(n - 1)!]{Σ1/[(j - 1)!][(n - j)!]}, where n = total number of identical items and j, the number of groups, each of which sums to n, = 1, 2, 3, …. → n. With regard to a response to this question, n =10 and j = 4. Therefore, E(j=4) = 9!/(3!)(6!) = 84 = number of ways 10 identical pencils can be distributed to 4 students such that each gets at least 1 pencil.Just for the sake of completeness, let’s consider those groups of 1, 2 and 3 combinations, summing to 10, which add to the ways of distribution of pencils to 4 students. For j = 1, E(j=1) = 9!/(0!)(9!)) =1. Arrangements to accommodate 4 students are 4!/3! = 4 per group and ways to distribute are thus (4!)(3!) =4. Similarly for J = 2, E(j=2) = 9!/(1!)(8!) = 9. Arrangements to suit 4 students are 4!/2! = 12 and ways to distribute to 4 students = (12)(9) = 108. Finally, for j = 3, E(j=3) = 9!/(2!)(7!) = 36. Arrangements to suit 4 students are (4!)/(1!) = 24 and ways to distribute to 4 students are (24)(36) = 864. Total of ways to distribute 10 identical pens to 4 students, without qualification regarding number of pencils to any student = 4+108+864+84 = 1060, which accounts for all groups of pencil combinations of 1, 2, 3, and 4, each of which sums to 10 pencils. Only 84 of these assure that each student receives at least 1 pencil. The remainder provide anywhere from 0 up to all 10 pencils per student.	Since, it is given that each of them should be given atleast 2 apples.Thus, firstly, give 2 to each of them (Assuming all apples are identical).Now, these 4 children have 2 apples each.Remaining 4 apples (12 initial–8 distributed) can be distributed to these with the condition that anyone of these can receive any number of apples ranging from 0 to 4, as they will always have atleast 2 with them as asked in the questions.Let us now see the possible groups -1. 4+0+0+0No. of ways = 4!/3! = 42. 3+1+0+0No. of ways = 4!/(2!) = 123. 2+2+0+0No. of ways = 4!/(2!)(2!) = 64. 2+1+1+0No. of ways = 4!/2! = 125. 1+1+1+1No. of ways = 4!/4! = 1So, the total no. of possible ways = 4+12+6+12+1= 35 Answer.For any queries, kindly comment. :)
how much would it cost to hire jerry seinfeld for 12 hours	how much on average would it cost to video tape a 2 hour presentation	0	There’s no fixed cost for car insurance. It depends on six factors:Let’s understand why and how:1. The value of your car· Insured Declared Value· Your insurance depends on your car’s value. It’s called the Insured Declared Value or IDV. You can opt to reduce this amount.· Sum assured· The IDV is the maximum amount the insurance company promises to pay during a claim.· IDV affects premium· This can affect your car insurance premium amount. The higher the IDV, the higher is your premium.· Don’t forget depreciation· Your car’s parts get old. So, when it comes to replacing or repairs, the insurance company takes this into account.Market value – Depreciation = Insurance payout· You can lower your IDV· This IDV is not fixed. You can opt for an insurance with a lower IDV. This can lower your premium cost.· But remember, this means you may have to pay from your pocket if the damages exceed the IDV.2. The type of car insuranceNot every insurance offers the same coverage. It depends on the type of insurance.There are three main kinds of insurance policies available for your car. They are as follows:1) Third-PartyThis is a bare-minimum policy. It covers only the damage caused to another person and his/her vehicle. It has the lowest premium.2) ComprehensiveThis policy covers all kinds of damages—to your car, another car, and the car driver.Damages include:· Collision· Theft· Fire· Sabotage· Natural occurrencesSince this type of insurance offers greater coverage than a third-party insurance, it costs more.Your basic comprehensive car insurance premium consists of:· Cost of third-party cover· Own damage cover cost· Personal Accident cover for the owner (Rs 100)· Service tax of 15%**May change over time.3) Zero DepreciationThis is an Add-on to a Comprehensive policy. It lowers the money you pay during claimed car repairs. It has the highest premium.Why you need Zero Depreciation Add-on· Your car’s value falls every year. This is called Depreciation. This affects you when you give the car for repair in the event of a mishap.· Your insurance company only pays a portion of the bill. This happens because the insurance company takes into consideration the depreciated value of the parts. However, a Zero-Depreciation policy avoids this. It will pay for the entire bill including the depreciation.· Usually, you can claim twice under a Zero-depreciation policy in a year.Here’s the approximate cost of the premium for a car worth Rs 4 lakh with an engine capacity of 1,200 cc.Third-party Rs. 2,237Comprehensive Policy Rs. 6,000Zero-Depreciation Rs. 8,000These costs further increase when you take on Add-ons.1. Add-on coverageYou can increase the protection the insurance offers through Add-ons. The more the Add-ons, the higher would be the car insurance premium.The four common Add-ons are:· Engine protection· NCB protection· Invoice cover· Personal Accident cover (another driver)2. Your car’s ageAs discussed earlier, your Insured Declared Value depends on your car’s value. But, this reduces every year. So, the older your car, the lower its value. This can lower your premium—and the sum assured.However, a higher age also makes the car riskier. It’s more susceptible to damages. So, car companies often check your car’s health while deciding the premium.3. Extra security featuresOne of the easiest ways to reduce your car insurance premium is by installing anti-theft and other security features.This is because insurance companies are in the business of lowering your risk.This comes at a price—the premiums you pay.The lower the risk, the lower is your insurance cost.4. Your claim historyCar insurance companies reward good drivers - those who do not claim.This is done through a ‘No-claim Bonus’.This bonus can be in the form of a discount on your premium. This reduces your car insurance cost.Similarly, if insurance companies see a history of multiple claims, it could drive up costs.

is 7 days too late for rabies vaccine after a possible nonbite exposure	can i take rabies injection after 1 day of dog bite	0	There was a sick, flea ridden stray pup near my home which seemed mortally ill. It would wander into my garden repeatedly and while picking it up and putting it away, I would grab it's head and my thumb and fingers brushed against the area near it's mouth/chin a couple of times. No scratches, no saliva, no biting or nibbling, nothing. Every time I would wash my hands with a liquid-handwash. But the pup died that very evening. It did not occur to me for several days that it could have died from rabies. Finally when I did, I rushed to my doctor and started an anti-rabies vaccine course on the seveth day, just to be on the safer side. Is it too late to get vaccination at day-7?	Yes, you should.One should take the vaccine as early as possible. More the delay, lesser is the probability of timely sero-conversion (production of enough antibodies in your body before the start of the actual disease so that disease can be prevented). Following are important points for the people in your situation-If you can trace the dog and know it is well/ alive for 10 days, you need not to worry because most of the rabid dogs will die within 10 days of appearance of rabies virus in its saliva. IDEALLY ONE SHOULD GET VACCINE ASAP AND may stop further doses if dog is well after 10 days of bite. But at least three doses are recommended.If you can not trace the dog and don’t know about its vaccination status, ideally you should get vaccinated ASAP. If you could not take vaccine immediately then TAKE IT AS EARLY AS POSSIBLE AT LEAST WITHIN A PERIOD OF ONE MONTH. Taking vaccine withing first two weeks gives you some chance of sero-conversion as well as disease prevention so for first two weeks are crucial for taking vaccine. After this the probability starts declining but its good to take a chance. There is no guideline on this but personally I think, one should even take vaccine till three months period because that is maximum range of incubation period and vaccine could have some role till that period if you have not shown any symptoms so far.
how many years britain ruled india	what is the standard amount of time off given for an international relocation	0	Britishers ruled India for 200 years. We got rid of them in 1947 and Robert Clive won the battle of Plassey in 1757, so that is a neat 190 years. What’s the problem?The problem is that Robert Clive only won over Bengal in 1757, which was a (major) province/kingdom in India. Here is how British rule in India looked like in 1805Some other dates are pertinent: Mysore state was won over in 1799, Marathas were finally defeated in 1818, and Sikh empire was finally defeated only by 1849. There might be other smaller kingdoms that fought even later but these three were major powers of the sub-continent.It seems that we can with better accuracy say that the British took nearly 100 years to conquer India and then ruled India for 100 years. In fact, the suppression of the 1857 revolt is when the rule really consolidated and officially passed to the British Empire. It was with the East India Company before that. The Company was one of the great powers on the Indian sub-continent but surely not its ruler.So why is this 200 years interpretation the popular one?Historical narrative is often subjected to current political constraints. The slaves of a foreign power for 200 years narrative seeks to build modern nationalism. As Benedict Anderson has found, shame is an important foundation of nationalism. Would a narrative saying Britishers ruled India for 90 years have the same impact in coalescing Indians with their primary loyalties to local communities or kingdoms into modern nationalistic Indian? The only power that could contradict the narrative — the British — would never do it for the opposite reason — pride. Rulers of India for 200 years? Sure, we will take that on our collective resumes.In the same vein, there is a new narrative of 1200 years of slavery that has been mentioned by the PM himself on multiple occassions. Now that we understand the underlying mechanism, this is similar to building a sense of shame that can create Hindu nationalism. Kashmiri separatists try the same with a narrative of foreign rule since 1586 (when Akbar invaded Kashmir) to instill the feelings of Kashmiri nationalism.Given that most of these narratives need suspension of reason (for example, one needs to forget the mighty Maratha Empire that lasted nearly 150 years in the 1200 narrative) it is puzzling why they last. The only reason I can think of is that the political objective powering the narrative is strong while there is none (or a weak one) that wants to counter it. People are mostly lazy thinkers (as Kahneman shows) and will accept narratives that are hurled at them repeatedly with force.I wish a sense of collectively, imagined future we can be proud of could act as a stronger basis of nationalism than an imagined history that we are ashamed of. History should be a matter of discovery where facts build stories and we are happy to adjust our stories as new facts emerge. The shared ordeal of the Independence movement and Indian constitution give us enough basis for a modern nationalism. The process of figuring a collective future and the energy needed to overcome current challenges can drive a modern nationalism. It seems more pragmatic to say — our time starts now and march towards the next 200 years.—Source from Medium–	A couple days to a week is typical. You NEVER accept an offer immediately and always ask for time. If it’s later in the week, it’s easy to ask for the rest of the week and the weekend to talk to your family and think things over - getting back to them on a Monday.If you get the offer on a Monday - asking if you can take until Friday should be fine.Many times, people are waiting to hear back from other jobs too - so getting some additional time is necessary to leverage this offer for others coming to fruition.Play it by ear as far as exact amount of days - the only thing you do NOT want to do is ask for too much time which would be 2 weeks and longer.Remember that you can always ask them for a deadline “How long do I have to think this offer over?” - they may say you have a week or until the 15th or the beginning of next month, so don’t be scared to ask.6 Key Questions to Ask During Salary Negotiations
how can i stop being afraid of working	how do you stop being afraid of everything	0	Best way to learn? Roll your sleeves up (Even proverbially) and listen to your boss. Listen to those who have done it before.Also cut yourself some slack, no one expects a “never worked before” 18 year old to walk in the door like a managing director. Remember, even the old guys had to start somewhere, they too had a first day and they too were pooping their pants.Just remember to be polite, and respectful. Don’t be afraid to admit your fears and ask for help. Most decent people shall feel proud that you asked them, then protective of you. Most decent people shall take you under their wing and help you all they can.In a mans environment you can also expect them to take the piss, send you on stupid errands like going to the store room and asking for tartan paint, a long stand and a bucket of blue mist. These are all signs of their acceptance of you. They mean no harm, they are just having a laugh.Expect foul language now and then, you are not in school any more and for goodness sake, don’t call them Mr Smith or what ever, certainly not sir, their first name please. Remember you aren’t in school anymore.Don’t be afraid. Its a big world and you are just getting started. Theres a lot to enjoy.Good luck and healthy regards,Brian.	"Hmm, this will be interesting...You and I sound very similar.  Contrary to popular belief, I grew up quite the terrified kid.  I was afraid to give class presentations, afraid to play in the piano recital, afraid to ask a girl out, afraid to go to the school dance because I didn't have any friends (except the ones I played World of Warcraft with online) and I thought everyone would make fun of me for going, etc.  To be honest, I was even afraid to go out to dinner with my family, or to go out anywhere, because I didn't know I had Celiac Disease until I was 18 years old and I constantly, every single day, had a stomach ache and felt like I needed to be close to a bathroom.And then somehow, miraculously, I overcame all of those fears.  Every single one.(Posting this photo because humans are visual people and it helps reinforce the story.)But let me tell you a different story, and one that will give you a more clear sense of how to overcome FEAR.One of my biggest fears growing up was expressing myself through my voice.  Now, the irony here is that my mom is actually a voice teacher.  Yes, she teaches students how to sing and use their voice to express themselves, and here I was dead terrified to open my mouth and say how I truly felt.When I went off to college, I started to get really interested in song writing.  I can't explain why, and to be honest I'm sure it was nothing more than a boyish hope that if I could write songs then girls would fall in love with me.  But instead of studying the John Mayers of the world, somehow I fell into the rhyme books of 2pac, The Notorious B.I.G., Method Mad, and Eminem.  I had always kept a journal growing up so by hobby I was a ""writer,"" but listening to the way they were able to take their words and give them life was, to me, the equivalent of hearing magic.  Rap took the silent art of writing and made it REAL.Except there was just one problem...I was beyond, BEYOND terrified to open my mouth and say what I had written on my loose leaf sheet of paper, out loud.  The first time I tried, I actually made my freshman year roommate (and now best friend) go to his car with me, and in the pitch black of night I turned on a 2pac song and rapped along with it as loud as I could.  In a nutshell, it was like watching a kid try to ride a skateboard for the first time, constantly hitting divots in the ground and rolling over gravel, the board falling out from under him and his face hitting the concrete.  I didn't know how to breathe, I was gasping in all the wrong places, I was cutting words short—I was trying to imitate one of the greatest rappers of all time so by virtue I sounded like a complete idiot, and above everything else, I made him turn the music so loud that you could barely hear me in the first place—because I was terrified of anyone actually listening to me.  (I have these early, early recordings still saved on my computer.  I'll release them one day...)When the song was finished I remember pausing the instrumental, turning to him and asking with a wide, hopeful look on my face, ""So?  What did you think?""It took everything in him not to tell me that I sounded like I'd been born with turret's syndrome.  ""It wasn't too bad!"" he said, and I nodded, wondering if he was telling me the truth.  ""You just need to keep practicing,"" he said, and for me that was enough.So I kept practicing.Except I was still so afraid!  Jesus, it astounds me now: I practiced in my dorm room closet where (hopefully) nobody would be able to hear me.  I practiced by sitting under a blanket with my scalding hot laptop on my lap, trying to insulate my voice and get a clearer sound through my iPod headphones.  When I got home from college for the summer I practiced in the old empty storage area in our basement (again under a blanket with my laptop) where I prayed nobody in my family could hear ..."
why does red keep the keys in oitnb	why does red keep the keys in season 4 of orange is the new black	1	The thing to know about Red is that she’s extremely conscious of power plays. While Litchfield offers many opportunities to throw your weight around without them, Red is a student of Vee. All the social promotion given by Ganya and the Russians didn’t keep Red from entering prison as scared, meek Galina Reznikov. She’s “Red” because of Vee. And she doesn’t let hatred of Vee keep her from learning things from her. Red explicitly forbids drugs. She makes drug use the dividing line between her family and the hillbillies, because Vee was a bloodsucking drug dealer. Red’s solution to winning her family back is to cook a big special dinner. Why? Because providing wholesome meals for her dixie cups like Taystee and RJ was how Vee kept them from telling her to get fucked when they wised up. By keeping Aydin’s keys, Red is demonstrating once again why she is Apollo Creed’s Rocky. Vee’s number one student.Do you remember the first episode where Piper was about to make her bed and Anita was like DON’T MAKE YOUR BED!!!! We’ll do it for you! Piper kept telling her that it was okay, that you all don’t have to do it, and Anita kept insisting. Well when Anita first moved into the transfer dorm at the same time as Red all those years ago, a woman named Carla did that to Anita, but it seemed so far from being a power play that Anita was just like ‘okay’. But then Vee came in and waved off Anita’s suggestion that “Carla’s gonna wanna do that for you” on the grounds that “I’ve been around before.” Anita right then figured out what the situation was, and so did Red who also watched this seemingly innocuous exchange. That’s right. Piper was hit with a power play in her first day at Litchfield not just from Red with the food, but from Anita DeMarco.The difference between how Red sees things and how more conventional criminal masterminds like Frida sees things is demonstrated this season with those guard’s keys. Frida was not in the Vee-School-Of-Ways-To-End-Up-Slocked-In-A-Greenhouse, so she takes the keys off Alex and Lolly’s hands as a simple present, like getting a magic key in Legend of Zelda or something. Red however knows that whoever owns these keys…is more powerful then the other inmates. Because Vee believed that “if you have something the girls want, they’ll respect you for it”, it was this advice that gave Red the perception of power over the others by the time we meet her in Season 1. Red has the contraband trade…and so even Claudette takes her to be someone not to mess with, lest she have to, for instance, obtain and hide her own vial of Mexican vanilla extract.	The thing to know about Red is that she’s extremely conscious of power plays. While Litchfield offers many opportunities to throw your weight around without them, Red is a student of Vee. All the social promotion given by Ganya and the Russians didn’t keep Red from entering prison as scared, meek Galina Reznikov. She’s “Red” because of Vee. And she doesn’t let hatred of Vee keep her from learning things from her. Red explicitly forbids drugs. She makes drug use the dividing line between her family and the hillbillies, because Vee was a bloodsucking drug dealer. Red’s solution to winning her family back is to cook a big special dinner. Why? Because providing wholesome meals for her dixie cups like Taystee and RJ was how Vee kept them from telling her to get fucked when they wised up. By keeping Aydin’s keys, Red is demonstrating once again why she is Apollo Creed’s Rocky. Vee’s number one student.Do you remember the first episode where Piper was about to make her bed and Anita was like DON’T MAKE YOUR BED!!!! We’ll do it for you! Piper kept telling her that it was okay, that you all don’t have to do it, and Anita kept insisting. Well when Anita first moved into the transfer dorm at the same time as Red all those years ago, a woman named Carla did that to Anita, but it seemed so far from being a power play that Anita was just like ‘okay’. But then Vee came in and waved off Anita’s suggestion that “Carla’s gonna wanna do that for you” on the grounds that “I’ve been around before.” Anita right then figured out what the situation was, and so did Red who also watched this seemingly innocuous exchange. That’s right. Piper was hit with a power play in her first day at Litchfield not just from Red with the food, but from Anita DeMarco.The difference between how Red sees things and how more conventional criminal masterminds like Frida sees things is demonstrated this season with those guard’s keys. Frida was not in the Vee-School-Of-Ways-To-End-Up-Slocked-In-A-Greenhouse, so she takes the keys off Alex and Lolly’s hands as a simple present, like getting a magic key in Legend of Zelda or something. Red however knows that whoever owns these keys…is more powerful then the other inmates. Because Vee believed that “if you have something the girls want, they’ll respect you for it”, it was this advice that gave Red the perception of power over the others by the time we meet her in Season 1. Red has the contraband trade…and so even Claudette takes her to be someone not to mess with, lest she have to, for instance, obtain and hide her own vial of Mexican vanilla extract.
at what age should someone lose their virginity	at what age how and where did you lose your virginity	0	I lost my virginity when I was 12 years old.I had 2 male best friends at the time and the rest of them were girls. They were both older than me but we were really close to. I was in 6th grade and they were in 8th. So them being 14 almost 15 they were more interested in girls. Before having sex i did let them touch me and stuff like i let them rub and squeeze booty because I had a nice butt for my age and they never got to before. I also let them feel my boobs and vagina. We also kissed and they let me feel them to. As you can see the 3 of us were very close. Then one day during lunch we were sitting in one of the hallways in the basement that know one goes down ever and we started talking about whatever and one of them had their arm around me with his hand on as much of my butt as he could because we were sitting down. And the other one had his hand on my thigh and he was gently rubbing it and started getting closer to my crotch and i was getting horny. Then the one with his arm around me started to lightly kiss my neck. then I was super horny moaning a little and i was getting wet and they knew because I was wearing leggings and no panties so it was very noticeable. Then they were both rubbing my thighs and vagina. I started to rub their cocks and when they were ready before i knew it my leggings were off and I was riding one of them while sucking the other. It was hard because i had nothing to rest on but while standing i took it from behind while sucking one of them. I don't remember exactly but i think they both finished in my mouth and I swallowed because we wouldn't want to make a mess. We had sex many times afterwards and it ended when they got to their sophomore year because they were at a different school and i was in 8th grade and they were getting busy so we didn't have any time after school. We eventually stopped talking and never seen each other again.	I had it at the age of 23 when I was studying in an institution in Bangalore. I am was a boy from Punjab. I hated south India and called the people madrasis. I thought everybody was dark here but I changed because of Mallu girl or Malayali girl called Nandini Menon from Thiruvananthapuram.She changed my virginity status. She was a very hot girl like hearthrobe of the out batch.Very beautiful very firm breasts red strawberry lips very fair and a little brown hair.I never saw her wear skirts but one day I went to her room to see her room mate as she was my friend. I pressed the bell and Nandini opened the door she was wearing shorts her legs were so fair and beautiful. I talked to her then my friend came. I took the number of Nandini after sometime we met everyday and I told her that I was a virgin. I invited her to my house one day.She came we studied together and then it was too late for her to go I told her to stay in my house.I suddenly went near her lips and kissed it gently she touched my skin under my shirt as a sign of encouragement I kissed her removed her shirt and squeezed her breasts and kissed her nipples and sucked her Saliva and kissed her beautiful naval region.Then moved toward her vagina were I sucked again and we had penetrated sex with condoms.She told me forget about Everything that happen previous night and left after that we were just friends but now she is my wife. We have 2 children also.
how forgetful are you	how can i forget my wife	0	Too muchWait a minute, i show you how much i am forgetful person.The whole story is like that, today's my brother in law (jija) was going to varanasi for dropping his friends.where they take flight and go to mumbai. My house is also lies between in way to Varanasi.So i call to my sister.And said, send her child with them. Whose name is Shiva the most loveable person in our house.He is just 2 years old and he is our joy. My cute nephewHe comes we play to much and we doing too much fun. When jiju return, i am going to drop my nephew in street corner, where jiju was stand with their car.In our culture ,son in law not allow to go there 'in law place' (sasural).They start going to their sasural after the ceremony of their welcome.Here ceremony means, like the marriage of wife's brother (sala) or wife's sister (sali).So i am going to drop my nephew. I take him through the help of one hand in lap. And through help of other hand i take the small bag. In bag, his clothes and water bottles had.So when i meet jiju ,i gave in his lap to shiva and greet.we talk and he also give bakshish(tip). And important thing is, i forget to handover the bag to him which is in my hand. They gone. When i reached to near my house my mother asked, you dont delivered the bag?. Then i realised, oh my god i forget to handover the bag.Look how much i forget the things. And one thing, this is only one story of my forgetful mind. I remember also other stories of my forgettable art	Thinking it as a loss of half life is causing pain.But the experience is very much still with you. The biggest meditation in this world is a mind that lets go. Chant OM repeatedly and just let go.
would you switch from canon 6d to leica dlux 109	what tripod should i get for my canon 6d	0	It depends.I personally think that with a 50mm 1.4 / 1.8 and maybe a 24mm, you can suffice 95% of the pictures you can take. One of the best zooms are your legs!However, the Canon is quite heavy, even with light lenses. If you are going to walk around or hike a lot, the Canon may become hard on your arms after a while. The 6D (with a lens stated above) will be around 30 oz. However, the Leica 109 is only 8 oz. You can carry this around ALL DAY and not feel a thing.The Leica has 10.1 mp vs the 20.2 mp of the 6D. If you are doing more serious photography, you will have to stick with the Canon. If it’s more for fun though, the Leica will be fine.So: if you are taking pictures for less than 5–6 hours a day and you are doing it more seriously, use the Canon with a few versatile prime lenses.Otherwise, the Leica will be perfect.Happy Shooting!	To begin, the tripod isn’t just a tripod, it is a tripod and a head. The distinction between the 2 parts is important, since you can put a variety of heads on a tripod and have it serve a variety of purposes. A quick search on eBay will reveal the availability of both, with prices ranging easily into the 5 figures.So, the answer to this question depends on what you want to do with your 6D. This is a professional camera and the newest item on Canon’s full frame list. As such, it takes an amazingly rich photograph. However, it is also a video camera with a full frame sensor, turning out wonderfully shaded and focused video with professional qualities to it.For photography, a smoothly ADJUSTABLE tripod is the trick. The photographer will want to get a variety of angles to serve the purpose of his shot. So, being able to adjust on all axis is what you want out of the head. This will allow you to level your camera without having to level your tripod. If the 6D is anything like the 5Diii, you can get a level to appear on your viewing screen by pushing the “info” button twice. This is far more convenient than it sounds; when you're shooting a night landscape, leveling the unit can be more challenging than you can imagine.But if you’re shooting video, you are probably going to be more concerned with PANNING and tilting smoothly. This is where it helps to have a “fluid head.” The mechanism contains oil and the machine works with a heavy smoothness that is essential to that perfect motion of the camera. Most videographers I know spend a great deal of time practicing pans and tilts with their tripods so the second take of a shot isn’t being done because of a jump or jerk in the pan.One quality I would watch for is the feet of the tripod. You want a tripod system that can adapt to your location. I’m a Manfrotto fan, personally. I find their line has a multiplicity of choices for both activities. But there are many brands that make a decent tripod. Get one that can handle the job and the terrain on which you’re shooting.Good Luck and happy shooting.

what are stereotypes about the united kingdom	what do americans think about the united kingdom	0	"I can only speak for the stereotypes peddled by Americans, but here goes.That our food is awful when it's far better than American food in most respects.That our parliamentary system is terrible (compared to Congress?).That we still doff our caps and say ""ello guvna"".That we all say Simon Says alot in a fake English Accent.That the Cotswolds ARE England."	I love England! Let me say that again:I LOVE ENGLAND!So, I think that Brits are best friends I haven’t met yet.A British man, his wife and their three kids were visiting some of my friends this past summer. And I have to say that my friends have about 40 acres in the country here in western Kentucky. We were all over at their house one Sunday afternoon for barbecue. The Brit and I were talking and he casually asked if he could see my handgun. He did not ask me if I had one. I had not said anything about owning one. He simply assumed that I did indeed own a handgun because the British seem to believe that ALL Americans have handguns. And, he wanted to see it. So, I showed it to him - My S&W 686 Plus. We took it out back and fired off about 100 rounds through it. His wife got to shoot it as did his teenage son. They thought I was the hero of the century.So, anyway I want to go to England so badly for a vacation that it breaks my heart that I haven’t had the money yet. Here is a list of the things I want to do when I get there:…to visit Royal Albert Hall. Maybe I’ll catch a Clapton concert there.…to visit the Tower of London…do a pub crawl with friends for a pint of stout in each place…to visit the place where they video Top Gear (maybe I’ll get to meet the Stig)…to attend a race at Brands Hatch…take a ride in a Hackney carriage…answer the age-old Jethro Tull question: “Was it really true there are elephants and lions too in Picadilly Circus?” LOL…take a selfie at that spot where the Beatles made their Abbey Road album cover…to interview some Brits about just what all this fuss is about Brexit?…to drive a right-hand drive MG or Austin Healey on some British country roads.…take a ride on the Romney, Hythe and Dymchurch Railway…take a ride in a double decker bus…buy, borrow or steal a black Mac for a souvenir…learn and commit to memory all of the derogatory slang terms for Americans and use them to develop a beautiful bag of snappy comebacks. LOL I mean, hey! It’s all in fun - right? (I already know that I am NOT a tosser)…to visit the Imperial War Museum and the Churchill War Rooms in London.…to pay respect to all those Brits and Americans who lost their lives in that dammed war.…to show the greatest respect and friendship to any and all I meet and to make many new friends while gaining a lifetime’s worth of new memoriesI think that this is a pretty good list for a start. I’ll work on it some more.
how do i use twitter as a business source	how can i use twitter for business	1	Twitter has been one of the easiest way to promote Business and I made more sales on Twitter than any other Social Media Business Accounts!Complete your profile (don’t forget to input your website, it’s really important to drive traffic to your site.)DO NOT BUY FOLLOWERS. I’ve read a lot that you should buy followers in order to gain followers easier. However, based on my experience, buying followers is a bad move to your business! It looks good on your profile having huge followers but it will have no engagement and it will be hard for you to find and communicate well to your real followers! Most of the success stories on building an empire on twitter is a consistent effort of following real people and hope for a followback.

I tried manual direct messaging when I gained new followers and I received great and fast replies and a real interaction. I got tired on manual so I used a tool, crowdfire to be exact. It’s a good tool but it looks unprofessional because I was only using the free account so it has -@crowdfire at the end of my message. Since I did auto direct messaging, I didn’t get any replies, and if I did, it’s a promotion of other people and I never get an interaction. :( So, always beware on automating things, if you want to remove the -@crowdfire, you should pay for the tool to make it look personal message to your gained followers.FOCUS on type of your tweets. Will you tweet a “text”, “picture”, “infographics”? If you are planning to tweet a text, be consistent, if you’re going to tweet picture, be consistent, as well as on infographics. Focus on that.

how can i transfer money from skrill to a paypal account	how can i send money from my paypal account to my skrill account to withdraw	0	There are various ways to do so but they all use third party services. Not only they take longer time to transfer most are untrudted. Is there any specific reason why you want to transfer the funds this way? As not only the third paety will charge you a fee but even after that there is no gurantee you will get yur funds. Another set of ways are to register with sites like peopleperhour.com and worldgaming.com but again these would take a while to work. The method is to sign up using skrill deposit funds from there and withdraw them onto paypal. Alternatively you could also open a new skrill account and transfer the funds fron your account to this new account maybe of your brother, or any other family member and withdraw the funds.	You can send money from a PayPal account to a Skrill account by visiting PayPalcorner.com and click on 'PayPal to Skrill' (you will be required to first purchase a customer number. You buy this number only once and use it whenever you sending money from PayPal on the website).

which is correct  looking forward to speak with you or look forward to speak with you	which is correct speak with or speak to	0	Thanks for the A2A, Yoav!Original question: Which is correct - 'Looking forward to speak with you' or 'Look forward to speak with you'?Looking forward and look forward are both correct in this context. But you must change speak with to speaking with.Note that in the first construction the subject-helping verb I am is implied. I am looking forward to... sounds more familiar and casual than the other.I am looking forward to speaking with you this weekend.I am looking forward to hanging out with you after school.I am looking forward to getting to know you better at the party.In the second it is only the subject I that is implied. I look forward to... sounds more formal and businesslike than the other.I look forward to speaking with you soon or I look forward to hearing from you soon sounds like the last sentence in a cover letter in an application for a job. That does not mean that one is always and only formal and one is always and only casual, but that relative to each other one sounds more formal than the other, the other sounds more casual than the first. For example, depending on his posture and expression and tone of voice, etc., a school bully could use either to invite you to meet him after school:School bully 1: I look forward to beating you to a pulp after school, punk. He sounds menacing, powerful, authoritative. I is standing motionless, no expression on his face. School bully 2: I am looking forward to beating you to a pulp after school, punk! He is enjoying himself, an evil grin on his face. He is rubbing his hands together, anxious to use them to beat me up.These are not absolutes, just examples of how I hear the difference!Hope this helps!

which are the best engineering fields	what is the best field of engineering	1	Computer Science & Engineering / ITSoftware engineers are the most sought after in India. So, it is no surprise that this branch is right at the top! This branch offers higher pay packages than any other branch as well as ample overseas job opportunities. If you have an interest in database management and application development, you should seek out this engineering discipline.Your starting salaries as a fresh computer engineer from a good institute can range between Rs 4.5 lakh to Rs 6 lakh. You will start as trainees or development engineers and then move on to designations like design engineer, project manager and eventually CTO. As you move up the management ranks, your pay can go up from Rs 20 lakh to Rs30 lakh per annum.Some of the top companies that hire CSE engineers include Microsoft, Google, Yahoo, Amazon, IBM, Facebook, Oracle, Cisco, Infosys, TCS, and Wipro.Some of the top institutes (apart for the IITs and NITs) include:IT-BHUIndian School of Mines University-DhanbadIndian Institute of Information Technology- HyderabadBITS PilaniElectronics & Communication EngineeringYou study this branch and you will become a gadget guru! You will learn all about digital electronics and logic design, fundamentals of communication engineering, electronic circuits, signals and systems, power electronics, applied electromagnetic theory, integrated circuits, VLSI etc. Go for this engineering specialisation if you have a strong base (and interest) in calculus & physics (semiconductors etc). The telecommunications industry & mobile development industry have been progressing by leaps & bounds in the last few years and would offer excellent opportunities to graduates.If you have a B.Tech or a similar degree from a good institution, you can expect to earn anything between Rs 4 lakh to Rs 6 lakh a year. As you work your way up in the organisation and learn implementation, architectural and design level skills, you could make about Rs 10 lakh a year.Some of the main recruiters of Electronic Engineers will be Bharat Electronics Limited (BEL), Electronics Corporation of India Limited (ECIL), Intel, Samsung Electronics, Sony, Toshiba, Philips Semiconductors, Texas Instruments, LG Electronics, Nokia, CISCO etc.Some of the Best institutes (apart for the IITs and NITs) include:Delhi Technological University (DTU)PEC University of Technology, ChandigarhElectrical & Electronics EngineeringThere will always be opportunities for electrical engineers as this is an evergreen field. You will learn about transmission and generation of electrical power, electrical circuit design, electronics, instrumentation, control systems etc. There are a lot of openings for this profile in the government sector. You might get to work in steel factories, the railways, at construction sites or handle automated systems in which electricity supply and distribution plays a crucial role.An entry-level engineer earns about Rs 20,000-30,000 per month. Salaries vary from industry to industry. At a middle-level technical position, e.g. a project head or team leader, one gets Rs 70,000-80,000 per month. At the managerial level, a senior manager earns Rs 1.5 lakh per month.Some companies you should look out for during placements: Bajaj International Private Ltd., Bharat Heavy Electricals Limited (BHEL), Centre for Electronics Design and Technology, Crompton Greaves Limited (CGL), Siemens Ltd., Reliance power Ltd.Best institutes (apart for the IITs and NITs) include Delhi Technological University (DTU).Mechanical EngineeringAnother evergreen field, there will always be opportunities here, despite varying market trends. It is one of the oldest and the most demanding branch of engineering and therefore one of the broadest. As a mechanical engineer, you will get to design, analyse, manufacture and maintain anything that moves!Entry-level salaries range from about Rs 1.3 lakh to Rs 3...	Curiosity is the key to passionIf any student would have asked any individual, which platform is best to have my engineering. Then, the advancement of the field would never had been possible. The actual thing that matters is your interest.Even though, if someone suggest you a field in engineering. At, long run you would find that things are not in the way you wanted. There are enormous example, where the students from prestigious institutions went for Computer science & engineering as its pays well. As they were good at PCM, they manage to secure very good rank.But, PCM can't decide whether you will also be good at coding stuffs. At that time, computer system is not going to listen that, “ hey! I'm from this prestigious institution… Make my codes compile or interpret”.And even though when they manage to secure a seat in Mnc’s. But again in long run, when the organization doesn't found them eligible. They kick them out, without the second justification. And believe me, the number of cases related to the above mentioned is really recognizable.So, coming back to question,First ask yourself, whether you really want that Er. tag, or as because the rest of the world is doing the same. So, you are also following the mob. If, No then do the following :Explore about multiple feilds of engineering yourself.Gather information about the life at that field.What are it's scope in coming future.If possible earn experience about that field from your kins.And, after examine of all the data and figures. Make sure that you choose a stream in which you never get tired to repeatedly doing the same piece of work till your last breath.Thanks for A2A.
how do you make life suit you and stop life from abusing you mentally and emotionally	why are emotionally abusive people in my life several ex boyfriends friends and past coworkersbosses have been abusers do i attract them	0	"I like to talk shit about myself, to myself, and let my self come to my rescue.Say things out loud like, ""your stupid. Your boring. Nobody likes you. Your ass is fat. Your annoying. You have no skills. You have no talents. You have nothing to offer"" Your mind will instantly reject those thoughts... Even though you may think that's how you feel, your body knows it's a lie.When you say those statements aloud, your body will hear it as a lie. As if you said, ""the sun is pink"" Instantly your mind will insert (yellow) into your thoughts.In the same way, your mind will come to your defense when you tear yourself down.Accepting yourself is the key to accepting life, as it means accepting reality. You can only play with the cards you've been dealt, and every hand you have could be your last. Stop being defeated by the shitty parts of life holding you back. Access each day, week, and year with what you've got, who you are,and what you can count on. Once you learn to live this way you can silence the noise in your mind and begin to feel peace, finally finding happiness in every day of life you have.Forgive yourself and forgive others and show yourself some love because you can be whatever kind of person you want to be, REGARDLESS of your pain or your past or your shitty unfair present."	Rick give a good answer in his ‘rant’. But it is only half of the picture. There is more to it then just attraction because it is what you learned to love.There is another really important facet to this issue. And you might not realize it, but you actually hit the nail on the head with your last words. You do attract them. Not in a literal way of course, but they will sense that you are ‘available’ to them “to be abused” when they get to know you.This has everything to do with the way you are. Your own personality. You have been raised in a way that made you into who you are. You have acquired certain behavioral patterns during your upbringing, that will fit the behavioral patterns of abusers like two pieces of the same puzzle.This makes you feel comfortable with them, and feel them comfortable with you, before you even know what is going on.Part of dealing with this is getting to know the behavior of abusers so you recognize this. But the other part is recognizing your own behavioral patterns that lead to the attraction of those predators.
what is the difference between gross salary and ctc	there seems to be a difference between my weekly paycheck and the yearly salary my employer agreed upon how does that work	0	"Definitions:Gross salary (also called Base or Basic salary)The actual salary the company pays to you (not what you receive in your account). This is generally the term referred to as simply ""salary"".Net SalaryThe actual salary (money only) that you receive in hand/in your bank account. This is the gross salary minus government taxes. Also referred to as ""in-hand"" or ""take-away"" salary.CTC (Cost to Company)The total amount the company will be directly or indirectly paying if it hires you.This includes every possible cost the company pays for you that you possibly can't even imagine.Example:A company has compensation listed as:Base pay: 10,000 per annumJoining bonus (this is a one-time bonus that the company gives you for joining them): 3,000Stock award (over a period of X years): 5,000With the following perks:Free foodFree insuranceThen,CTC = 10,000 + 3,000 + 5,000 + cost of food for one employee per year + cost of insurance for the employeeIn a way the CTC is a deliberate misrepresentation of salary (which is supposed to be ""per annum""), to attract people. In the above case, the joining bonus of 3K is payable only once, but it feels that the employee will earn 13K per annum."	You earn $36,000 a year.There are 52 weeks in one year.You worked one of those weeks (40 hours)$36,000 divided by 52 weeks is $692.31.It appears they have short-paid you $0.31. This might make you seem petty, but if you wanted to, you could complain to the payroll department to point out the mathematical inaccuracy (assuming you haven't misstated the amount you were paid in your question).Am I missing something?What you were missing is that 4 (weeks) x 12 (months) = 48 weeks, not 52 weeks. In other words, there are actually 4.33 weeks in a month on average (52 weeks divided by 12 months), not 4.I hope this helps. :)
which are the prospering towns in kerala	why are there so many christians in kerala	0	There are 10’s of growing towns in Malabar like Perinthalmanna, Tirur all depending on Gulf money. But, they are slightly less urban/cosmopolitian compared to the growing towns in central Kerala. Muvattupuzha in the east of Kochi will grow into another medium sized city given the way it is expanding. Thodupuzha also is seeing much higher growth compared to Muvattupuzha.	Christianity like anyother religion is result of a lot of build up stories and extensive marketing by authoritative people. And when it comes to Kerala there are too many fairy tales , miracles and big budget Orthodox, Protestant and Catholic churches than anyone can imagine on a comparatively smaller locality. I personally don't think the story behind the Nasrani or Syrian/St Thomas Christians origin has got any proof to substantiate . There is no proof either if there was an apostle named St.Thomas ever existed in the first place. Almost all people of the early AD's were named exactly the same and some guy named Thomas might have preached some form of Christianity (or more precisely some Jewish mixed Christianity among some of the early localites of Kerala). There is fake story that namboothiri brahmins got converted to christians . Why should the privileged brahmins of that time willever be interested in Christianity, Most likely a bunch of lower caste people might have voluntarily came to Christianity due to the class intolerance existed at those times.All these Christian denominations are highly irritating because they altogether made the principles we stand for look too complicated , created a lot of divisions , sub divisions, classes & virtual partitions among themselves and the original version of what God actually said (if he ever did say something to so called only ancient people) is ultimately lost among the goofed up people made stories.All in the name of power and money, nothing else.

how do i switch from apple music to spotify	should i switch from spotify to apple music	0	Soundiiz is web solution helping you to transfer your collection between music services.Soundiiz can move playlists and also your favorites tracks, albums and followed artists to Spotify.You can check here a Soundiiz tutorial to Switch from Apple Music to Spotify.No need to download any application, it’s a web service available directly in your browser on desktop, tablet and mobile.	I’ve been using Spotify, then switched to Apple Music and now is switching back to Spotify. I also tried Amazon Music (don’t even think about it) and few other semi-free services like AccuRadio and Soundcloud (they are good actually, if you need a carefully selected music stream (not specific tracks) and can live with a little ads here an there).Back to Spotify vs. Apple MusicThey both have same prices for single and family subscriptions now, have pretty similar music catalogues, works both on mobile and desktop and still quite different in their approach.Apple MusicPros:Curated Human Playlists from Beats team — they are great and very diverse. Spotify has none to compete (or it’s very hard to find - e.g. Resident Advisor has own playlists on Spotify — good luck to try to locate them)Beats 1 radio - it’s good. Too much focused on hip hop and still good. Mostly British DJs (way better than American)TV shows (Carpool karaoke, Planet of the Apps and others)Tight integration with iOS and tvOS ( and HomePod if you are crazy enough to buy this overpriced plastic speaker)Cons:Android app is awful (both interface and stability). and I use AndroidAlgorithmic playlists are subpar quality vs. SpotifyPlaylists are too short — about 1hr that is not enough usuallyEverything is too focused on hip hop. It may be okay if you listen to hip hop only, otherwise it will bother you soon.TV shows are weird quality (Carpool karaoke is utter joke w/o James Corden; Planet of the Apps is underperforming)SpotifyPros:Superb algorithmic playlists like Discover Weekly, New Releases5–6 different (and good) algorithmic playlists tailored specifically for you — one day you want Post Punk, another day Nu Disco — no problem!Good Android AppHi-Res audio quality option for premium subscribersCons:No human editorial curated playlists (and it’s a BIG minus). User playlists can't compete with professional curated selection.No TV shows or any other “own” content - they really have to start producing own content (like Netflix started few years ago)iOS integration is not smoothDon’t forget that you can listen to Spotify for free (with ads and limitations) and have no this option with Apple Music. I recommend to subscribe for a free Apple Music trial for 3 months and try free Spotify simultaneously — three moths is more than enough to decide what do you want.

between robert de niro and al pacino who is more successful	who do you regard as the best actor robert de niro or al pacino	0	Both are successful actors and are regarded as greatest actors of their time.If you measure success in terms of money, after a certain amount of money, you wont really need more to live life with. Both of them have made such a money,But acting-wise, Robert de niro  was appreciated for his varied performances from comedies to a cold hearted killer, Pacino limited the wide scopes and focussed in hero/antihero roles and nailed it too.De Niro: Action-Comedies-Supporting-Role transformation-Perfection.Pacino: Action-Supporting-Firm Personality-perfection.Whatever they did, they did great. Unique and perfect.	They are both my favourite actors hands down. They are extremely talented and charismatic. How can anyone choose? It is a matter of opinion at the end of the day as talent in acting cannot be measured objectively like singing. If a singer does not perform well it is evident, everone can hear imperfections in singing, even those who are not musically trained. But, when it comes to acting, how can anyone chose? If i have to choose one however that would be Al Pacino. Why?Robert Deniro is a very talented actor as well as hard working . When he takes a role he throws himself at work to become that character in every single way. He is very dedicated and very commited to every project he takes, at least in the beginning of his career he was because later he wasted his talent on average movies. When he starred in Godfather 2, for which he deservedly won an oscar, he spent 3 months in Sicily to master Vito Corleone’s accent. Not the Italian accent, the sicilian accent!! When he did Raging Bull he actually took boxing classes, he put on weight to look like his character, he trained hard to have a boxer’s body. When he starred at taxi driver he actually drove a taxi on night shifts in New York to be convincing. Meryl Streep and Joe Pesci have both stated he is a perfectionist and he has an eye for the detail. He studies hard his character, he always does his homework. No doubt about that, he is serious about his craft, he takes his roles personally.However, Al Pacino works with his instinct. He does not visit his character’s hometown to understand him. It comes natural to him. For instance, when he did the Scarface he did not need to go to Cuba to master Montana’s accent. He killed it anyway, even if the accent was not 100% accurate. When he played the junkie in Panic in the needle park he did not spend hours on the streets with drug addicts to study their mannerisms but the man slayed. When he starred in Justice for all he did not start studying law books to convice us as an attorney. He did any way. Al Pacino’s performances in the Godfather 1, the Godfather 2, dog day afternoon, Panic in the needle park, Justice for all and even Scarface just SLAY. It is poetry, pure magic. He doesn’t exaggerate, he doesn’t scream, he doesn’t manipulate the viewer, he is honest. He plays from his heart. Though i do admire De niro’s commitment to his roles on every level- body tranformation, accent - i believe Pacino acts more naturally and more effortlessly. He is a born actor.It is a very tough choice indeed but if i have to choose one i ‘ll go with Pacino every day.

how can i stop being addicted to love	how do i stop being addicted to someone	0	Is there any need for you to be far away from love? I don't think. Love is what which makes you do anything that you think is not possible.Like:-For mother: to see her smiling face and sparkling eyes you do everything.For love: you can do anything to make them feel special, happy, and to prove how much you love them. Definition of LOVE-​P.S- decision is yours whether you want to love or not.And if not then just stay away from being so close to a girl or a boy with whom you think are getting closer. I hope this helps you.	I learned to keep my phone as boring as possible.I used to have so many games and apps, downloaded movies and series for me watch while commuting, pdfs of ebooks.Why does it seem I end up adding more and more to my phone instead of finishing the books and games I currently have?It will never be enough on your phone. There's always something new and the endless scrolling tricks our brains to keep going.My tips for minimizing phone use:DELETE SOCIAL MEDIA APPS. unless you're making money off social media, you're just another hamster in the wheel being fed glittered up bs. There's no point in social media! If you were hot shit, people would know your name either way. Does your sister in law or old best friend from college REALLY need a like from you for them to know you care? Step your relationships up then in real life!Turn it off during school/work. You can get a nice 3–5 hr block without a phone. There's nothing that important that you need to have it on during a time when you should be focusing/studying. And most people just go on another endless screen anyway, like a laptop or computer for school/work. Another distraction but at least it's one less screen in your face.Uninstall the apps you haven't even opened since you downloaded it.Try not to make your phone your convenient, all-in-one device. Unless youre always traveling and need things to be as simple as possible, stop giving power to a device by putting your life on it. Pick up a REAL book or print out that ebook to read. Most of us aren't that busy that we need to be like Kris Jenner managing 15 different people and deals.This one is most controversial, but…become a bad texter. Let people get used to you responding to their messages after a while. Being a trained monkey responding to your phone within a few seconds makes it easier to break your concentration and thoughts for real life. Of course, be there for someone when they need it or asking you time-sensitive questions. You'll find that the people who pick up conversations as if nothing happened are some of the best people you'll EVER met and keep them close!!Any mindless activity that can make an hour pass by like it's nothing is threatening to your goals and plans. When was the last time you were able to pick up a book and end up reading for 10+ minutes because you got lost in it? It's definitely been a while for me, but just this morning I spent 30minutes reading sports news before I even got up to use the bathroom after waking.Be mindful of your time and the endless black mirror in your hands!

I agree that such a prank might come back to haunt you in the end but the short answer is:  it would depend on how good each is at surveillance and at counter-surveillance.  These are two distinct skills and even someone who is very experienced as a surveillant will often be as clueless as anyone else with respect to DETECTING surveillance on himself.  I suppose that, if both P.I.s were highly skilled in surveillance but lacked training in counter-surveillance, the game could go on for quite a long time.

Here comes another application so called Wi Fi History.	"Well, there can be lots of issues. You need to give more details.Anyways, I had the same problem. I was tinkering with my Router and I had changed my DNS Servers from ""Get automatically from ISP"" to using OpenDNS servers you know, just for fun and to see their ""parental controls"".After 2 days or so, Quora stopped working for me. Both app and the website. I just couldn't figure out the problem. I even contacted the ISP and there was no solution. After a lot of thinking, I realized it might have been due to the change in DNS Servers so instead of using OpenDNS, I opted for Google DNS Servers and guess what? It worked! :DSo my suggestion would be, change your DNS servers. If you don't know how, leave a comment or read my bio and get in touch with me and I will help you.Good luck."
what was the significance of the battle of somme and how did this battle compare and contrast to the battle of rostov	what was the significance of the battle of somme and how did this battle compare and contrast to the battle of riyadh	1	The significance of the Battle of the Somme is that for many it signifies the senseless waste and slaughter of the First World War. Towards the end of 1915 the Allied commanders on the Western Front held a meeting in which they would determine the direction the Allies would take in the next year. They agreed that there would be a joint Anglo-French offensive spanning either side of the Somme river while simultaneous offensive would take place on the Italian and Eastern front. Meanwhile the German high command had their own plan which Falkenhayn came up with. Falkenhayn had realised that Germany’s main enemy in the war is Britain because even if they could beat the French they would still have to cross the channel which was impractical given the Royal navies dominance at seas, so Falkenhayn realised that to win he had to knock England’s best sword out of her hand as he phrased and beat the French. To do this he would attack and capture Verdun and then let the French bleed themselves white trying to take it back. On 21st February Falkenhayn launched his offensive with an enormous barrage by 1200 guns in a small narrow sector. Within two days the Germans had fired 2 million shells and then they attacked . The attack was successful in some areas and difficult in other areas. As a result of this attack the French began pouring more and more divisions into the Verdun down the road they would christen the Sacred way. As more and more french division were sucked into a wilderness of shell craters and blood they realised that they would not be able to fully support the offensive on the Somme as planned and as a result the offensive became largely a British affair. Over the next few months as the bloodbath at Verdun continued huge numbers of British troops from the New army or Kitchener’s army as they were called began to flood into Amiens in preparation as well as huge numbers of shells being stockpiled. The Germans could not fail to notice this so they began to prepare accordingly. In the week leading up to the 1st of July (the set start of the offensive) the Britsh artillery began to rain down shells day and night on the German lines day and night without end. During the week of shelling 1.5 millions shells were fired however at least 1/3rd of all shells failed to explode which would have tragic consequences on the 1st of July as the wire would remain uncut. On the 1st of July 1916 the offensive began at 7:30 in the morning with 5 divisions of French troops on the south side of the Somme, 11 British divisions of General Rawlinson’s 4th army and 2 divisions of the British third army opposite Gommecourt. At the same time mines were blown all along the front with two notable mines blown being at Hawthorn ridge and the Lochnagar crater. 150 000 men along and 18 mile front emerged from their trenches and walked in some places and ran in others. The Germans upon hearing the artillery stop knew the time for the attack had come and emerged from their dugouts in which they hidden from the bombardment, and began setting up their machine guns. Across the field of no man’s land they could see line after line of British infantry marching forward and could not have asked for better targets. The advancing British were mown down in droves. An example of the slaughter is the attack made by the Newfoundland regiment that were attacking Beaumont Hamel in the Norther sector of the battlefield. Out of a regiment of 750 men who attacked only 68 could answer muster the next day. To the north of the Albert Bapaume upon which the offensive was taking place the attacks achieved nothing but horrendous casualties while South of the road there were some limited successes while the french sector saw a quick advance that got bogged down. At the end of the day the casualties had been horrific with the British suffering 57 000 casualties of which 19 000 were killed...

what would happen if you cover one of your eyes with an eye patch for one year then take the patch off	what happens if eye medicine enters the eye	0	The Eye Patch treatment would only work with patients under 12 yrs or less.Eye patch for a year wouldn’t bring much but some improvement.Waearing an eye patch on your strong eye would help your weaker eye to strengthen itself, and improve eyesight.	Well, a lot of it is supposed to, or it wouldn't have its intended effect. I'm a little confused by the question… Why do you think most therapeutic medications are put into the eye, and how else would you imagine that they could have their desired effect? For example, all glaucoma medications, most if not all antibiotics, steroids, and anti inflammatory drops penetrate through the outer tissues of the eye, and enter the eye. That is where they are designed to have their effectiveness. So the “drug makers” pharmacists and drug delivery scientists, have to make sure that the drugs, in their drop formulation, will penetrate into the eye sufficiently to provide a high enough concentration within the eye to be effective, while staying dissolved within an aqueous solution that does not burn or irritate the eye when dropped into the eye, is stable in solution for a reasonable amount of time (think commercial shelf life), and not likely to get contaminated. Not an easy job! (This question would be better answered by someone - pharmacist or scientist who has actually worked in this field; it's really “out of my pay grade”).So tear film compatibility, and resistance to dilution by the tear film becomes important. If I make a great eye drop, but it stings like crazy when patients put it in their eye, what do you think happens? One, compliance goes down - patients won't use it as often as they should, and tear secretion dilutes the medication and washes it away. So, great drug, but not very effective.So the real question is not “what happens when eye medication gets into the eye” , but how to get eye medications into the eye effectively and safely.Addendum: some eye drops are not supposed to penetrate into the inside of the eye, like artificial tears; and they don't. Injecting artificial tears into the eye would probably cause a severe inflammatory reaction. Don't try this at home kids.
is it possible to pursue many different things in life	how do i refuse to chose between different things to do in my life	1	Instead of a yes or no answer, I’d like to introduce you to Story Musgrave.Haven’t heard of him? Aside from being a NASA Astronaut, Story has spent equal time in his life as a Marine, Doctor, Designer, Engineer, Artist, Mathematician, Speaker and Consultant. He holds six formal academic degrees, not because he was chasing credentials, but because he found them fascinating.His started his journey studying for an MA in Music and Biology in Massachusetts, before dropping out to join the marines. He served in Korea as an aircraft crew chief while completing duty assignments aboard the carrier USS Wasp in the Far East. Here, he discovered his passion for flying, which he kept with him for life, flying over 17,700 hours in 160 different types of civilian and military aircraft (oh, and he’s skydived 800 times too).After the marines, Story received a B.S. degree in Mathematics and Statistics from Syracuse University in 1958, an MBA degree in Operations Analysis and Computer Programming from the University of California, Los Angeles in 1959, and a B.A. degree in Chemistry from Marietta College in 1960. In between these academic stints, Story worked as a mathematician and operations analyst for Kodak Film in New York.After that got boring, he decided to become a doctor. He completed an M.D. from Columbia University in 1964, and an M.S. in Physiology and Biophysics from the University of Kentucky in 1966 (for good measure). Story practiced on a part-time basis at Denver General Hospital and was an instructor of physiology and biophysics at the University of Kentucky. During this time, he wrote or co-authored twenty five scientific papers in the areas of aerospace medicine and physiology.Logically, Story decided it was time to go to space and become an astronaut. And so he did. A veteran of six space flights, Musgrave has spent a total of 1,281 hours, 59 minutes, 22 seconds on space missions, including nearly 27 hours of EVA. He is also the only astronaut to have flown on all five Space Shuttles, and was one of the oldest people to ever orbit the earth, at the tender age of 61.Bonus: Somehow, during all of this, Story managed to fit in one last degree in Literature from the University of Houston in 1987.

did ben affleck shine more than christian bale as batman	no fanboys please but who was the true batman christian bale or ben affleck	1	Christian Bale, without a doubt.Before all the Bat-Fleck fans out there start raging out there, yes, I know the direction was crappy from The dawn of justice and that might be the reason for Ben Affleck’s appalingly dull portrayal as our favorite superhero. Nevertheless, had it been Christian Bale in his place, he would have pulled it off will all the awesomeness that Batman really is.See, in the Dark Knight Trilogy, Batman was cool, composed and amazing. Yes, most credit goes to Nolan’s direction of the film and the glorious effects. But Bale knew how to pull it off, he didn’t bring out a wimpy, talkative aid to Batman’s character like Affleck so negatively did.And yes, people would say that Affleck’s portrayal was like the “real batman” as in the one in the comics but in that case it is wrong as well. Affleck’s portrayal of the “real Batman” was quite not upto the mark either. “The real Batman” was played perfectly only by Michael Keaton in the 1989 movie.Affleck was neither here nor there. He really just blew the whole thing up. His action was so dull, I literally stopped watching Dawn of Justice midway. On the other hand, to this very day, I watch the Dark Knight trilogy over and over again.To add to my answer, I have a bit of proof here:The first image is to prove that I didn't google for “Christian Bale the best Batman or something like that”Business Insider is a plausible site and also the first option that google gave. So, take a look:So, there you have it! Clearly Bale is the better Batman.

In order to become the rightful husband for Nagnajiti, one had to tame the seven bulls of Nagnajita. Although many had failed to so, Krishna did the task easily and was received Nagnajiti’s hand in marriage.Mitravinda – She was the cousin of Lord Krishna, who would actually have married Kaurava prince Duryodhana. Balarama knew that Mitravinda secretly loved Lord Krishna and so he advised Lord Krishna to abduct and marry her.Bhadra – Bhadra is the seventh wife of Lord Krishna, who was daughter of King Dhrishtaketu and his wife Shrutakirti. Her five brothers including Santardana had married Bhadra off to Lord Krishna.Lakshmana – Lakshmana was the daughter of the king of Madra, who had held a swayamvar in order to find a suitable partner for Lakshmana. Duryodhana and Jarashanda were also present at the swayamvar buty they all lost to Krishna’s skill.Rohini: She is sometimes considered as Jambavati, other scriptures mention her as one among 16100 wives and as chief among themThe 16000 wives were Gandharv yaksha and deva maidens kidnapped by Narakasur and kept captive. Since they had lived with Narakasur there families and society would not accept them back and therefore Krishna married them.Source - Names of wives of Lord Sri Krishna & little storiesTHANK YOU FOR READING. :)	Hari om, you are asking a question as to : “ Who Is the father of Lord Krishna?”.Hari om.“Vasudeva”, son of Surasena is the father , and “Devaki” the daughter of Ugrasena and sister of “Kamsa” is the mother of Lord Krishna.He was a born Kshatriya. That is why Lord Krishna is also known as Vaasudeva.Lord Krishna was born in the jail where his mother( Devaki ) and father (Vasudeva ) were being kept in the prison by the Kamsa.Soon after his birth, Bala Krishna was moved to “Nandavrajam” where he was brought up by his foster mother “Yashoda” and foster father “Nanda”, who were Yadavas.So, Lord Krishna was also known as Yadunandana. However, he is a born Kshatriya.Not knowing the truth ( infact nobody knew the truth that, Bala Krishna was actually born in the prison to Devaki & Vasudeva, Duryodhana used to tease Lord Krishna as belonging to Yaadava ccommunity which was not recognised as a Kshatriya community.Hari om.

what is the work of an executive recruiter like	what is it like to work with an executive recruiter	0	An executive recruiter usually recruits for management positions like CFO, CEO and CRO. Which means when they search for these candidates, their strategy is a lot more discreet and strategic. They might target specific individuals and go out and headhunt them. Most executive recruiters work on a retained search which means they also provide market maps, prepare specific portfolios about potential candidates. This can be very detailed from the candidate's interest to their personal expectations and salary packages. 	An executive recruiter usually recruits for management positions like CFO, CEO and CRO.

which psychological need does collecting fulfill	why do people collect things	0	To start - there is evidence that “collecting” is as nearly old as man.  We find gold ornaments in prehistoric graves.  King Tut had paddle dolls which were absolutely a “collection”  from when he was a young child.  Julius Caesar collected coins.  A massive mosaic was found Greece archaeologists uncover Amphipolis floor mosaic - BBC News  from 400 BCE, and on and on.The need is driven in the workings of the human mind - in an attempt to find order in the world, collecting items which fit in an ordered world makes sense.  No one ”collects” one butterfly, one gem, one painting and one axe - people collect items related to each other.And so collecting is a golden clue into how people actually think.(Derived from having read literally millions of messages on the topic of collecting)	Jim Halperin, a noted coin and comics collector, lists the following underlying motivations in his article Why Do We Collect Things?...Knowledge and learningRelaxation and stress reductionPersonal pleasure (including appreciation of beauty, and pride of ownership)Social interaction with fellow collectors and others (i.e. the sharing of pleasure and knowledge)Competitive challengeRecognition by fellow collectors and perhaps even non-collectorsAltruism (since many great collections are ultimately donated to museums and learning institutions)The desire to control, possess and bring order to a small (or even a massive) part of the worldNostalgia and/or a connection to historyAccumulation and diversification of wealth (which can ultimately provide a measure of security and freedomYou can read more here...

how can i become more fluent in chinese	how can i become fluent in chinese	1	In my view, the only way you can become fluent in Chinese is to use it, massively and consistently, in real communication with real people through everyday real life activities, like:conversations, dialogues, meetings, discussions, presentations, sales pitches, writing emails or reports or proposals, weblogging, webcasting, podcasting, etc.,Your verbal facility and conversational fluency in the language can only come by doing so, with sweat equity of intense efforts and focused execution.	This is a technique known as 'shadowing' that I learnt in Japanese class, which I find tremendously helpful for short-term oral fluency improvement.Watch your favorite English language TV show or movie, and as the characters speak, repeat loudly the exact words they are saying the moment you hear them. In other words, 'shadow' their dialogue in real-time. Don't worry about getting every word or sound right - focus on listening carefully, moving along quickly and keeping pace. After the movie ends, repeat the exact same movie and do it again. And again.By forcing yourself to speak at native speed, your brain becomes hyper-receptive to what you are hearing, and you will find yourself not only picking up the words quicker and quicker, but also unconsciously mimicking the inflections and vocal nuances that are usually difficult to learn for a non-native. It will also fix the stammer that comes with uncertainty or lack of confidence. In this way, the actors in the movie become your speaking partners.This will be perfect practice just before your interview. Look for some interview practice videos on YouTube, then shadow the entire conversation. Practice the same dialogs again and again. You will be amazed how that will improve not only your speaking, but also your ability to actively listen and react. Best of luck.
what are the effects of demonetization of 500 and 1000 rupees notes on real estate sector	what will be the impact of scrapping of  nonascii 500 and  nonascii 1000 rupee notes on the real estate market	1	I strongly disagree with most of the answers here. Don’t let “so called economists” mislead you who says after demonetization of 500/1000 rupees notes, the real estate sector will go down, without correcting your facts.People are claiming that real estate industry involves the maximum amount of black money, and as there will be shortage of black money after government’s bold decision, the demand for the properties will reduce. And as the demand supply graph works, lower demand means lower prices. The thing you are missing here is, real estate sector is not just about black money and pricing system in an industry is not just about demand and supply relation.We can divide this industry in majorly two parts to understand the effects of currency ban:1. Agriculture land and individual plots: These are the two types of properties which might see the downfall.These properties are generally bought long back with a very lesser amount compared to the present rates, so the prices of these two types of properties are completely depended on the market value. So if the market value of any property decreases, automatically the price of that property will decrease. Now since these properties involve the maximum amount of black money, shortage of black money will reduce the number of potential buyers from market, reducing market value, finally reducing the prices.2. All the other type of properties (Commercial office spaces, apartments, developer plots, villas etc.)These types of properties involve negligible or no black money. So the reduction of black money will have minimum effect on the demand of these types of properties.Secondly prices of these are not just depended on the market demand. A huge amount is first invested by builders to develop the property. So in these cases margins on invested amount plays a major role in deciding the property’s price. Since the real estate market has already been witnessing recession since last 3 years, builders have reduced their margins to the lowest. So there is no further scope of price reductions as no businessman will sell his product with a loss. The prices may stay still, but will not see downfall for sure.The mentioned points are the cases when the demand stays the same as before or goes down. But we should notice here that since the banks will be flooded with cash after government’s decision of demonetization of 500/1000 rupees notes, the loan process will be eased and the interest rates will be reduced. These properties were already being transacted without any black money, and now since there would be easy home loans at lower interest rates, demand of these properties might even INCREASE.So guys please correct your facts and stop believing everything you read. This time is the best time to buy property. The prices may not go up in a short span, but these will not go down for sure.	I strongly disagree with most of the answers here.

what is the easiest way to become a billionaire dollar 	what is the best way to become a billionaire	1	I was raised with a lot of privilege. I’m not trying to deny it. But you know what the massive side dish is that comes with privilege? Delusion. You always expect more food to magically appear on your plate, without so much as leaving the table.One of the most common, yet most dangerous illusions my generation secretly indulges in is the idea of becoming a billionaire.Go ahead. Feel it. Deep down. It’s there.“I’ll become a billionaire.”As if it was just a matter of when. If you just felt a slight tingle, I have a few questions for you. Questions for future billionaires.1. What’s your good reason for wanting to make a billion?I like David Blaine’s idea that success is giving as much as you get.He says what makes Bill Gates so great is that he’s figured out how to give the money he’s amassed to worthy causes better than most institutions can. Polio’s almost eradicated. Next, he’s going after Guinea worm disease.If the only place you want to direct the money is into your own pocket, you’ll never think broad enough to reach a billion.“To make a billion dollars, help a billion people.” – Peter Diamandis2. What’s your real reason for wanting to make a billion?Now that we’ve got the noble cause out of the way, why do you really need the money? What happiness can a billion buy you that 100 million can’t? That 10 million can’t? That one million can’t?It’s just another arbitrary number. What’s not arbitrary is the psychological hole you’re hoping it’ll fill. Where’s the hole?Are you insecure? Lonely? Do you lack self-worth? Self-love? Who do you want to prove wrong? Yourself? The world?It’s okay. Just like the idea of becoming a billionaire itself, when you dig deep enough, you’ll realize it’s there. We all have it. But know it’s there.“There’s always a good reason and there’s always a real reason.” – James Altucher3. How are you going to make your billion?Seriously. Do the math. The real, serious math. We’re not talking about revenue here. We’re talking about profit. Profit you can pocket.What does a billionaires bank account even look like? Is there ever a billion on there? I have no idea. And neither do you.Only 3% of billionaires made their money from running private companies. Can you take a company from zero to IPO? How big is your total market? Is there even a billion in there?“If past history was all there was to the game, the richest people would be librarians.”– Warren Buffett4. Who’s going to make your billion for you?That’s right. Not with you. For you. You have to be aware that in the end, that’s what’s happening. Everyone you hire along your journey will partly be responsible for making your billion. And you will hire people. You have to.These people will work with you. But they’ll make money for you. Tell me: Why should they? Tell them. You better have a compelling reason. A good offer.What are you going to give back? What are you going to do for them?“Help young people. Help small guys. Because small guys will be big.” – Jack Ma5. When do you expect your billion?If the answer is anything less than 20 years from now, you can stop right here. Warren Buffett became a millionaire just before turning 30. He first was a billionaire at 56. That’s 26 years, starting from millionaire status.Are you a millionaire yet? No? Whoops. That’s just the first part. But even that’s ridiculously hard.And don’t you dare tell me about Mark Zuckerberg. You’re not Mark Zuckerberg. Mark Zuckerberg isn’t reading this. Neither would you be, if you were already seriously working on your billion.“I’m here to build something for the long-term. Anything else is a distraction.” – Mark Zuckerberg6. What are you willing to give up for your billion?If being a billionaire is your number one goal, think about number two. You will not get number two. Or three. Or four. The bigger the goal, the bigger the sacrifice.0.0000272% of all humans are billionaires. They gave up not one, but all the things that make the other 99.99% of people what they are - the other 99.99% of the people.Whatever you think you can also have, next to being a billionaire, you most likely can’t. We’re not talking about giving up watching football here.Are you willing to be a bad father for your billion? An absent mother? Are you willing to lose your girlfriend? Or all your friends? Would you give up family? Sleep? Food for a week?Most importantly: Are you willing to give up being understood by every single person you know?“I was set free, because my greatest fear had already been realized, and I was still alive, and I still had a daughter whom I adored, and I had an old typewriter and a big idea. And so rock bottom became the solid foundation on which I rebuilt my life.” – J.K. RowlingPrivilege is a sweet syrup. There’s lots to gain from savoring it. Delusion is the bitter taste it leaves in your mouth when you get used to it.So here’s one last piece of bark to chew on. As of 2017, there are 2,043 billionaires in the world.How many of them do you think started with dreaming about being a billionaire?Sources[1] Fear{less} with Tim Ferriss[2] 2015 Gates Annual Letter[3] American Billionaires And Their Private Company Fortunes[4] The Age When 17 Self-Made Billionaires Earned Their First Million[Image] Warren Buffett is 'one-quarter Coca-Cola'PS: I write more articles like this one each week and send them out in Nik’s Newsletter.

They gave up not one, but all the things that make the other 99.99% of people what they are - the other 99.99% of the people.Whatever you think you can also have, next to being a billionaire, you most likely can’t. We’re not talking about giving up watching football here.Are you willing to be a bad father for your billion? An absent mother? Are you willing to lose your girlfriend? Or all your friends? Would you give up family? Sleep? Food for a week?Most importantly: Are you willing to give up being understood by every single person you know?“I was set free, because my greatest fear had already been realized, and I was still alive, and I still had a daughter whom I adored, and I had an old typewriter and a big idea.

are there people who are willing to give free lectures or conduct free workshop in india colleges	almost two weeks in on prozac why do i still feel antisocial and still do not  want to go to events why does my social behavior and mood change daily	0	There was this tech fest at NIT Trichy. We registered for a workshop on ‘Quadcopters’. The description given was ‘Hands on training’ with a takeaway kit.<Similar to the one they show in 3 idiots>The workshop was offered by a private company. The company even promised to support us with advancements and developments after the workshop through regular emails.The fee for the workshop was 6000 Rs. for 5 people (as a team). It was for two days.We went earlier and the crowd there was overwhelming.2 freakishly dressed guys entered the hall.They introduced themselves as teachers.The morning session was a lecture on aerodynamics and how airplanes worked. By lecture, I mean the guy was reading from his PowerPoint slides. Not more than 10% of the class listened to it. Aahhh, even if you teach in Gibberish language, I'll listen to it. I've paid.The afternoon session started with distributing the kit for the quadcopter. 2 wooden planks were given to make the chassis of the quad (the base frame) . They explained nothing. They said to drill holes at specific points and to fasten the two wooden planks with screws. We screwed.That's it. The day was over.Next day, they gave us a microcontroller and the sensors. I was eager for this part. Coding for a quadcopter felt awesome.They gave us some files in a pendrive. It had the code. They told us to just upload the code.What ? That's it ? No programming ?They then made us wait for a few hours.We were still excited for the next part. Assembling a battery, the motors, the blades, the remote control and all.They made all of the teams to sit near the ground outside the hall. The teams were called one by one. After 3 hours of doing nothing, our turn came.They had only one set of motors, battery and the remote control for more than 200 students.A team of 3 guys, who were also dressed freakishly, asked for our chassis. They assembled the motor, the wings, the battery and everything. We simply had to watch it.Why on earth is this called a hands on workshop ?We dreamt of atleast flying it. That's when they poisoned our dreamsA guy who held a remote control, made the quad fly.“Students, your quadcopter is flying. Take video guys”, He said to us.I was furious. We did not pay to take a video. We paid to learn how to do it.It did not end there. They issued us certificates. Most students left.We were waiting for the takeaway kit. When we asked them, they said to take the wooden planks alone.Even worse is their continuous support through email. I've received 7 mails from them so far. One of them was a digital certificate and the other 6 were ads for their next workshops.The students didn't demand anything from them, as they got an NIT workshop certificate. I still have no clue, what on Earth are they going to do with that certificate.These private companies use the 'Workshops are conducted in IITs and NITs' tag to make money from other college students.In an era where, Khan Academy and Unacademy are giving free courses to students, some people tend to make money out of students' ignorance and curiosity.The colleges where the workshops are hosted should take efforts to ensure certain quality parameters.This scam on a scale across all the colleges in India would amount proportional to the other 'well to do' scams in our country.Edit 1 : Whoa. From the comments, it seems a large number of people were affected by this scam.Jayasuriya Rs	No, all it does is make serotonin more available in your brain for a while, and maybe alter other neurotransmitters (aka “chemical messengers”) in your nervous system. Of course, your nervous system affects and is affected by all your other systems, and your environment, so it’s all very complex. What taking Prozac feels like depends on unique things about you and your life circumstances, and as you’ve surely noticed, we are all very different.Be as honest and clear with the doctor who prescribed it. If there’s no benefit from being on it, the wise thing might be to stop taking it. Much has been written about reasons NOT to use antidepressants, with some very fine minds concluding they don’t have any benefit, or don’t have enough benefits to justify the problems with side effects and difficulty (physical, cognitive, and emotional) after people stop taking them.A non-drug-oriented counselor might help you discover whether you have some maladaptive beliefs about social events and dating that are keeping you away from them. People don’t judge each other as harshly as we sometimes think they do. Remember that other people are shy and self conscious too. If you find yourself feeling nervous at a gathering of some kind, you can ease your suffering by finding another nervous or shy person and starting a conversation. You don’t have to march up and stare at them and bark out a direct question. It’s more a matter of being beside them at the punch bowl, samovar, or keg and making a small attempt to communicate. This is doing them a favor, a selfless act on your part, even if it is difficult for you. Ask them if they like parties. They’ll probably laugh out loud and say “NO! Do you?” and then you’ll laugh, and you’re off to the races. You’ll be “that nice person I talked to at the party,” not “that shy person no one talked to.”
what  the best way to start learning robotics	what is the best way to start robotics which is the best development board that i can start working on it	0	Hi, I unapologetically am copy and pasting this answer I've been posting over Quora because I believe it gives a good answer, motive, and inspiration for starting robotics. Following this stream of development will land you to a solid position in the future. Most people will suggest Arduinos, here is my argument against that.*** Self advertisement as this gets over 2k views/week (Edit): I’m now taking on contract development work! Message me if you have opportunities available. (noobaca2@gmail.com) *** Thank you and continue on to the post!I wish I could post the same answer as i did to another post. But contrary to what all these old folk are saying about robotics, Arduinos are NOT robotics! Just because you know how to program a microcontroller or know how an analog circuit works, doesn't mean you know diddly squat about robotics, the software architecture (which is a fancy two word thing for saying how the main ideas of a robot can fit together in a puzzle)An Arduino will not:- show you how to integrate multiple sensor and data feeds- actuate sequences of motorcontrollers via inverse kinematics solutions- do autonomous navigation by bringing together many low level peripherals- teach you about differential drives required to move a mobile baseWhat an Arduino is:- a tool for communicating with peripherals.- limited, stupid, a basic input output board (just like the people who talk about how they're also a robot)If you keep going down the route that all of these baboons on Quora I keep for some reason saying go down about Arduinos, Microcontrollers, PLCs, etc, you will end up just like them.. 30 years later and still having not built an actual robot.Now, I'll copy and paste what I've been throwing around out here a lot:No, Arduino is not a good place to learn robotics. Sure, you will learn how to control a servo or blink an LED. This is not robotics, it is programmable logic. If you think learning how to program an Arduino is going to teach you how to make a robot, that is equivalent to saying learning how to write a mouse driver is going to teach you how to build a computer.You will want to look at the Robot Operating System and begin with the tutorials there (see rest of post for links) You will want to get familiar with simulators Tutorials : Installation, real world architectures vs simulation architectures.. etc, and work from a top down view.The robot operating system Powering the world's robots is a essentially a filesystem that will let you organize all of your robotics code.Why start with software, and not hardware? In simulation, and with the way the Robot Operating System is organized, you WILL learn how to interface with simulated controllers and how to actuate simulated robots, and be able to put entire systems together. A long story short, a robot is essentially a local area network of sensors and actuators connected by physical joints in usually, a tree like structure. You will shortly realize that Arduino is just a device used to communicate to hardware, and the real stuff is done by learning the ideas that software organizes.With the Robot Operating System, I have learned to program and write software for the PR2 robotThe Husky Mobile manipulation robotand the Talos mobile manipulation system being developed at UBC Open RoboticsThe only time I have ever encountered an Arduino was because we needed to interface with a motor for the mobile base in the Talos robot. It was like 100 lines of code out of a 10k+ LOC project. Most importantly, you should start with something small and keep prying.I would start with the very thorough Turtlebot tutorials which can be run in simulation, found at: Learn TurtleBot and ROSYou can even get the Husky Mobile Manipulation robot up and running which will get you an arm moving around in simulation (you can whack things!) husky_ur5_moveit_config/Tutorials/Husky UR5 Mobile ...	The best way to start learning robotics is to learn concepts like, what is forward and inverse kinematics, trajectory planning, dynamic analysis, path planning !I read this book first from my college library that made me understand the math behind manipulators: https://www.amazon.com/Introduct...Then I started using Arduino UNO to learn how to control servo motors, stepper motors and DC motors. You can find more on this page:Once you are done with them, try making a simple 2R robot and make it write alphabets !
why do people hate hillary clinton	what are the reasons that people dislike hillary clinton	1	As a woman in politics, you’re expected to be tough. Otherwise, you’re just a girl, and you should go back to cooking, or whatever.Hillary Clinton’s persona took that toughness to a new level.The result is that she doesn’t make anyone feel warm and fuzzy inside.I’ve penned more than my fair share of Hillary Clinton defenses on here, but she never excited me. And I have some residual anger at her, left over from the racist campaign she waged against Obama in 2008.The North remembers.In any case, people dislike her for different reasons:It’s hard for people to see it that way now, but many on the right saw her as unacceptably liberal. She was the poster child for a certain kind of unapologetic feminism. You can see it here in her “could have stayed home and baked cookies” statement, given in response to a rude question from a reporter:There were all kinds of right wing conspiracy theories against the Clintons in the 90s. When people are subjected to such a barrage of negativity, a perception that some of it must have been deserved sets in. The barrage of conspiracy theories against Hillary basically never stopped. It’s impossible to be an American Conservative and not have absorbed at least some of it.She is a pragmatist. If she supports gay rights but the rest of the country doesn’t support it, she’ll support advancing gay rights as far as politically feasible. She’s not going to campaign on idealism that she has no chance of enacting into policy. Some people view that as exceedingly calculating and untrustworthy.She is very pro-military intervention. A lot of people on the left dislike that.She is too comfortable with the big Banks. A lot of liberals, especially those of my generation, really, really, really don’t like that.I think those are the main reasons, as I see it.	"From an anonymous article I recently read on Politicall (link below), this is the best answer I've seen to your question.Consider for a moment that we hate Hillary Clinton because of who she is, what she has done and it has nothing to do with her gender, not even anything to do with the republican delusion syndrome. I’m going to say it right here and now I hate the Clintons. Both her and Bill and I'm never going to apologize for it. I hate what they did to the democratic party handing the party of the people over to the same corporate masters as the republican party and taking away real choice in the general election. I hate that they dismissed and belittled progressives rendering our causes futile or simply off the table. I hate them for welfare reform and a draconian crime bill that victimized the poor, destroyed entire neighborhoods and disproportionately crushed communities of color. I hate them for trade deals that destroyed the middle class, killed American jobs and sent wages on a race to the bottom. I hate them for de-regulating the media and then ducking behind them for cover on their lies and smears of their political enemies. I hate them for passing Don’t Ask Don’t Tell and DOMA and pretending later that they were doing it to save the gay community from something worse. I hate them for saying they want America to take the lead in fighting global warming then taking huge donations from the oil and coal industries, selling fracking to the world, supporting offshore drilling, supporting the extraction and storage of natural gas and opposing a carbon tax… basically the exact opposite of what someone who cares about stopping or slowing global warming would do. I hate them for being the dirtiest campaigners in modern history. I hate her specifically because her foreign policy of war, regime change and arming the enemy of our enemy has been almost as destructive as Dick Cheney arguably one of the most destructive leaders in our nation’s history.  Yes I hate them and my hatred for them grows with every lie, with every smear and with every media hit piece or every surrogate that goes out spreading lies and false narrative on their behalf. Yes I hate them for who they are and what they have done, I don’t hate them because the republicans told me to hate them. I don’t hate her because she is a woman. I hate them because they have done more damage to progressives and progressive ideas while pretending to be progressive than any republican ever could have. I hate them for manipulating other democrats into being their apologists and attacking anyone who didn’t agree with them or called them on their record or questionable integrity. In ‘92 they promised us that they were a 2 for 1, she then became the only first lady to set up an office in the west wing, but how dare anybody hold her accountable for the damage of their administration. Sure she wants the credit for the short term prosperity that came with the dot com bubble, but doesn’t want any of the blame for the long term consequences of their wall street deals, free trade agreements, mass incarceration or any of the things I listed above. In 92 they said that they were representing the centrist wing of the party and were ""new democrats"" leading the party into a new era, a third way with centrist democrats who could beat republicans in both the money game and electoral game… and they they did exactly that, dragging the party to the center, crushed the left and led to a corporatist takeover of the party, a party that now answered to corporate interests but how dare anybody who remembers the left bring that up.Well I admit that I hate them… but somehow as a defense Hillary says if we hate her, surely we must hate Obama for taking money from wall street, or Kerry or insert name of virtually any corporatist third way Democrat.  But wait I don’t hate Obama. 8 years ago I was doing what her supporters are attacking me for now by defending Obama against her lies, smears and attacks. I defended Obama when she sent out her surrogates to smear him, tell us that he can’t get anything done, has no experience and has no idea about foreign policy because he disagreed with her hawkish ways. Thanks to their corporate takeover of the democratic party I’ve been forced to support the lesser of two evils every election at nearly every level of government and yes I hate that and blame them. I hate that us progressives have been mocked and dismissed every election cycle while being told that this endless string of middle right corporate democrats are progressive… but sadly I remember what progressives fight for and against. I remember what it was like when democrats put the people first and answered to the people. I know it makes me angrier but I watched all of this happen in real time and yes I was paying attention. I can’t pretend to not know what democrats used to get for us and can’t pretend to not notice that our party has been hijacked.So here we are in the primaries in a year when millennials and Independents along with progressives and yes the fringe racist right are all rising up and demanding representation. We are mocked by the media, ignored by the media and scolded by the establishment desperate to hold onto the power they stole from us. We are scolded for ignoring their dirty games, conventional wisdom and establishment bullying. I’ve been involved in progressive politics for 25 years and I know this is the primaries. I know what that means,  this is when we get to decide the direction of our party. This is when we get to choose someone who represents real positive change and not the least offensive of the corrupt two party system. This is when we get to remember we have a democracy and that our leaders probably could and should represent the interests of the people.This is when we can send the Clintons into retirement and let both them and their corrupt corporatist leaders know that we are done with oligarchy (a small group of people having control of a government) and plutocracy (government by the wealthy elite and ruling class), we are ready to get our democracy back. This is when we refuse to take no for an answer, when the people can be told she is 20 points up 2 days before the vote and that it’s over, but they decide to ignore the media noise, ignore the party insiders and send Bernie to one of the biggest primary upsets in political history. This is when we can embrace real change. This is when we can ignore the so called experts that say because she crushed it in southern red states that there is no path to victory for another democrat even though most states including virtually every large state has still not voted. I don't ever want to be told I have to vote for the lesser of two evils.This is when we save democracy, save our planet and remind democrats of our progressive past. This is when we defeat  Hillary Clinton and not because she is a woman, but because she is a wolf in sheep’s clothing who has done enough damage and we are done with both the Bush’s and the Clinton’s. This when we start a political revolution that wins back our party, wins back our government, wins back American jobs and restores the American dream. This is when we embrace a truly inspirational leader like Bernie Sanders and we turn the page on a 4 decade attack on the American people by the people we called our leaders. This is when we remind ourselves and the younger generations what it’s like to be truly great again. Once in a lifetime a truly transformational leader comes along speaking the truth, inspiring the masses and changes the world. Let's not blow it. Vote for real change, vote for honesty and integrity, vote for vision and compassion. Vote for Bernie Sanders and don't let your party, your parents party or the media talk you out of it, or convince you it can't happen. Make it happen. #FeelTheBernIt’s not us, it’s her - And you can't shame us for not supporting Hillary, not in the primaries"
why are women who are on their periods are regarded as unclean such that they are prevented in taking an active part in rituals hinduism	why is it always expected that a woman should take care of housework children and cooking especially in indian culture are these activities the responsibility of women alone why do men not share equally in such work	0	Are classes that factor in participation during group discussions biased against those who are more thorough, yet slower, thinkers? (Such as the student wants time to develop opinions, yet once they make up their mind, the discussion has moved on.)	"In this era of globalization, we see both wife and husband are working full-time. Simultaneously running their houses with a great responsibility on their shoulders. without considering employment as an extra burden or a hindrance to raise their kids or to do household activities. To answer your question, I shall elucidate more on the accuracy of this statement.To begin with, we live in a world that's very fast moving and extremely competitive. So, as a result, resting is not an option for us. When it's very evident that in a family it's imperative to have both men and women work, on the other hand, it becomes equally crucial to have their household chores to be shared among them equally.Secondly, In my opinion, this way of sharing the household activities will not only help develop a great bond between husband & wife. Also, it helps in understanding each other's immensely and therefore it can give rise to another benefit of giving appropriate time to their kids at homes. Be it whatever task they are confronted with, the whole idea of having a companion and helping each other in their every day mundane stuff is the whole idea of starting a life together.For instance, let's take my own example where both my mother & father were full-time employees in government and private sectors respectively. Nevertheless, how much ever the circumstances looked crucial to them, never did they fail me or themselves in raising me or taking care of my dire needs by sharing their home-related activities in parallel.In a nutshell, I completely agree and support the statement that the ""household duties can and ought to be shared among men & women"" and there's absolutely nothing wrong in doing so whatsoever."
if atheism is the lack of belief in gods what is the term for the belief that there is no god	is atheism the lack of belief in gods or a claim that god does not exist	0	"There is no real difference between your two definitions. Atheism means ""lacking a belief in god"" because ""a"" means ""without"" and ""theism"" means ""belief in god"". Therefore it is generally considered more accurate (more respectful to the root of the word) to say ""without a belief"". To most atheists there is something awkward about saying you believe in a nullity. At the very best saying ""I believe there is no god"" is poor grammar. A bit like saying... ""Mum: do you not know where my socks are?""But if you lack a belief in god then you believe there is no god. The term is atheism for both your descriptions.   Hard AtheistIf someone believes there is no god with certainty then you could say they are a hard atheist. I sometimes use the term myself because it seems to mean something to people. Some atheists are likely to disagree with me about this, but even though I do use it myself, I think the term hard atheist is next to useless. Not useless as such; but next to useless - uselessish. I will come back to that point, and at the same time take issue with this idea that you can lack a belief in god with certainty.Gnostic AtheistI suggest you don't use this term. I would argue (am arguing) gnostic atheist is also being used incorrectly. Take for example the chart found in Jim Ashby's discussion of atheism and agnosticism on Quora's Atheist FAQ [1]. The chart suggests that a gnostic atheist claims to know god does not exist - i.e. has knowledge of it. That seems like a pretty awkward definition to me - and an even dumber position. Are there really any atheists like that? Agnosticism is the position that nothing is known, or can be known of the existence or nature of god. It's therefore true to say that if an atheist is certain there is no god, then you could not call them agnostic. The opposite, gnostic, means a person who thinks they do have knowledge of god. Sometimes you'll see the term gnostic atheist being used to mean ""an atheist who claims to know there is no god"". But that isn't truly what gnostic means (see below). Strictly speaking gnostic means ""knowledge of god"" - not, ""knowledge of no god"". The latter is - to me - an oxymoron.So I put my version of Barry Hampe's challenge out there: If you can present credible, objective, verifiable evidence that no gods -- supernatural entities associated with a religion -- actually exist, I'll immediately stop being an atheist and become a gnostic atheist.Wavering TheistsI'm not convinced lacking a belief in god can be on some weird scale of soft --> hard certainty. If you are an atheist , you are an atheist. What further definition is required? And why?You see, when you say ""does not believe in god with certainty"", I have to question what you mean by that. How certain? Absolute certainty would be a delusion for any rational person in my opinion. That would be a tipping point into insanity.The point atheists regularly make about this is pertinent, and so it bears repeating. To the same extent as any theist or sane person, I believe there can never be, and will never be, evidence for unicorns or dragons (to use the tired old examples). I believe we will never find an actual skeleton of a dragon in a cave with scorch marks. Would you call me an especially fervent disbeliever of dragons for that reason? Surely if someone thinks there may be dragons we would just call this wishful thinking?It's the same thing - my disbelief in dragons and unicorns and fairies and god. I don't have a special disbelief in gods because I'm an atheist. Just because there is a special word for that disbelief doesn't make it special to me. It makes it special to the billions of people who do believe in god. The word atheist only exists as a numbers game.So, I'm certain there are no dragons or gods (like you I hope) ...       ... but you never know. I'd prefer not have custard on my face. One day someone might fin..."	Question: Is atheism the lack of belief in gods, or a claim that god does not exist?Answer: This question has been asked repeatedly on Quora and the answers are always the same.  I will risk sounding rude by asking you why did you not search for this question before posting it as a question? I suggest you start by reading Rob and Mangesh Urankar answers as they are quite informative to the general perspective of Atheism. My answer is that Atheism does not have a definitive set of rules that all Atheists must abide to.  There are some Atheist that make a positive claim that no god or gods exists.  They base this on the probability (as shown by credible, verifiable and independently obtainable or observable contradictory evidence and the complete lack of supportive evidence) being so close to zero that the concept of a god is irrelevant. These would fall under the Gnostic Atheist label (although there are other labels as well and how one defines themselves is much more important then how others define or label them, including myself). There is another group of Atheist who would fall under the Agnostic Atheist label.  This is the group I would belong to.  As stated above, each individual has the absolute right to define this label as they see it in relationship to themselves not to others.  My personal definition, which I have posted on numerous questions like this one, defines my stance on this issue.   I do not claim knowledge that no god or gods do not exist (I accept the possibility that somewhere in this vast universe there could be an entity that would fit the basic definition of a god) but based on the contradictory evidence (credible, verifiable and independently obtainable or observable) and due to the lack of supportive evidence I see no reason to accept the existence of any god or gods (I accept that the Probability of the existence of any god is sufficiently close enough to zero to disbelieve a claim of its existence). The short version is I accept the possibility but not the probability that any god exists based on the above criteria of evidence, both contradictory and supportive. If pressed by an individual about a particular god, I ask for the attributes that they believe their god has.  I ask for proof of these attributes, not hearsay evidence from scriptural texts.  When they inevitably ask me if I can disprove their god(s) existence, I first say that the burden of proof does not lie with me as I am not making a positive claim just stating a lack of belief in their claim.  I will then say if I can disprove one attribute of their god as they described it to me, will they accept this as evidence that the god they described does not exist.  They may say yes but in truth they will not.  They have allowed their Truth to become their Perception.  It is relatively easy to take an attribute assigned to a god and offer concrete contradictory evidence but it is pointless to do so.  If there is a god or gods out there, they have no impact on our life's, they do not intervene and prevent negative actions from occurring (both natural events and events in their name) and thus they are completely irrelevant.  An irrelevant god is no better then a non-existent god. Now, as I stated above, other Atheist will describe their Atheism in accordance to their own stance.  Some will agree with my stance and others will take a different stance.  The only unifying statement that all Atheist have is that we do not believe the veracity of the Theist's claim that their god, among all the gods, is real and all other gods are false.
what is it like to be jack dorsey	what is jack dorsey like	0	"Jack was great. I loved working with him. And he also taught me an important management lesson.We worked together at Odeo, which is where Jack built the first version of Twitter. He was an engineer and I was his boss, the VP of Engineering.When I joined Odeo, most of the team was already in place including Jack. There was a lot of confusion about whether I was there to help scale the team or whether we were wrong and needed to start pivoting.I think we experimented with at least six different pivots.One of the problems with not having clarity was that it was really hard to manage that team. Several of them weren't getting along and were acting out. But I didn't know enough about what we were doing to just fire any of them.So I spent most of my time trying to massage people's egos.However, during all of this Jack was perfect. He came in early, got his work done, volunteered for work that other people didn't want to do. He had a strong sense of duty and would work on messy code in any language.There was a key piece of infrastructure that was hacked together by one of the founders. It ran on a single desktop computer sitting in our server cage. This thing broke all the time and Jack was the only one willing to fix it.Given that, I didn't really need to spend much time managing Jack. I supported a raise and voted him some bonuses. But mostly I was working with the other people because they were causing a lot of headaches.I spent enough time with those trouble people that I consider several of them friends. But they were difficult anarchists back then. One of them sent me an apology note years later. He found a photo from one of our standup meetings where he'd refused to stand. That was his idea of anarchy.And I think that's a big management lesson--it's easy to get sucked in to spending all your time with the hard cases. If I could do it over, I would have spent more time with Jack. It's not that he needed managing. But I think he could have had an even easier time getting his viewpoint across if I'd spent more time supporting him.I do have a couple of anecdotes about Jack from those days.He definitely had a sparse sense of design. You could tell he was already thinking about focus and simplicity, especially in his own life. He only owned a few things, but those things were all of the highest quality.One day I asked him for advice about a gift. I wanted to get my mom something cashmere. Jack's eyes lit up and he got very excited telling me about a boutique that specialized in cashmere. So I went to this boutique. It was deep in some alley--I never would have found this myself. And it was the most expensive clothing store I'd ever been in. The cheapest thing there was a pair of $200 cashmere mittens. That was Jack.The thing I don't remember is why we all thought Twitter was such a good idea. As I recall, we jumped on it really early, even before we had a prototype.I think part of the issue was that most of us weren't yet on Facebook. So we didn't have a way to keep in touch with our friends.So when we had a version that was friends and family only, we all had a magical experience of feeling connected to our friends.My job during the very early days of Twitter was mostly to keep massaging the issues with the engineering team. Twitter was too small to have the whole team working on it. We also didn't know if Twitter was going to be a real thing on its own. So my job was mostly to keep Jack safe from distraction. Once I had to yell at someone who had kept trying to check in fixes to the code. But mostly, I was organizing the rest of the team to work on other Odeo projects.A story that I've never seen told was about sailing.Rabble, one of the other engineers, had bought a boat and needed to sail it down the delta to a dock he was renting in Berkeley. He asked for volunteers and said it was supposed to take half a day. Jack and Noah volunteered to help him on a Saturday.When the three of them came to work on Monday they were beet red, dehydrated and looked like they'd been stranded on a desert island.They'd managed to run the boat aground.Jack, who actually knows how to sail, was below deck getting changed. And he could hear Rabble and Noah speculating about the signs they were seeing on the delta. ""10? What does 10 mean?"" ""5? What does 5 mean?""Boom. Five means five feet. The boat ran aground and they were stuck there for awhile. Everyone who came to help treated them like morons. But that was a great anecdote for that team. Noah and Rabble were up for winging it. Jack was up for adventure, but he never would have run aground because he was so detail oriented."	I was with a group of students who sat down with him for about an hour last November.  We were touring the Silicon Valley and meeting with a lot of founders and investors - including Jack Dorsey at Square.All of us students were seated around a conference table and chatting and joking with each other, but as soon as he walked in, the whole room went dead silent.  Usually, when we met with founders they would greet us as soon as they walked in, but he said absolutely nothing as he walked in and sat down at his chair. He just sat there and looked at us for a little while.When he finally started talking, he was very soft spoken and calm whereas most successful founders I've met are loud and animated.  But the weird thing is that he has this really powerful, magnetic presence.  I think everyone in the room was totally captivated by him.  If you ever talk to Mark Zuckerberg, it feels like talking to a regular person.  Not so with Jack Dorsey - he had this kind of charisma that I've never gotten from anyone else.
what are the best quoteslessons of the assassin  creed series	which assassin has the best robes in assassin  creed	0	"A select few quotes from the Assassin's Creed franchise are very profound indeed and leave a lasting impact in the minds of the audience. I'll quote them in the no particular order whatsoever (the ones in bold are my personal favorites):1. A good life (AC2)Federico: ""It is a good life we lead, brother.""Ezio: ""The best. May it never change.""Federico: ""And may it never change us.""(The music and title screen following it is an act of genius.)2. Ezio's last letter to Sofia (AC Embers)""When I was a young man, I had liberty, but I did not see it. I had time, but I did not know it. And I had love, but I did not feel it. Many decades would pass before I understood the meaning of all three. And now, the twilight of my life, this understanding has passed into contentment.""3. The Creed's maxim (AC1)""Nothing is True, Everything is Permitted.""4. Al Mualim quoting the Bible (AC1)""I applied my heart to know wisdom, and to know madness and folly. I perceived that this also was a chasing at the wind. For in much wisdom, is much grief, and he that increaseth knowledge, increaseth sorrow.""5. Ezio to Desmond (ACR)""Desmond? I heard your name once before Desmond, a long time ago. And now It lingers in my mind like an image from an old dream. I do not know where you are, or by what means you can hear me. But I know you are listening. (he leaves his weapons) I have lived my life as best I could, not knowing its purpose, but drawn forward like a moth to a distant moon. And here, at last, I discover a strange truth. That I am only a conduit for a message that eludes my understanding. Who are we, who have been so blessed to share our stories like this? To speak across centuries? Maybe you will answer all the questions I have asked. Maybe you will be the one to make all this suffering worth something in the end.""6. Arno's closing monologue (AC5 Unity)""The Creed of the Assassin Brotherhood teaches us that nothing is forbidden to us. Once, I thought that meant we were free to do as we would. To pursue our ideals, no matter the cost. I understand now. Not a grant of permission. The Creed is a warning. Ideals too easily give way to dogma. Dogma becomes fanaticism. No higher power sits in judgement of us. No supreme being watches to punish us for our sins. In the end, only we ourselves can guard against our obsessions. Only we can decide whether the road we walk carries too high a toll. We believe ourselves redeemers, avengers, saviours. We make war on those who oppose us, and they in turn make war on us. We dream of leaving our stamp upon the world... even as we give our lives in a conflict that will be recorded in no history book. All that we do, all that we are, begins and ends with ourselves.""7. Clay a.k.a. Subject 16 to Desmond in Animus island (ACR)""What is a man but the sum of his memories, we are the stories we live, the tales we tell our selves""8. ""Because no one else will!"" (AC3)Charles Lee: ""Even those men you sought to save have turned their backs on you. Yet you fight, you resist, why?""Ratonhnhaké:ton a.k.a. Connor Kenway: ""Because no one else will!""9. Ezio's signature homage (ACR)Ezio to the departed Altaïr: ""No books... no wisdom... Just you, fratello mio (my brother). Requiescat in pace, Altaïr.""10. Achilles' warning to Connor (AC3)""In your haste to save the world, boy, take care you don't destroy it.""11. Altair's parting words to Darim (ACR)Altair: ""Go son, go be with your family, and live well""Darim: ""All that is good in me, began with you father""12. The Templar meeting (AC3)Lee: ""I pray we one day rise above it.""Haytham: ""While you pray, I'll act.""13. From the cinematic announcement trailer (AC Rogue)Shay Patrick Cormac: ""Life's hardest choices are the ones that force you to question your own moral code.""14. Benjamin Church (AC3)""It's all a matter of perspective. There is no single path through life that's right and fair and does no harm.""..."	I've played almost every game, reviewed almost every robe extensively, and I have yet to find a robe that appeared more sophisticated than this, the Brotherhood mentor robe of Ezio Auditore da Firenze.
why is creativity important	why creativity is important	1	Let me explain this with a simple example. Creativity can be linked to coming up with different solutions for a problem. It is about understanding the Problems, not Solutions.Sometimes it pays to dig a little deeper to find out what your customers really need.A young man walks into a hardware store looking to buy a hammer, but they are sold out. “What did you need the hammer for?” asked the proprietor. The man looked at him quizzically. “To hammer in some nails of course. Why else would I want a hammer?”The store owner persists with another question. What were you trying to hammer in with the nails? “A shelf” the man replied. “Good” said the proprietor. Maybe these will be of use instead - we have a nail free wall glue in stock as well as free hanging shelves - would either be useful instead?So you see, the customer is satisfied and the shop keeper just was creative enough to sell his product.It is left to you as to how creative you can be. Creativity cannot be taught but you just have to let your thoughts flow!	Creativity can involve broadening the view of what is possible. This can help to address changes that are happening or will happen and help your business prepare for them. It can also help with problem solving. Alana Gerrand

how headphones work as an antenna to play fm radio channels on mobile phones why mobile companies does not  install the same inbuilt antenna on phones to be able to play fm without the headphones	why do not  phones have a builtin fm antenna	0	An antennae is a metallic conductor. Headphones are insulated metal wire with a coil surrounding a magnet at one end and a thick metal jack at the other. It works as an antennae by picking up the energy in a radio wave, an oscillating electric current, and supplying it to a tuner.FM radio works in the range of 85 - 100 MHz (approximately). Antennae length is proportional to the wavelength of reception. If the frequency is ~85 MHz, the antennae length would be around 35 inches(a quarter of wavelength for whip antennae). Most earphones are greater than or about that length and are a good alternative to an inbuilt antennae.Most mobile phone purchase includes basic earphones. Even if  cellphones include inbuilt antennae, user will be using earphones most of the time or at least they will have an option of using earphones. In such case either one of the two antennae- inbuilt or external earphone- will be serving the same purpose diminishing the inbuilt antenna's worth. Earphones are not optional, inbuilt antennas are.Inbuilt radio antennae will make a phone bulkier by few grams and would increase the thickness of the phone, not a desirable attribute for marketing.To know more about  antennae :Antenna (radio) (wiki article)Page on Howstuffworks (how radio works)Page on Public (an algorithm on minimum antennae length)Whip antenna (wiki article)Using headset as cell phone radio antenna. (electronics point forum)** There are some cell phones with inbuilt antenna like  Nokia 5030, Nokia X2-02 etc.	How do headphones work as an antenna to play FM radio channels on mobile phones? Why don’t mobile companies install the same inbuilt antenna on phones to be able to play FM without the headphones?
what are the best career growth technologies for automation engineers apart from automation tools	himalayan or duke ktm 200 for touring	0	As you have experience in testing you must be knowing that there are two aspects of software testing:1. Functional testing    Where we focus on the actual functionality of the software2. Non-functional testing    Where we focus on the non functional parameters of a software e.g. load testing, stress testing, performance testing.There are automation tools to cater the need of both the aspects.It is advisable to have a knowledge of both the kinds of tools.You can learn the following combinations:1. HP suit (vbsvript)QTP for functionalLoadrunner for non functional2. Open source (Java)Selenium for functionalJMeter for non functionalThese are the two most popular options as they have huge marker share and lots of job opportunities.Apart from these tools there are many other popular tools like IBM RFT(Java), Microsoft VSTS (c#).Now a days with the boom of mobile market, mobile testing is emerging, there are many options for mobile test automation. E.g. cucumber, robotium, silk test, appiumIt depends on your choice, the language you are comfortable with. Professional guidence is available for almost all of them. It is marginally less for mobile tools though.Open source tools can be learnt by your own and for fres. But for proprietary tools you will require licenced version.Before joining any classes for proprietary tools like qtp, RFT or vsts do consider this point as getting them on your home PC for practice is difficult.	Hi Sekar,Since you prefer a naked street bike, yes, Duke 200 is a best choice. But, considering your previous experience with Royal Enfield, Duke is completely different.My experience: I use Duke for commuting 40kms daily. Frankly, I would say that Duke is not that much comfortable. Yes that is because of the seat. But, I know this disadvantage before buying my bike. My needs are power and acceleration, which is abundant in the Duke.Also, I always drive alone, meaning without any pillion. So I don't have any problems with the pillion seat (upto now\U0001f609), the pillion seat is poor in design and will make your pillion feel uncomfortable. So, I would advice you to go for a test ride and then make an appropriate decision.Thank You.
what are the disadvantages of listing a company in nse	what are the benefits of listing a company in nse	0	Every company is in need of money to grow and expand its business. They can do this by going public, which means by issuing shares, which people can buy. This first issue of shares offered by the company to raise capital (money) is called as an Initial Public Offering (IPO). Thus, IPO is the means by which a company gets listed in the stock market (and hence in indices such as BSE and NSE).Every investor owning some shares gets the ownership of the company proportionate to the amount of shares the investor holds. The exchange where this company gets listed is the place where you buy/sell the shares of this company.By this point you may think that it is a win-win for a company to go public, and there are absolutely no drawbacks. But this is wrong. A company going public (getting listed in BSE/NSE) has its own drawbacks as well. Some of them are as follows:The most important drawback is that a company needs to disclose additional information to its investors. This may seem to be a small thing, but is a very big deal.They need to comply to a lot of rules and regulations chalked out by SEC (Securities and Exchange Commission). The cost of complying to these regulations is quite high and might be a pain for new companies.Added pressure of performing in the market limits the company to short term goals rather than long term big wins and growth.Company becomes answerable to a lot of people and faces scrutiny for its wrong doing or lack of performance. This happens because investors always want to make profits after they put their hard-earned money in the company.The penalty for any wrong doing becomes huge.Due to all these reasons, any company thinks 10 times before going public by means of an IPO.Hope this information helps.Happy investing!	The advantages derived by the management as a result of listing are many. Apart from the distinct advertising value, listing enables the management to broaden and diversify shareholding. It is the general consensus of opinion that a company with a broad-based share ownership is better suited for growth and stability than a company with shares concentrated in few hands.Advantages :A premier marketplaceThe sheer volume of trading activity ensure that the impact cost is lower on the Exchange which in turn reduces the cost of trading to the investor. NSE's automated trading system ensure consistency and transparency in the trade matching which enhances investors confidence and visibility of our market.VisibilityThe trading system provides unparallel level of trade and post-trade information. The best 5 buy and sell orders are displayed on the trading system and the total number of securities available for buying and selling is also displayed. This helps the investor to know the depth of the market. Further, corporate announcements, results, corporate actions etc are also available on the trading system.Largest exchangeNSE is the largest exchange in the county in terms of trading volumes.Unprecedented reachNSE provides a trading platform that extends across the length and breadth of the country. Investors from 191 centres can avail of trading facilities on the NSE Trading Network. The Exchange uses the latest in communication technology to give instant access from every location.Transaction speedThe speed at which the Exchange processes orders, results in liquidity and best available prices. The highest number of trades in a day of 11,260,392 was recorded on May 19, 2009.Short settlement cyclesThe Exchange has successfully completed more than 2800 settlements without any delays.Broadcast facility for corporate announcementsThe NSE network is used to disseminate information and company announcements across the country. Important information regarding the company is announced to the market through the Broadcast Mode on the NEAT System as well as disseminated through the NSE website. Corporate developments such as financial results, book closure, announcements of bonus, rights, takeover, mergers etc. are disseminated across the country thus minimizing scope for price manipulation or misuse.Trade statistics for listed companiesListed companies are provided with monthly trade statistics for all the securities of the company listed on the Exchange.Investor service centersSix investor-service centers opened by NSE across the country cater to the needs of investors.Nominal listing feesThe listing fee charged by the Exchange is much lower compared to the listing fees charged by other exchanges.SOURCE :NSE website
how many derivatives of an object  position with respect to time have to be continuous	when does drawing become fun	0	That’s an excellent question. But I doubt if it has an answer. Macro sized objects are made of atoms and molecules that behave somewhat independently. When you strike a billiard ball with a cue it doesn’t move as a whole, a shockwave passes through it so the atoms near the cue move first and the motion spreads through the ball. To a first approximation you might be able to imagine a single wave spreading out from the area of contact, but it’s probably a lot more complicated with interference from reflected waves resulting in fairly random vibrations that we call heat.Of course all this happens over such a short time period so we can usually approximate the blow as an impulse. A more detailed analysis gives us the average acceleration of the molecules over a tiny time interval. In that case the jerk would be indeterminate. With steady acceleration one could analyse the jerk, but there will be a maximum number of derivatives that can be analysed in practice.However, in the ideal world of the mathematician where rigid bodies are truly rigid there are no constraints. You can have instantaneous changes of velocity and nothing need be assumed continuous. That’s why impulses were invented (along with supersonic shockwaves where the air density changes suddenly). Although the ideal world doesn’t exist, that doesn’t mean it isn’t useful.	As a baseline it should always be. Drawing is great fun when you do it as a means of exploration; of your own mind, the medium, the concepts of form etc, however it can be a dread as well, in particular when you try to draw complex images without having the appropriate technique. Example: doodling is great fun. Trying to draw a realistic portrait of your crush while s/he is sitting expectantly waiting to see, is usually not.If drawing isn't fun, change the way you draw: if you're drawing as realistically as you can, taking eons to get the details and shades right, switch it up and try drawing people, trees, that cat, whatever in no more than one minute. Then again under half a minute. Once again in ten seconds. It's hard at first, but you improve fast, which is motivating.Try drawing caricatures, things with absurd proportions, multiple things on top of eachother: a whale that is a salad bowl when viewed from a different perspective, which is a dragon viewed from another. Escher is a master of this.Find artists you like within different styles, explore styles you don't like initially: why do others like it? Can you learn from their way of drawing, and leave out whatever it is that didn't appeal to you?Make mathematical drawings, ViHart is a great inspiration for this, and shamelessly promoting myself, I wrote a post about it. If you're only used to drawing people and fruit it might show some of the versatility of the medium.Bottom line let the pencil carry you along instead of trying to make it sketch out the miniscule details, and drawing becomes a lot more fun, and the drawings become a lot better, since they depict a genuine side of yourself, rather than an attempted copy of someone else. Don't be ashamed of drawing dicks either, it's not a maturity contest, it's just for fun.
is the neutron star made up of	is the neutron star made up of only neutrons	1	A Neutron star is a collapsed supernova remnant that is too large to be a White dwarf.  And not dense enough to become a Black Hole.In general, compact stars of less than 1.39 M☉ (the Chandrasekhar limit) are white dwarfs, whereas compact stars with a mass between 1.4 M☉ and 3 M☉ (the Tolman–Oppenheimer–Volkoff limit) should be neutron stars. The maximum observed mass of neutron stars is about 2 M☉. The smallest observed mass of a stellar black hole is about 5 M☉, though compact stars with more than 10 M☉ will overcome the neutron degeneracy pressure and gravitational collapse will usually occur to produce a black hole.[9] Between 3 M☉ and 5 M☉, hypothetical intermediate-mass stars such as quark stars and electroweak stars have been proposed, but none have been shown to exist. The equations of  state of matter at such high densities are not precisely known because  of the theoretical and empirical difficulties.It's thought that Neutron Stars are indeed composed almost entirely of neutrons, but may have 'quark soup' or other complexities.  They definitely exist and some of them are pulsars.  Too small to be White Dwarves - which are made up of collapsed matter, still normal atoms.  And not black holes either.This is not 100% certain.  Some time back, I saw a suggestion that all of the neutrons actually transmute to Strange Particles - see Strangeness.

i got a  87  gpa is it enough to get into top universities like harvard	is a  87  gpa sufficient to get into a top school	1	No. A 3.8 is fine. Harvard regularly accepts students with a 3.8. That may sound surprising because Harvard rejects students with higher GPAs, but a 3.8 isn’t much different than a 4.0, and most schools don’t have a 4.3 grading range.The 3.8 student may win out based on SAT scores, extracurriculars, awards, the essay, and personal factors.Even a student with a lower GPA will at least have the other factors looked at, though it may be a quick look. Say a student with a 2.5 applies. What?! Who would dare apply with such a low GPA??? Before rejecting the application, though, the admissions people might see that the student has an SAT of 1540 and spent two of his high school years doing fundraising projects to get medical care for his dad who had cancer, and working to help support the family.

what is a profitable way to trade binary options	what is binary options trading	0	To start, let’s be clear: you can make money binary options trading. It’s definitely possible to generate a consistent profit. Smart traders do it every day, executing binaries in everything from oil and gold to stocks and currency pairs.I’ll give you a few tips to get you started. By following these you can start earning money by trading:Learn how to read candlestick chartsStudy the past price activity of your chosen underlying assets.Watch and follow pricing trends.Don’t bet your mortgage payment.Get some experience before risking a sizable piece of your cash flow.Types Of People Trade Binary OptionsTry to identify the category that best describes you.The first is The Gambler. This individual approaches binary options trading in the same way he approaches a roulette wheel. To him, whether he profits or not is based entirely on chance (e.g. red versus black). Hence, he doesn’t look at candlestick charts, pays no attention to pivot points, and couldn’t care less about Fibonacci retracements.In the second category we find The Investor. This individual looks at trading binaries as a method to “juice up” the return on his investment portfolio. If someone were to ask him about the things he invests in, he might respond, “IBM, Google, muni bonds, and some binary options trading.” Investors often fail to realize the high degree of risk they assume as they chase the high returns advertised by binary options brokers.The third category is made up of traders who are realistic. These folks typically have experience, and are well aware of the risks associated with trading binaries. They also know that having a keen grasp of the assets that underlie the options, and a familiarity with certain aspects of technical analysis, gives them an edge. And with that edge, they know they can consistently make money trading binary options.Beware of scam binary option brokersFor more information on how to earn good money on Trading binary go to ……. Get Your Money Back From Binary Options Scams	Well, first of all, look how it works, and then I will tell why you should not try it at all.In classical binary options trading all you have to do is to determine whether the price of a stock or a currency pair will go up or down in a predetermined period. The Put and Call options stay at the core of the whole Binary Options trading process. That is why we will start with these two.Binary Options is a type of options, the basic rule of which is to identify the future direction of the asset price. Consider that you trade on EUR/USDAs you can see in the right side, we have two large buttons: Put and Call.Buying the Call optionIf you consider that the EUR/USD quotation will go above the Strike Price and will end this way at the Expiry Time, then you should buy the Call option and you will have a predetermined profit in case your forecast is correct. Now let’s see what are the Strike Price and the Expiry Time.The Strike Price is the price of an asset which was at the moment of entering the Binary Options market. In other words it is the current price that moves continually and once you buy Call or Put options, it becomes the reference that will determine your profit or loss. On the image above you will see that horizontal line representing the strike price.The Expiry Time is the period that defines when the option contract ends. In our case it is a 60 second trade, but you can set the Expiry Time to be an hour, a day, and get informed from larger timeframes, like M30, H1 or D1.As you can see from the image above, we entered the market and bought the Call option. You can see that the Expiry Time is 60 seconds (1), the invested amount is $10 (2) and the predetermined profit is 88% from investment (3). The vertical red line represents the end of the option and if at that point the price will stay above the Strike Price, then our trade was successful.Buying the Put option has the same principles, yet at this time the price should go down, which means below the strike price.Now, why you should not trade binary options?Most of the binary brokers out there are fraudulent and will exploit you until the balance reaches zero. You can read this material to understand that in many cases it is a scam: The wolves of Tel Aviv: Israel’s vast, amoral binary options scam exposedYou will see there how the brokers employ people who don’t have any idea about finance, how these employees become advisors and press clients around the world to make deposits, how the employees have fake names, biographies and stories, how the platforms use tricks to manipulate charts in their favors, how the brokers fraudulently assess their clients’ wealth in order to know how much they can take from them, and many other such things.I hope this helps!Regards,Bob ParkerHolborn Assets About Us
how do i utilize free time to avoid depression	can a person graduating from iims like lik and even the new iims like ranchi and trichy ever catch up to the graduates from abc and get a similar package	0	Best depression medicine in my view is to listen to soft and soothing music. You can watch those movies that you always wanted to but never had time.If you already play a musical instrument then you can try to compose a beautiful song.Another way to make yourself happy is to keep a pet at home. Playing with a puppy will make you happy.Little children can be another medicine for depression. Play with them. Help them in their studies or project work. Teach them for a fee. Busy mind doesn’t have time for depression.You can enroll for some language courses or online courses of your choice and interest. Use your free time to build a foundation for better future.	Case III: IIM L I K with IIM A B C.. They can catch up very easily or might end up at same stage by the end of their PG even. IIM T catching up with IIM L I K. Sooner or later they will be at same level. May be in the span of 5 years. IIM R will take time.Case II: IIM L I K with IIM A B C, It will take time. May be a period of 3–8 years. With good FMCG/Consulting/Financial Services Companies in place, a jump or two would keep them at par. IIM T and R will take very long time to catch up with IIM A B C in this category.Case I: Top 10 percent people of IIM L I K with IIM A B C. These students are the ones evolved as toppers after at least 18 months of good smart work and i don’t think there will be much difference between anyone in this category. Be it from IIM A B C OR L I K. Though there might be difference in package due to institute reputation at the beginning, it will be covered up in subsequent years. Not sure how many years it will take for people from IIM T or R.

how do i earn from quora	can i earn money on quora	1	Ah! If there ever were a question just for me, this one is is probably it.I’ve been making a significant, mostly passive income from Quora for about a year now. Admittedly, I only stumbled into it.I had only discovered Quora just a few months prior. I was working a summer internship in a city separate from most of my friends, so I had a lot of spare time on my hands. Having always been a voracious reader, Quora kept me up a bit too late many or most work nights that summer.At some point, I began to feel a little guilty learning so many amazing things from other people and not giving back myself. So, I started writing answers to questions in the e-commerce and distribution space. I had been working independently in e-commerce for 8 years, and my internship was at a Fortune 200 distribution company.It’s worth noting that the thought of putting so much effort into writing these posts with the potential to reach tens, even hundreds of thousands of people made me super nervous at first. The first few times I hit submit, I immediately stood up and paced around a bit to shake it off.While most of my initial answers received very little attention, one blew up. The response (upvotes, comments) was tremendously positive. It was a great feeling.Around the same time, I was also reading quite a bit about affiliate marketing. I knew what it was all about from previous reading. After all, I had spent 8 years selling physical products online.For those of you not familiar, affiliate marketing allows you to make a commission selling other people and company’s products online, without actually fulfilling product orders or serving customers. You just have to make the introduction. You don’t have to be hired.

The software knows that buyer purchased after clicking your link.Finally, I decided to give it a shot. There were services I was already mentioning and linking to in my answers that had affiliate programs themselves, so I swapped my links out for affiliate links.Within 30 minutes, I made one $30 commission.I immediately did the math to calculate how much more money I would make that day. $30 every 30 minutes… 12 hours left in the day… Holy #$%^!!!I didn’t make a penny more that day. But over the course of the next couple weeks, I did quite well.As it turns out, you can’t just drop affiliate links wherever you please and without disclosure. It violates Quora’s policy, and disclosure of affiliate links is required by the Federal Trade Commission.This goes for most 3rd party platforms like facebook, LinkedIn, Medium, and reddit as well— even though you create and contribute the content yourself.Now, if you still want to make money from affiliate marketing on these platforms, the key is to build blogs relevant to what you are writing about. That way, you own the platform and what kind of links you post are up to my discretion (so long as affiliate relationships are disclosed).Then you can post really informative, helpful content on 3rd party platforms like facebook groups, Quora, and reddit to cultivate an audience. From that content you can link to supplementary resources on your blog where you are free to use affiliate links and earn commissions. If that content is great as well, people will continue to read your content, use your links to support you financially, and share with friends.Let’s explore an example of how this works in practice:Did you know many credit card companies offer 0% interest as an introductory rate for the first X months of having their credit card? Did you know credit card companies also pay hefty affiliate commissions for successful referrals?During my senior year of college, I was a little strapped for cash. I had money, but most of it was tied up in my online businesses and/or stocks. However, I had a job lined up for after graduation, so I knew I would have cash coming in soon.All of my friends were taking senior vacations. I didn’t want to ask my parents for money— they had covered enough.So, I opened a few credit cards with 0% interest for 6–9 months. During the second semester of my senior year, I partied through an online marketing conference in Vegas, visited a friend in NYC, went skiing in Colorado, searched for housing in KC, and spent a weekend at the lake.I paid the cards off in the first couple months after graduation using my salary.Now, it’s not the smartest financial decision I’ve ever made, but I’m not the only college student who would enjoy living it up a bit during senior year despite a lack of funds.How can I make money on that?Easy. Tell the story around Reddit, facebook groups, Quora, Medium… Link from those posts to a blog post titled something like “Top 10 Credit Cards Offering 0% Interest.” That blog post would compare the pros and cons of each, and link to applications using, you guessed it, affiliate links.

Recently, I did a podcast with Google Product Strategist, Sonali Mangal. As it turns out, getting a lot of exposure on Quora is a bit of a science. You can’t just write an answer and expect lots of views. Sonali and I discussed what works and what doesn’t on Quora. Listen here and enjoy!	Ah! If there ever were a question just for me, this one is is probably it.I’ve been making a significant, mostly passive income from Quora for about a year now. Admittedly, I only stumbled into it.I had only discovered Quora just a few months prior. I was working a summer internship in a city separate from most of my friends, so I had a lot of spare time on my hands. Having always been a voracious reader, Quora kept me up a bit too late many or most work nights that summer.At some point, I began to feel a little guilty learning so many amazing things from other people and not giving back myself. So, I started writing answers to questions in the e-commerce and distribution space. I had been working independently in e-commerce for 8 years, and my internship was at a Fortune 200 distribution company.It’s worth noting that the thought of putting so much effort into writing these posts with the potential to reach tens, even hundreds of thousands of people made me super nervous at first. The first few times I hit submit, I immediately stood up and paced around a bit to shake it off.While most of my initial answers received very little attention, one blew up. The response (upvotes, comments) was tremendously positive. It was a great feeling.Around the same time, I was also reading quite a bit about affiliate marketing. I knew what it was all about from previous reading. After all, I had spent 8 years selling physical products online.For those of you not familiar, affiliate marketing allows you to make a commission selling other people and company’s products online, without actually fulfilling product orders or serving customers. You just have to make the introduction. You don’t have to be hired. You just post a link to the product or service that is unique to you, and software tracks any sales that result from your recommendation. The software knows that buyer purchased after clicking your link.Finally, I decided to give it a shot. There were services I was already mentioning and linking to in my answers that had affiliate programs themselves, so I swapped my links out for affiliate links.Within 30 minutes, I made one $30 commission.I immediately did the math to calculate how much more money I would make that day. $30 every 30 minutes… 12 hours left in the day… Holy #$%^!!!I didn’t make a penny more that day.

what is my puk code	what  the puk for tf64simc4	1	Unless your network operator provides this information via a secure login on their website you won’t. You should have the PUK printed on any letter or paperwork that came with the SIM.The PUK is specific to your SIM card so the only way you can get it is to ask the company who manufactured your card (who won’t tell you!) , or the operator you got the card from (who will make you identify yourself before giving you this information).	I got locked out of my Idea SIM. It was asking for a PUK pass. What is the point of using a PUK when anyone can call to the service provider and get the PUK?
how can i find job in japan	how can i find an it job in japan	0	Do you speak Japanese?-If not, it will be terribly hard to find a job.Do you have a college degree?-If not, sorry. You won’t be able to find a job in Japan. You would be competing for entry jobs against people that are far more qualified than you, or Japanese people who take on part time work and are already there. If yes, keep reading:Are you American/British/Canadian/Australian and want to be a teacher?-If yes, you can look at the JET programme. But for the sake of the children, I’d advise you to only pursue this path if you honestly and truly want to be a teacher. Otherwise:Do you have experience in your home country?-If so, look in your industry, look for Japanese companies in that industry, see their recruitment page and apply. But this presumes you can speak Japanese, as most Japanese firms won’t even bother contacting you if you can’t speak the language.	"I work in a Japanese IT company.Really, all it takes is language proficiency and a reasonable amount of skills in the given area (or not at all if you apply as a fresher).Actually it's not hard science: there is a shortage of qualified human resources in the Japanese IT world. I'd say it's the easiest field for a foreigner to be hired.Even if your Japanese isn’t that good, some company are still willing to hire you. However I wouldn’t recommend it: you risk yourself to be categorized as a “cheap labor” which is highly unethical (but unfortunately common in some company). Needless to say your “negotiation power” will be near zero if you can’t speak the national language.In addition, being able to speak a fair amount of Japanese will definitively give more value to your candidature.Now about job itself.I believe it is a well known fact that Japanese salary-men work long hours. You should consider if you are willing to put the hard work and long hours. For instance, my typical work schedule start at 7:30 am until 8 or 9 pm. For the record I don’t think it is considered “hard work” here. Just so you know.I already talk about black company and the 3K here. Let me copy and paste the interesting part for this answer:On Japanese mainstream media you often hear that there is a ""lack of IT technicians."" According to NHK morning program ohayō Nippon, 87％ of IT companies say they need more IT technicians. It is specially true in startups (ventures) because Japanese people still prefer to secure a job in a big Japanese company (social pressure and reputation is high when it comes to once company’s name).In addition, the Japanese IT world suffers of so called ""3K"" reputation. In Japanese, 3K stands for きつい、帰れない、給料が安い (Kitsui, Kaerenai, Kyūryō ga yasui) or, in English, ""hard, unable to go back home, low salary"". There are unfortunately a lot of unscrupulous ""black"" corporation in the IT world.Therefore, there is a brain drain in the Japanese IT world. There is even a wikipedia page about it: IT業界離れ - WikipediaIs it really that bad?Yes and no.It will sound silly but it really depends on the company. If you look at companies such as DeNA, CyberAgent or Line, there is no chronic shortage of personnel there. On the contrary, despite being ventures (actually, mega-ventures) a lot of freshers apply there every year.During job hunting, I came across a lot of different company. Some where amazing, other where so black the guy in charge of the presentation almost burst into tears…How to tell apart black companies?Turnover in black businesses is abnormally high. If in the first three years, 30% of freshers leave the company, it is suspicious. The main reasons are:Overtimes are not paidTough working conditionsSalary is comparatively low (and doesn’t increase)Regarding salary, sometimes it is lower than expected but you should also check welfares. In my case, the salary is a little bit lower than average but I have apartment rental allowance, full subway allowance, self-investment allowance (they pay for diplomas and the books/courses I need to pass them), complete insurance and so forth.Fast employment process. Employment process for freshers is slow in Japan. There are several interviews and tests. If it seems abnormally short, that could be a red flag. However it is not necessarily the case. Some company, specially young one, doesn’t have time and resources to conduct eight interviews like in bigger companies.The interviewer's physical condition. Like I said, if the interviewer or employees seem really tired and/or sad, this doesn’t look good. It could be a bad cold or hay fever but generally you can tell apart. Use your guts.Office is dirty. During the company’s presentation or the interviews, look for signs of dirty office like dust. Ask to use the toilets. Toilets in Japan are almost always immaculate. If it smells bad, it doesn’t smell good for you either.Death from overwork and suicide. Big red flag. I know suicide rate is high in Japan (especially among men) and it could be not-work related but most case it is. Don’t waste your time and knowledge to help this kind of murderers.No follow-up after the job offer. I received a job offer by mail from a company that never ever contacted me afterward. I sent a hand-written refusal letter and still never heard a single word from them. It means you are just a number, they don’t care. In comparison, another company which gave me a job offer invited me and the other prospective employees for a official introduction and lunch with the employees. Even after I sent the refusal letter, they responded with a kind email and we are still on good terms as of today. My actual employee sent me a first email to avouch the job offer and a reminder email to know whether I made my decision to join in or not. You are a person, they do care about you and really want you to join in.Let’s talk more in details about how a typical Japanese IT company works.One common practice in IT world is to have 社内メンバー (member inside the company) and 客先常駐 (people working onsite at the client office). I don’t know if it is a common practice in other country but I’d say almost every IT company in Japan does it. Basically, you are like a subcontracted human resource. So you may be working for company A but really you’re developing a project for company B which could itself be a subcontractor of company C or D… Well you don’t really know for who you are developing.I think this practice is intensely frustrating. I personally like to know what my hours of sitting behind a desk will contribute to. I like to see results. But that is just my opinion.If that doesn’t bother you, you won’t have a problem to find a job in IT. Be prepared for a lot of stress though: generally, you will be sent to bigger companies than yours, with different rules and which can send a claim to your boss for whatever reason they feel is good enough (like yawning). Not that all company does that, but it happens.Another think I noticed is the overall lack of knowledge towards new technologies.I believe there are mainly two reasons for that:Lack of skills in English. Let’s be honest, new technologies information are mainly covered in English language. Which means if you don’t speak English you will never learn about it.Resistance to change. This one sounds like a stereotype towards Japanese people but it’s mostly true. The bigger the company, the stronger the resistance to change is. (If it works, why change?)Note: for the little stories, a lot of bank and investment systems in Japan are still running with cobol. Archaic version of IE are also very common here (and as a seasonal front-end dev that really piss me off!!!)However, those two points above could be your biggest weapons. For example, being able to speak English gives you access to ten times more first-hand information than Japanese. Need to solve a problem? No problem, surely someone somewhere in the world asked this in English. Being the web marketing guy, I’m on the edge for SEO tactics, which gives me an advantage over my company’s competitors.If you are a new technology maniac early-adopter kind of guy (or girl), you should aim small and fast developing startups. This is your best bet to find a “Silicon Valley” kind of environment.About the environment, you probably know Japan is quite homogeneous. Foreigners, except Chinese people, are still rare. Smaller companies are less strict on neckties and suits in general but a lot of big companies still ask every developer to wear one.Depending on your work and your responsibilities, you will be asked to know Japanese customs and strictly respects it. This point is actually common sense but I’ve heard or read countless foreigners complaining about how they can’t raise in their company, without first checking up their attitude.I kept the most interesting for the end: salary.To say it frankly, if you want an IT job in Japan, it’s not for the salary. The salary here is way way behind what you could expect in other parts of the world. Plus if the salary system of your company is based on age, you are pretty much fucked for at least 10 years. Their are exceptions to this point; I’m speaking in general.When looking for a job, double check what are the welfare and double check the salary system (based of results/objectives or something else, presence or absence of bonus etc.)Rereading my answer, it sounds like I’m very critical towards IT companies. In fact, I want to be honest with you. Japan is an amazing country, amazing people but the work culture can disturb a lot of people. I don’t want you to be under any illusions that all that is easy.However, I, for one, love living here, I really like my job, my company and my colleagues. I wouldn’t change it and I wouldn’t go back to France and its 35h/week.Sure, some things do bother me sometimes but hey, I took the decision to live and work aboard, I accept responsibility for my selection. Furthermore it’s my duty to adapt to the local customs. And so is yours."
what are some examples of sentences using the word hysteria	what is the best home wireless network setup and expected speeds	0	How can I study more effectively? I manage to make average grades from what I retain in class and with the little studying I manage to do. I do find flash cards work for definitions, but I am a nursing student and they can only go so far. Any tips?	While mesh networking is the “new-cool” — it doesn’t really answer the question, and it isn’t really new. For the home, network extenders, have existed for years and cost much less than mesh components, and do as good a job. As mesh components become more common, their prices may drop, only time will tell.Any home networking setup is defined by numerous pieces - your ISP’s speeds - uplink and downlink aka “the pipe”; the speed of your modem; the speed of your router; the number of devices who are sharing that pipe.Beyond that, the difference between a mesh network and an extended network, except in certain buildings of heavy stone/brick/steel construction is negligible.The ISP incoming pipe controls the maximum speed you can possibly get on any connected device. WiFi devices, being Radio Frequency (RF) based are subect to all kinds of speed impacting issues. The throughput speeds of your modem and router will determine how much of the incoming ISP pipe is actually available to any connected device. The good news here is that the newest Routers, especially, have significantly enhanced throughput - especially for WiFi.Since all Wi-Fi systems are RF based, positioning of the devices and the antennas will determine your coverage. This doesn’t matter if it is a mesh or an extended network. My previous home was a 4-story brick Victorian Row home some 3500 square feet. I used an Apple Airport base station in the basement and an Airport extender on the second floor to provide solid signal coverage for most all of the house. I say most all, because the physical shape of the first floor with regards to the basement ment that the Kitchen required a separate extender. Today, I live in an apartment building with heavy stone walls and steel framework — RF doesn’t penetrate the building for squat; no cellular coverage unless I’m standing in front of a glass window! So, naturally, Wi-Fi also does not penetrate from apartment to apartment. Yes, you could cover the area with a collection of extenders or mesh devices, but the same problems would exist with either solution.The final issue of speed is the most overlooked one — Your “backhaul” pipe only has so much bandwidth. It doesn’t matter how fast your local network or device is, if you have multiple people sharing that pipe — you have to divide the bandwith amongst them. If all you are doing is web-surfing or reading email, you won’t notice much — until somebody starts streaming video. Web-surfing and email are basically asynchronous actions which do not require constant packe transfers (ignoring YouTube, etc.) But as sooon as you start streaming video, including YouTube, you are talking about the need for constant bandwidth — usually quite high. So, depending upon how many streamers you have, your game playing WILL suffer significant degradation, as will the streams.
will there be another billion dollar lottery jackpot	when will the lottery reach the next billion dollar jackpot	1	Impossible to tell. It depends how many weeks it is until there is a lottery winner. When there is no grand prize winner in a lottery the prize rolls over and dollars are added.That grand prize keeps growing. However for it to reach a billion it means the lottery needs to go may weeks sans winner.On the other hand it is surprising the interest in that big number. Research shows there are people that will no play at 90 million but will stand on line for hours at 100 million? Isnt 90 million enough for them?	Impossible to tell.

how scary is it to drive on the road to hana given all of the turns	do i need a fourwheeldrive car to drive all the way on the road to hana	0	Scary as any other narrow two-lane, unmarked road. Wet conditions should be taken with caution. Also when coming around a bend, take a look at the other side of the valley to be aware of another car approaching from the other way. The bridges are narrow so sometimes it's best to wait on your side of the bridge and allow the other (maybe larger) vehicle to go first. Reversing on a narrow road or bridge is tricky.. I banged up my dad's car once doing this. So really, just be aware of everyone else on the road and take it slow... you'll get to Hana eventually :)	Thanks for the A2A.It's not necessary to have a four-wheel drive vehicle but there are some things to know before you take your journey:Have a full tank of gasBring some food even though you'll encounter roadside cartsObey the speed limit (25 mph); cops patrol the road heavilyWatch out for the tourists meandering on the roadBe wary of other traffic and narrow bridgesStop and enjoy the beauty every once in awhilePlan to stay overnight if it takes you awhile to get to the end.  It is highly suggested to not drive the road to Hana at nightThe only reason to have a four-while drive vehicle is there's a special part called Seven Sacred Pools that you can take when you leave that will take you through the mountain areas
does cognition affect perception	does cognitive strain affect digestion	0	There are, roughly, three layers of filters between the outside world and your perception of it. They are biological, psychological, and social. The latter two are indistinct from each other.The answer to your question is Yes. We cannot think about something until we have experienced it, we cannot think about a thing as a separate thing until we have defined it, and we cannot communicate about it until we have given it a word. Cognition affects everything we experience because cognition IS our experience.Try this TED talk.. Do we see reality as it is?	There could be another explanation: when studying hard you would move about a lot less, and moving around stimulates your bowels to move, you also might drink less, eat less food fiber, being busy just take a quick bite, and fluid and food fibers (at least 25–30 grams a day) besides being physically active stimulate your bowels so you have stools.

And that your only “clients” are a bunch of toxic kids. But hey, you don’t get to toss cleavers at people in a business.Here’s something most coaches realize you should do, which most players don’t.Learn and master easy championsInstead of spending time perfecting your mechanics at a champion, and again when that champion shifts out of the meta, and again, and again… Spare yourself the trouble. Pick the easiest champions. If you’re in the Elo range where Garen is still playable, play Garen. Dr. Mundo is another good example.Why easy champions?!Why would you do this? I didn’t know the reasoning for a long time, so as most people probably do when they hear this, I just ignored it. Then, I was reminded of it recently when I heard yet another strong player talk about this. It was the #1 Challenger in NA, Revenge, saying (verbatim): “Pick a champion and master it. And I mean, like, really master it. Because then, you can actually start focusing on the little things, like when to ward, where to ward, positioning in team fights, teleport timings, and so on.”The philosophy behind this principle can thus be summed up in the following procedure:Learn champion ==> Master champion ==> Learn game ==> Master gameIf you’re learning your champion, you’re just learning your champion. Only when you’ve mastered your champion, you can start learning the game. This is why you need to pick easy champions and stick with them. Even when you eventually get to high Elo, the only thing that changes is that “easy” is replaced with “meta”. This does inevitably mean you’ll have to spend more time on the game just to keep up; that’s just how most games work.Simple =/= EasyAlso, I should clear up a common misconception. If you’re a Toplaner, I have news for you: Tryndamere is not an easy champion. His mechanics are simplistic, but not easy. They require a very precise timing that revolves around registering your opponent’s damage outputs accurately and predicting if you will survive their hard-CC during which you can’t activate your ultimate.Pay attention!Of course, this whole point about picking a champion, based on a combination of strong and easy depending on your Elo, relies on you paying attention during the game. You can just as well play Garen and not look at the mini-map, not think “should I pick this fight?”, not think “Will there be a team fight?” and “Do I want that team fight to actually take place?”. In order to profit off of your newfound champion pool building skills, you have to learn to identify key situations of the game and consciously remind yourself to pay attention to them, for example by asking these questions. Only then will any method of champion pool building actually have the intended benefits. In other words: pay attention.Hopefully this was a bit helpful to any of you. These are some of the coaching principles I’ve picked up on from my very limited experiences with being a coach, and more so the playing principles I picked up from my experiences while playing.
is drinking 4 liters of water each day unhealthy	how many liters of water should i drink if i run  5000 ms daily	0	"Patients with kidney stones are often told to aim for 2 L of urine output a day. Considering you lose water while breathing, and in stool, and in sweat, 4 L is perfectly ok for many people (without a predisposition to retain water, kidney problems, or unusual diets). But that can't be routinely recommended without details. Think about getting rid of water. When you drink water, it dilutes your blood plasma, lowering the osmolality. This is sensed by the brain, which turns off a hormone called ADH or AVP. The absence of the hormone tells your kidney to release all the water it filters. But, to get water out, you have to get the water through the kidney filtration tube and out into the urine without being reabsorbed. So there has to be a sufficient filtration rate, and you have to have a healthy kidney which can reclaim salts while allowing the water to escape in urine. Healthy kidneys can remove almost all the salt in urine, but not all, and less healthy kidneys can't filter as much urine OR reclaim the salts in it. Thus, there is an obligate salt loss with urine output. If you keep losing salt in urine and don't consume enough (psychotic people can do this (psychogenic polydipsia) or alcoholics (beer potomania) or just frail elderly people with low salt diets (tea and toast syndrome)), your plasma sodium MUST drop, and the eventual result is that your brain cells will be exposed to a low salt environment. Water will move from the blood into the brain to equalize the difference. The brain swells, impairing function, and that can result in headaches, confusion, stupor, coma, and death. Some examples: excessive water challenges (Woman dies after being in water-drinking contest), or, sports. I have seen people with acute hyponatremia after drinking during a marathon (so they were losing salty sweat and replacing with mostly water presumably). Check out the last case mentioned at the end of the Wiki article: Water intoxication. That person had dangerous intoxication after daily consumption of 8 L, but he was probably a pretty healthy guy, and so an ill person could get sick at a lower dose.Conversely, some people cannot concentrate their urine or have high sweating losses or diarrhea etc. For them, drinking 4L daily might be required for survival! If their losses are mostly water, water would be a good replacement fluid; if they're losing sweat and diarrhea, they have to replace with salt containing solutions like WHO rehydration fluid: Oral rehydration therapy.In short, the answer is ""probably, but it depends,"" and the larger question is ""why would you do that?"" In general you can just drink to thirst. Avoid dehydration but don't kill yourself (literally) to drink lots more water than you need. "	HieeStaying hydrated is critical to your running performance and, more importantly, for preventing heat-related illnesses. Dehydration in athletes may lead to fatigue,headaches, decreased coordination, and muscle cramping. Other heat-related illnesses, such as heat exhaustion and heatstroke, have even more serious consequences. Runners need to pay attention to what and how much they’re drinking before, during and after exercise.Pre-Run HydrationIf you're doing a long run or race (more than 8 to 10 miles), it's important to make sure you're well-hydrated during the few days leading up to your long run. You know you're well-hydrated if you void large volumes of pale urine at least six times a day. In the days leading up to your long run (or race), drink plenty of water and nonalcoholic fluids.An hour before you start your run, try to drink about 16 ounces of water or other non-caffeinated fluid.Drinking on the RunThe current advice about running and hydration is very simple -- try to drink to thirst. Scientific evidence says that drinking when you're thirsty can help prevent under hydrating (which can lead to dehydration) and over hydrating, which can lead to hyponatremia (low blood salt level due to abnormal fluid retention).If you're looking for a general rule of thumb for fluid consumption during your runs: You should take in 4 to 6 ounces of fluid every 20 minutes during your runs. Runners running faster than 8-minute miles should drink 6 to 8 ounces every 20 minutes.Determining Your Sweat RateThe above guidelines are the basic rules of thumb, but it's important to remember that everyone's fluid needs vary. Some people sweat more than others. To determine how much liquid to take during a run or race, you need to know your sweat rate, and that can vary between 1 to 4 quarts per hour. Weigh yourself nude before a timed training run, and then again after. One pound of weight loss equals 1 pint of water loss. Calculate your sweat rate and use this to determine your fluid needs during a run or race. For example, if you lose 2 pounds during an hour run, that's 2 pints or 32 ounces. Thus, you need 8 ounces of water or sports beverage every 15 minutes. Note the weather conditions on that day, and keep in mind that you may need to adjust your consumption if the conditions are different. You can do the sweat rate test on another day to see how different conditions affect your sweat rate.Post-Run HydrationDon't forget to rehydrate with water or a sports drink after your run. You should drink 20 to 24 fl oz. of water for every pound lost. If your urine is dark yellow after your run, you need to keep rehydrating. It should be a light lemonade colour.Thanks & Regards:Deepak Parul Sandhu

do porn stars watch porn	how can i book ronda rousey to star in an adult movie	0	Sure. Some adult entertainers will watch their own scenes while others will only watch other scenes excluding them. But of all the adult entertainers I’ve met, big and small, literally every single last one has openly stated that they do watch porn. If I ever meet an entertainer who says otherwise, I’ll come back and edit this question, but as of right now, of the many entertainers I’ve met including men, women, and even a few transgendered, all have stated that to this day they will watch porn.To be clear, I’m not saying that every single last adult entertainer watches porn, but rather that at least a vast majority do.	You reach out to her manager and extend an offer. But know ahead in advanced that you’re far from the first to extend an offer to her, and odds are, just like every person and company before you, her answer will remain a firm “no”.Keep in mind, win or lose, she’s the most glorified female UFC fighter, and she’s got the bank account to prove it.Her latest public offer was $5-million to be the leading role in Captain Marvel XXX: An Axel Braun Parody, which if you haven’t guessed as of yet, she declined. I believe she was offered roughly the same amount to do a single scene and she declined that as well.
trump supporters how do you feel about the way he  walking back his promises	do trump supporters now expect the president to live up to his promises he so forcefully sold them on	0	Trump is winning on all fronts. The “Stormy” story was the last straw that Liberals were clutching at. But it isn’t paying off like they were hoping. Dems will even lose the midterms. What are Liberals going to do?	I never saw the Trump presidential campaign and its success as being predicated on any actual policy or any actual ability to govern. Trump never really told us how he’d do any of the things he said he’d do, and certainly has given nobody any reason to believe he’d be minimally competent to BE a decent President. If it truly were about governing, Trump’s feet would have been put to the fire until he actually TOLD us how he was going to do it. But his supporters didn’t ever ask that question, because they really didn’t care about that. They threw his support to him because he was talking just like their buddies at the bar do after a few rounds and they liked that talk.The only things we really know are the following:He’d build a wall on the US-Mexico border. (How?)He’d scrap the ACA. (he’s changing his mind about this one though).He’d deport undocumented immigrants. (How? Especially since police departments are now going on record as stating they will not help him do this)He’d bring back jobs to the Rust belt and coal country. (Umm..How? Especially since the Donald’s businesses are known for overseas manufacturing)He wouldn’t hesitate to bring back some of the worst Bush era ideas regarding fighting terrorism, even going as far as bombing innocent people who are unlucky enough to live in the same area as ISIS strongholds. (We’ll see about this-but we do know this is possible since Bush and his crew did do a lot of this stuff).He will ban Muslims from entering the country (How?)Frankly, I don’t think Trump supporters care if he does these things or not. It was never about governing. It was about aggrieved working class and poor people, the vast majority of them being white and living in former factory/coal strongholds that have long withered away deciding that they’d had it with people who weren’t like them race wise, education wise, and life experience wise crapping all over them and what they believe in. Trump was a big middle finger to them.So, they don’t CARE what he does or doesn’t do. Trump is already backpedaling on a lot of what he said during the election, and people are still excusing him-just like they excused all of the hateful rhetoric, just like they excused the support from white nationalists and other racist groups, just like they excused all of the stumbling by Trump during the campaign, just like they excused all of the stuff involving Trump’s treatment of women, just like they excused Trump’s long list of business practices that actually PUT working people and small companies out of business and were outright fraudulent.They don’t care about whether or not he is fit to be President, or whether or not he appoints nutballs and slimebags to his administration, or whether or not he puts his kids in charge of national security, or whether or not his decisions that he will make as President will benefit him personally or not. None of that matters to this folk.What matters is that they were able to put a hurting on people they dislike, have no respect for, or outright hate. This didn’t start with Trump, the Tea Party was the earliest indication of this. They LOVE the fact that NOW, the news media is talking about THEM, and that the “librul” media and that the elites (meaning anyone with a college degree who doesn’t live in the Rust Belt or the South) are flogging themselves for not listening to them all of these years. THEY are loving the attention and understanding/respect they are getting from the media and how in the future, respect will be paid. They also LOVE the fact that women, gay people, minorities and everyone else they have been saying have been given unjust breaks, respect, and attention at their expense are running scared and are distraught/angry. Just like a kid after throwing a tantrum, they got the attention they wanted-by putting in power a man who has absolutely nothing in his record to even give anyone any confidence about his ability or willingness to govern this country competently and to represent this country to the world.Unfortunately for them, this tantrum will get them nothing. The jobs aren’t coming back. The forces that put these people in the shape they are in will not be stopped by shipping a few Mexicans back to Mexico. Some of those forces are their responsibility, and some of these forces are not. And Trump will do nothing to end or stop those forces. He really can’t, even if he had half a clue how to do it. We don’t even know if he really WANTS to, seeing as he makes money off of shipping some of his business labor requirements to those same countries he’s now complaining about. Remember, this is the same guy that was happy about the 2008 recession-he boasted of making a ton of money off of the devastation that was the real estate market at the time.That’s what this was about. Don’t kid yourself. Trump in all likelihood will do none of the stuff he said he’d do (unless it benefits him personally), because he understands that his fans don’t expect him to (it might be the only thing he really understands about being a politician). He said as much when he said he could shoot someone in the middle of Fifth Avenue and his fans would still stand by him, and he wasn’t wrong-any one of the numerous things that he has said and is on record of having done, including all the lawsuits against him would have sunk any other candidate a long time ago.
why are we worried about others opinions	why do we care for others opinion and about what others think about us	1	People want to feel good about themselves. The only way for us to know if we are a good person is by hearing the opinions of others. I mean, how else do we know, right….?What happens when all that good stuff comes crashing down when something bad is said about us? It’s because what other people’s thoughts are, are what build us up as a person. When someone breaks that system with something we haven’t heard of before, we either get defensive or feel insecure.This insecurity makes us wonder if the good things the other people have stacked up for us is….actually true. What if there are others who had built us up who were actually lying. What if this new mean “thing” is stronger than what I’m built up on?All these new scary concepts burst out from our brain and we suppress our self-happiness.After a while, we move on and keep building up our happiness. Several more bad things pop up. The more you build up this castle of happiness the more random bricks of badness pop up from somewhere.Now you start categorizing these bad bricks. These bad bricks in their different sections represent what insecurities you have and when you feel them If you are building a wall with your castle with pristine white bricks and all of a sudden, a grey brick plops from the sky and starts melting the good bricks, you already know…You: “Oh! Another bad brick, John! This one looks like a uh….physical breaker. Category: lopsided eyes. Throw it to the physical break pile! Is there a lopsided eye sector yet?”Worker John: “uuuhm… there are 12 of that one, sir. Give it.”You: *toss*As your castle gets bigger, the bad bricks start to fume and cause this pollution. It stenches the air around you. You can smell it even through the safe thick bricks of your beautiful white castle. You can either ignore this luring stench or take them out.The bad bricks start to build up their own castle. On their own. The smell is absolutely awful.It’s slowly killing your workers. With shovel and drills, you quickly run out of your white castle and dismantle the grey castle before it consumes you.You dump them into the sea, basket by basket full of bricks, where they are put out of their fiery stench.Or you can let the bricks suffocate you in your White Castle.	Dear friend,We give consideration to society(others) because whatever we are doing, is usually for the sake of society.Whatever you call as your ‘personal’ actions, the horrible fact is that even they are social actions. We may think that when we are alone in our house, let’s say in the kitchen or in the study room, then whatever we are doing over there, is a personal action. But it is not a personal action at all, because it is still being dictated by the society.There is a student who is in her study room preparing for an engineering entrance examination. But she is preparing just because of the social pressure. Now is this preparation, is the moment of preparation when she is alone in her study, is this a personal action or a social action?It is still a social action, even though the society does not appear to be present. The society is physically not present, but it is very much present. Where? In the mind. So even when we are doing something very personal, we are still guided by the society.Marriage, you would say is something totally personal. Marriage and love, are both called as ‘personal’. But are we not guided by the society in all these matters? So, are our marriages personal? Is our love personal? No, it is totally social. Society, religion, class, all these things are guiding even our most private and intimate matters. And when our matters are all social, it is but obvious that we have to care for the society.You look at all these matrimonial portals. People who want to marry put their profile there. When you put your profile and fill the profile form, it has sections for your religion, for your caste, for your gotra. It asks, “How much salary do you expect from your would-be spouse? What height, what kind of complexion? Whether he should be living in a joint family or a nuclear family?”Now, are all these things not social? Did you decide your religion? Religion is a totally social thing which is handed over to you, and now you allow religion to come in the way of your love. Is love then social or personal?You are saying, “I will marry a boy of my gotra.” Now you didn’t decide your gotra. Did you? So, are you marrying the boy or the gotra marrying the boy? Obviously, one gotra is marrying the other gotra, where is any personal thing in this? It’s all social, you are not present in this. It’s a crowd. It’s all social, you are not present in this. It’s a crowd.Society has taught us what kind of features to look for in people to love. Now, because of years of colonization, in fact decades of colonization, in India you lay a great emphasis on fair skin. There are all these companies that sell fairness products in India. And believe me they cannot easily do that in any other country of the world. No country of the world is so mentally enslaved about complexion that you can sell a fairness cream, and people would also buy it.Elsewhere, people will say, “It is fine that I am dark. Being dark is alright.” But you go on a date and you meet a boy who has very fair skin, you would choose him. But it is not you who has chosen him, it is the society that has chosen him for you. So, it’s not actually you who are dating him, the entire crowd is dating that boy. It may appear that two persons are meeting, but the two persons are not meeting, two crowds are meeting. Where are you in all this?What we call as ‘ourselves’ is nothing but a crowd- mummy, papa, relatives and the entire world. Even when you say that I am doing something personal, the entire crowd is present. We are afraid of the society because we are not at all ourselves. We are just the society. What we need to ask is that is there anything that I am doing which is coming from my own free will? Is there anything that is arising out of understanding?Actions, thoughts, beliefs, that I consider as ‘normal’, are they really normal or are they just conditioned? You general...
how do you potty train a 4 months pitbull	how do i potty train my twomonthold labrador pup	1	Well this is a simple process as long as you put in your time to chalk out a routine that matches your pup’s daily routine. Having a pup at home is like having a baby in the house except that they grow up quickly :PGenerally these young naughty creatures have a very simple routine – Eat, Sleep and Play. And this cycle goes in loop throughout their life. The only changes that come in this cycle are the intervals between these three main activities increases and their duration decreases with their growing age. This was in short the entire life of dogs.Now a little homework you need to do before you start the training :-1.    Understand your pups entire routine. This will include all his day along activities along with time like when does he eat, when does he sleep, when does he go for a walk, how often does he eat and how much.2.    You need to understand when can you take him out and at what times and how far would be the places you can take him to pass off.3.    The words that you would use to prompt him to go out. These are very important as they are a lifelong learning for the pup and that’s how he can signal you that he wants to go out.That’s it. Just a little work. Pups generally want to pass after:-1.    Waking up in the morning(especially)2.    Sometime after having meals3.    Playing or rigorous activityThey don’t have much control over themselves so a good thing would be to take time out at least every hour or two. This absolutely does not mean that you wake him up from the sleep and take him out just because I said so. I am saying this because if your pup is very playful then it will need to pass after every hour or so. Morning schedule has to be followed strictly and not missed out at any cost else you’ll see wet patches on your favourite carpet. Eating meals stimulates their digestive system which is why when they are done, after 15-20mins take them out for a small walk. This will help them digest the food well as well as pass off.  You need to decide a place where you take him. In case you have a garden and want a specific spot to be introduced to him as his area to pass then take him there. This introduction has to be done in early years. Also always accompany him. Reasons – they feel secured and the bond between you and him enhances, to protect him from any unforeseen situation, to keep a check that it does not eat something outside(as this is the time when they are very exploring and when I say “EXPLORING” I mean every alphabet of it.), to keep him from scaring an older dog( which they love doing) and to watch his health as well. Initially, pat him whenever he understands your “secret” word and goes out to pass. You can also treat him for this. You can decide the time to take him out according to how far is the place from your house and fix the timings to take him out matching your and his schedule. As far as the words are concerned decide them carefully. Don’t mix them with any other command words. Some things to avoid disturbances in this routine: - 1. Don’t overfeed or frequently change their diet or the type of foods they generally have.2. Feeding at wrong times or not on fixed timings3. Excess of salt and spices(this makes them drink more water)4. Leaving the door open for the pup to come and go as it wants5. Restrict their access to carpets and rugs( just in case you want as they feel like grass).6. Don’t expect him to spend the entire night without going out especially when it’s so young.7. Punishing, scolding and shouting on him for any indoor accidents(this will make him scared of you and he might not pass in front of you)8. Leaving the pup alone for long hours. This will make him such an indoor person that it will not go out for long and will rush indoors quickly.Don’t be lazy. Laziness on your part would disrupt the habits of your pup. Some common problems faced by owners: --> Excited urination on greeting people or overdose of happiness – Sometimes pups get over excited when they greet people or get their favourite treat. To avoid this take him outside before anybody arrives at your house or before you are planning to give him his favourite treat.->Does not pass off when outside – Pups don’t relieve when out for  long walks and pass immediately getting indoors. You need to break this habit take him for a long walk so he is forced to go outside. Many a times things won’t go as planned. It’s okay. Understand you both are learning. He is learning something he doesn’t know and he can’t tell you what he feels. You need to give him time. And you are learning what he loves doing, eating and how much he loves you.Above all love him as much as you can. That’s the only emotion they have in abundance and they do it selflessly. Enjoy !! :D	Well this is a simple process as long as you put in your time to chalk out a routine that matches your pup’s daily routine.

if i jump rope for five minutes how many calories will i use	what  the best way to jump rope	0	Given that you do not go near your maximum speed for the whole 5 minutes - you will burn approximately 50 calories and will continue burning them for a short while. The main idea is to keep your heart pumping as long as you can. In general, from just jumping rope 5 minute a day you are looking at about 50-80 burned calories, depending on your metabolism.	What is the seminal study that uses functional MRI to demonstrate that rhythmic upper arm movement (such as jumping rope) is the best way to 'cement' long term memory retention?

Then if the person is interested in more he or she should find the book that fits his level and need ideally focusing on a field of interest.Now if the person is interested in maths then it's not so different, only the set of problems to solve would be maths oriented.
what is the temperament of a bullmastiffhusky mix	what is the temperament of a corgihusky mix	0	"Every dog is different, so anything anyone says is going to be a generalization, so just keep that in mind. They will be very smart, I've met German Shepherds and Huskies that were smarter than a lot of people I know (and I know a lot of smart people), so expect to be outwitted. I just texted a friend of mine who has a GSD-Husky mix and asked him what one thing he'd tell someone thinking about getting one, and he texted me back, saying, ""The dog will be smarter than you. Best to just accept that now."" Truer words...You must start training early. If you don't there's a tendency toward stubbornness, especially if you don't constantly reinforce training. They're very suited to a very active lifestyle, and would be best having a big yard.Also, expect fierce loyalty. That can be a problem, so make sure to socialize your pup early and often. You don't want your dog biting your date/spouse when you get frisky. It kinda dampens the mood. I'd also socialize with other pups and cats if possible at a very young age.Huskies and German Shepherds are consistently in the top 5 breeds that are likely to bite humans, so you must train, train, train and never allow them off leash when in public. If you let your dog off leash, the dog is going to pay the price if something goes wrong, so if you love them, leash them.Did I mention training?"	I’ve looked up some common opinions from Corgi Husky mix owners.Here is what they have to say about this adorable mixed breed:“This little guy melts my heart every time I look at him. Not only is he adorable, but he’s very energetic and a trainable dog.”“You can think of the horgi a bit like a compact husky. They’re a bit devious, but they love to do tricks and learn new things. Very fun to have around at home. I would definitely recommend them!”“What’s not to love about this ball of energy? You have to exercise them, or they’ll make a mess at home. Keep that in mind.”Some people have nicknamed this breed to be called the Horgi or the Siborgi! You can see both of these words commonly used to refer to the Corgi Husky mix.SizeGenerally speaking, the Corgi Husky mix is a small to medium sized dog that has a tendency to sit low to the ground more like the Corgi than like a Husky. While the dog did take some physical characteristics of the Husky, they largely remained the size of a Corgi.Most Horgis weigh between 20 and 50 pounds and stand about 13 to 15 inches off the ground.The Horgi is a small to medium sized dog and is low set to the ground like the Corgi. It is thought the idea of this breeding might have been to get the Husky look but with the Corgis smaller and lower set stature. He weighs between 20 to 50 pounds and stands around 13 to 15 inches tall. This means he is quite a sturdy looking dog but with short legs. He head is rounded, and he has eyes that are almost almond shaped and ears that can be erect.AppearanceThe Horgi looks like a Husky with a smaller, shorter stature like the Corgi. They look very sturdy, but have very short little legs that are usually associated with Corgis.Colorwise, the coat of the Corgi Husky mix can look like the Corgi or the Husky.

there are 8 balls 7 of them weigh the same 1 of them has a different weight you do not  know if it  heavier or lighter how do you find the odd ball with 2 weighs	how many 4 digit numbers can be formed by using 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 and 7 how many of them are between 4000 and 6000	0	There are 8 balls. Four of them weigh X grams each, and the other four weigh Y grams each. Your task is to find two balls having different weights. You have a balance scale with two pans on which you can compare the weight of any number of balls. What is the minimum number of weighings?	3584 and 1023Total number of four digit numbers can be formed from the given digits = 7*8*8*8 = 3584Between 4000 and 6000 means that these two numbers will not be included.The first position can be filled in 2 ways {4, 5}The next three positions can be filled in 8 ways each {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7}Total ways = 2*8*8*8 = 1024But we need to exclude 4000 that is already included in the answer.=> Required numbers = 1024 - 1 = 1023

if dark energy is created with expansion can infinite of it be created	if energy is not conserved in an expanding universe is potential energy infinite the energy that can be created is infinite	1	The popular hypothesis on the expanding universe is partially summed up by the Big Rip (Big Rip) conjecture.We know that the universe is expanding. What is new is that there seems to be an acceleration to this expansion. If so, it will lead to some astounding dynamic events in the universe. As described in the Wiki article and in many other sites on the internet, at some point in the far future the expansion rate will become greater than the gravitational attraction of the galaxies, which will begin to move away from each other. Then galaxies themselves will diffuse and spread apart, then solar systems (which will be long dead by then), followed by stellar remnant disintegration, planetary disintegration, molecular disintegration.What happens next is still open to conjecture, but we can do a thought experiment and come up with a pretty good answer.The accelerating expansion will then pull electrons from nuclei and pull protons and neutrons from the nucleus.Now things become interesting. All the neutrons will decay to protons, electrons, and anti-neutrino within a brief time, leaving protons as the next target.But what happens when the expansion rate becomes greater than the strong nuclear force? Well, we know that the proton is made up of three quarks (two up and one down). We also know that quarks cannot exist in isolation. So what happens? The increasing expansion of the universe becomes greater than the strong nuclear force and pulls the quarks apart. This takes a great deal of energy. Where does this energy come from?As the quarks are pulled apart, they combine with virtual quark particles from the vacuum energy and form mesons; quark and anti-quark pairs. Normally, the mesons would decay very quickly (10−8𝑡𝑜10−1610−8to10−1610^{-8}to 10^{-16}) seconds, but the rate of expansion pulls the quark anti-quark pair of the meson apart before it can decay. This produces two more mesons, which produce four mesons, which produce eight, and we have an exponentially increasing creation of matter.Where does the energy come from to create all this matter? One proposed form of dark energy is that it is equivalent to the vacuum energy of space, that is, virtual particles. And dark energy is proposed as the energy of acceleration.So now we see that dark energy is being converted to matter in the form of quark anti-quark mesons and thus the amount of dark energy is reduced. If dark energy is reduced, so then is the acceleration of the universe. Eventually, we have complete conversion of dark energy to meson matter. But the expansion continues and meson matter continues to form.We can think of the initial expansion rate of the universe as inertia. The continued formation of meson matter then begins to slow down the expansion rate. But since we have an exponential growth of meson matter, the expansion rate will slow down rapidly.When the expansion rate slows enough, the mesons will then have time to decay into photons (gamma), electrons, positrons, neutrinos, and anti-neutrinos. The electrons and positrons will combine and decay into two gamma photons. So the resulting universe will consist of photons, neutrinos, and anti-neutrinos.What happens next is completely unknown and would require some clever and difficult calculations to arrive at an answer. Will the resulting expansion rate become negative? Will the significantly increased mass-energy of the universe contribute to a negative expansion (shrinking)?Lots of good things to think about here.Cheers!

who is disrupting bloomberg	who will disrupt bloomberg	1	Intrinio, where I am a writer, is working on this by building a financial data marketplace that addresses many of Bloomberg’s weaknesses.Bloomberg charges massive fees ($2,000 per person per month) for a terminal that includes just about everything any investor would want. This is great if you have $2,000/mo for each of your employees and need many types of data. Intrinio takes a different approach, allowing users to sign up for just the data feeds the need. This means that if you only need 1 or 2 feeds, your costs might be $40 or $140 per month, or even be free.Another problem with Bloomberg is that they restrict access to their data. This is changing somewhat, with online portals, but most Bloomberg users have to access the data they need through a specific “terminal.” Intrinio thinks this is ridiculous and so allows any number of users to access a single paid account via Excel, Google Sheets, or even API.This last access method, API, is probably the key difference. Fintech developers typically can’t build financial applications because company’s like Bloomberg have a monopoly on the data and charge outrageous prices if you want to redistribute their data via an app. Intrinio makes its data easy to access for developers and even has a program to give data away for free to startups.This article gives a good overview of Intrinio’s API.If you want to know who will disrupt Bloomberg, check out Intrinio. We are shaking up the status quo, making it affordable and easy to access financial data.

why can flash run so fast	the flash dc character how fast can the flash run a mile	0	"The Flash (Barry Allen) originally wasn't very fast, actually.  He could run about the speed of sound, or Mach 1, in the comics and in the TV show.  This is because when he was struck by lightning and doused with chemicals, which sped up his metabolism to superhuman speeds, but not impossible speeds.  In the comics, Barry Allen then discovers a strange energy called the Speed Force.  This energy was found to actually exist outside the universe, surrounding it.  Barry Allen could then travel much faster, and, with practice, could travel up to light speed.  By siphoning kinetic energy from other objects in the universe, he could travel up to ""trans-time- speed,"" basically making him faster than any measure of time that exists.  The Speed Force allows him to do this because it supplies him with the energy needed to achieve these feats, and break the laws of physics."	How fast does he need to?At the speed of light, he can run a mile in 5.3 microseconds. Yes, in five millionths of a single second.One microsecond is to one second as one second is to 11.574 days.He could travel 65,000 miles in the time it takes you to blink, literally able to circle the globe 2.4 times. A human eye can blink as quickly as 1/3 of a second.At the speed of light, he could circle the globe seven times in a single second.Despite the Flash's ability to move at near near or at the speed of light without deleterious effects on the environment (thanks to the Speed Force), he doesn't move around that fast all the time. There simply isn't any need to.A leisurely Mach two (or about .3 miles per second) is more than fast enough for the average metropolis.If you are talking about The Flash (TV Series 2014– )This speedster is still taking baby steps in his new Flash costume. He has been clocked in-in universe at his current maximum of about Mach 1.1. He has quite a way to go before he is approaching light speed.A scientist who works with WIRED Magazine says the television show video animations indicates he moves at about 700 miles per hour at his current operating speed; kudos to the animation team.His in-universe feats include:Episode 1 - City of Heroes: Hits around 700 mph in order to counter the Weather Wizard’s tornado.Episode 5 - Plastique: Fast enough to run up a building and run on water for the first time. (No idea how fast that has to be, but I am sure someone around here will tell me...)Episode 6 - The Flash is Born: Successfully achieves Mach 1.1 (837 mph) in order to disrupt Girder's molecular integrity.Episode 23 - Fast Enough: The Flash is clocked at Mach 2 inside STAR Labs when they are trying to send the Reverse Flash back to the future.If this Flash had to run a mile at his new maximum speed he could do it in .3999 seconds.If you really want to dig into the Flash's powers:How would you explain the Flash's superpowers?How is The Flash able to take such sharp turns at mach speeds? Wouldn't he be affected by inertia?Who would win in a fight between Superman and the Flash?(includes a primer on The modern New 52 Flash - Quora)Read more information about the Speed Force.

what is the best way to invest  dollar 500 legally so that i can get tangible profits over a relatively short period of time say 6 months	how can i best invest  nonascii 5000 over the next 6 months	0	"My suggestion would be the foreign exchange market (Forex). This is too little to invest in stocks (many brokers charge 10-15 bucks to make a trade whether in or out of a stock, this will eat profits. In Forex ( monetary trading, ie. the USD vs. Japanese dollar) the money is put in online and companies facilitating the trade make money off of the spread. This makes it much more possible to make money with frequent trades. First you will need to get aquainted with how these work (try out a forex simulator) however the possibilities are great, and I have seen people increase their investment by 12% in a week. You must be dedicated, however, this is no market to leave your money in and forget about it.If this is out of the question I would suggest loaning money to friends in need... ""Hey can you spot me $80 tonight?"" ""Sure, but you owe me $90 tomorrow""This works quite often, and can boost your return by a large amount over a few days if you get a bite.  The issue here is it works best among the young and their friends, and only in low quantities (if you tell somebody you'll lend them 4k today for 5k next week they are gonna tell you off)"	It basically depends on what ROI you want over a period of time.If you're not risk averse then you should probably consider going for an SIP as other mode of investment like stocks or FDs won't work out for u as the brokerage would eat up the profits or the duration would be min one year respectively.What you can do is either take a library membership or buy really good books and invest in yourself, as that would be the best you'd do to yourself.
how will the implementation of gst bill impact the lives of common people	what exactly is gst bill and how exactly will it affect the common people	1	The primary impacts will be in the form of:More employment[1]Better government services[2]Lower corruptionThis is why it attracts so much excitement. There are some side effects of lower prices over the long term, but compared to the benefits above, it is a relatively minor effect.The primary way to get India out of poverty is to have a manufacturing revolution. However, most entrepreneurs don’t want to setup factories in India. Part of the reason is due to extreme complexity in taxation. Clothing manufacturers would rather setup their factories in places like Bangladesh [already has GST and other reforms] rather than the traditional textile power of India.What the GST seeks to do is to remove one of the primary hurdles in setting up business in India. When factories can move things efficiently and effectively comply with laws, more factories will be created. When more factories are created, there will be more jobs, lower prices [more competition] and more tax collection for the government.The GST is expected to bring government more revenues and this has been the case in many other countries that have implemented: Goods and services tax (Australia).When governments make more money through GST either they can reduce other taxes or increase services. Either of these will be benefit for the common man.Finally, the GST will enable much more transparency and lower corruption as there is a single window of tax collection than an opaque system with babus inserting hands in every window.Biggest concerns:The tax rate is very high[3]especially for services.

how can you recover your gmail password	i do not remember my password to my gmail account how can i recover my account	1	"If the user has lost or forgotten his Gmail password, he can restore the account in three ways. Either you must have a different e-mail ID or a trustworthy phone number or answer some security questions. In the event that the user does not have an approved telephone number, the Gmail account repetition can be performed without a telephone number by other means.Open the login page.Click the ""Can not access account"" link.In the next window, select ""I forgot my password ..."".Click ""Next"" and enter the correct and complete Gmail ID and the code that appears in the window, and click ""Next"" again.The next page will ask you to choose the option. Select ""Alternate Email ID"" and click ""Next"".The message is displayed indicating that the notification has been sent.If the user has no other e-mail ID or phone number, you must click ""I have none of these"".The error search is then redirected to a form in which the user has to provide little accurate information about his account. This information can be like the last name, surname, date of birth, security question answer, last access password, city, city, etc. Basically, the Gmail team will try to identify the user through all the details mionute.When the user is checked, a notification is sent to reset the password.The user can review the notification and follow the instructions to reset the password and retrieve the account again."	How do I reset my Gmail password when I don't remember my recovery information?Sad fact: You CAN’T.Unsurprisingly, Google has very solid account security. Among the finest in the world, in fact. If you have lost or forgotten your Google/Gmail password, or if your account was hacked, you have exactly one way to get back into that account. The automated process that starts here:https://accounts.google.com/sign...That’s IT.Really!I’ve answered variations on this other times and places, and added a lot of other detail. But it all adds up to the same thing.If you have a G Suite account thru a business or school, you can call your Administrator. If you own a G Suite hosted domain (cheaper and easier than you think, and worth doing) or if you are an Admin on a domain, then you can call tech support at Google, directly. They’re available 24/7, and trust me, they are good.But with a free Gmail account, if you get locked out, you absolutely cannot contact a human being at Google about it. You can’t call, text, email, snail mail, carrier pigeon or pony express them.Sorry. No.UPDATE, 10/17/2018. There is a new product, Google One. It offers additional account storage - and tech support, for gmail addresses, including live phone support. Which of course made me VERY curious if this could be used to unlock accounts. So being as I already pay for additional storage and was therefore automatically enrolled in Google One, I filled in the little form, and had them call me.And the answer is… NO. The tech support folks you can reach with the Google One service do indeed work for Google. But they do not (and cannot!) offer any assistance for locked out accounts, other than to walk you thru the automated process. If that process fails to get you in - you lost the account.Side issue: The reason there are so many collapsed answers here is because there are a ton of scammers out there who want you to call them, and they work hard to get their links into Quora answers. They will also use every trick there is to convince you they are somehow affiliated with or sanctioned by Google. They aren’t. They can only use the same automated process I linked above - and charge you good money for doing something you can do yourself.Again, there is only one way to recover a free Gmail/Google account.https://accounts.google.com/sign...If you can’t get in using that process, you lost the account. Forever.So the best advice I can give you is to carefully go thru the Security Checkup process on your Google Account page, here: https://myaccount.google.comYou can set up a recovery phone number and email address. I STRONGLY suggest you use both, and make the recovery email address one that belongs to a close family member or trustworthy friend. NOT one of your own, that you may forget or lose!Also set up 2-Step Verification, using every possible safety option, including printing your recovery codes and stashing them in several places. Used properly, 2 Step can and will prevent your account getting hacked.
how accurately can a mental illness can be diagnosed	how can i accurately diagnose and medicate my mental illness	1	Contrary to popular belief in this thread, it is entirely possible to accurately self-diagnose a “mental illness”. The fact that it is risky, potentially unnecessary, and professionally unverified is where the ethical conundrum comes in. It may not be in your best interest, and you may not have the information that would lead you to a proper understanding of whether it is in your best interest.Secondly, it is also possible to figure out an appropriate medication regimen on your own, in the rarer cases that a medication regimen is the most useful strategy. But, once again, that is highly risky, potentially unnecessary, and lacking the professional oversight and resources that are ideal towards keeping drugging more productive and less dangerous.The first is not the worst idea, if it is a constructive step for you and you do not rely on that diagnosis to determine your life path or risk-taking therapeutic goals. The second is not a good idea at all. Even if you are one of the minority that could benefit significantly from drugging, the trickiness and substantial risks involved with psychiatric psychotropics means one could not conscionably suggest that you would be better off taking that sort of risk as compounded by a lack of professional input and oversight.Ultimately, the DSM and prescribing information packets are not the governing forces behind psychiatric decisions. They are guidelines and fuzzy boundaries and they neither guarantee accurate and helpful outcomes nor safety and appropriateness. The level of additional understanding and experience-driven expertise involved in tactical and risk-reducing prescribing of psychotropic drugs in the mental health setting is not reducible to a few chapters of a book, though handling the needs of a single patient is at least less of a potential shitfest than fancying yourself a doctor and taking on clients.Basically, can this turn out well? Sure. That does not mean it is more likely to, and it has not even been established on authority that medication is a good idea in the first place.Do understand that ‘finding the right dose’ is not the most difficult part of prescribing psychiatric drugs. Finding the drugs that cause the least amount of trouble for someone while still being meaningfully useful, and dealing with emergent side effects (which can be life-threatening, long term, or disabling)—including withdrawal syndromes—is a more pressing matter. So, it is not just about “right drug, right dose”, but how to taper up and down, what drug combinations to avoid, how to notice negative side effects and what aspects of the drugging to ascribe them to, etc.A professional will not necessarily do a great job at all, and thousands upon thousands of patients experience preventable harms and death because of how the mental healthcare system is run at the moment. However, this is not something you want to do without professional consultation—especially good professional consultation. If you are desperate and determine to do something about your experiences, focusing on the non-pharmaceutical methods until you can access a psychiatrist or other kind of competently prescribing doctor is probably the best idea.Some psychiatrists, to note, are available by telephone or videoconference. It is not the most reliable or responsible way to evaluate patients or prescribe drugs, but even that would be better than ‘flying blind’ in the professional sense. There are also free, low-cost, or sliding-scale psychiatric practices in many areas, though this may not be an option for you still.And, to be clear, I am not a healthcare professional, either. This is just lay commentary from someone who has dealt with many providers, facilities, conditions, drugs, and patients.

They are guidelines and fuzzy boundaries and they neither guarantee accurate and helpful outcomes nor safety and appropriateness. The level of additional understanding and experience-driven expertise involved in tactical and risk-reducing prescribing of psychotropic drugs in the mental health setting is not reducible to a few chapters of a book, though handling the needs of a single patient is at least less of a potential shitfest than fancying yourself a doctor and taking on clients.Basically, can this turn out well? Sure. That does not mean it is more likely to, and it has not even been established on authority that medication is a good idea in the first place.Do understand that ‘finding the right dose’ is not the most difficult part of prescribing psychiatric drugs. Finding the drugs that cause the least amount of trouble for someone while still being meaningfully useful, and dealing with emergent side effects (which can be life-threatening, long term, or disabling)—including withdrawal syndromes—is a more pressing matter. So, it is not just about “right drug, right dose”, but how to taper up and down, what drug combinations to avoid, how to notice negative side effects and what aspects of the drugging to ascribe them to, etc.A professional will not necessarily do a great job at all, and thousands upon thousands of patients experience preventable harms and death because of how the mental healthcare system is run at the moment. However, this is not something you want to do without professional consultation—especially good professional consultation. If you are desperate and determine to do something about your experiences, focusing on the non-pharmaceutical methods until you can access a psychiatrist or other kind of competently prescribing doctor is probably the best idea.Some psychiatrists, to note, are available by telephone or videoconference. It is not the most reliable or responsible way to evaluate patients or prescribe drugs, but even that would be better than ‘flying blind’ in the professional sense. There are also free, low-cost, or sliding-scale psychiatric practices in many areas, though this may not be an option for you still.And, to be clear, I am not a healthcare professional, either. This is just lay commentary from someone who has dealt with many providers, facilities, conditions, drugs, and patients.
is knee pain in a 20 year old girl normal	is it normal for a 14 year old girl to be spitting up blood	0	There are several possibilities. One common issue with air travel is DVT - Deep Vein Thrombosis, commonly called blood clots. A blood clot may interfere with circulation and result in pain. Another possible issue is a bone spur or arthritis. It is commonly assumed that you can't have arthritis because of your age. I was diagnosed with arthritis at a younger age than you currently are and had symptoms that were ignored for many years at that time. There are many kinds of arthritis and many of them are not restricted to older people.There are other possibilities, but those are two that I am familiar with because I have both. I am not a doctor and I am not qualified to express an opinion on other possibilities. Whatever is causing your pain needs to have a doctor’s examination to evaluate. Don't ignore pain. Pain is one of your body's only methods of warning you that a problem exists. The problem may be easily remedied or it may be a warning of something much more serious. Early identification of a problem can save your life or prevent the problem from getting worse. So see a doctor as soon as possible.	Hmm. Okay, so everyone here has given the scary answers, there are other possibilities, mainly, the reason it occasionally happens to me: AllergiesI have pretty strong environmental allergies, and because of that, I have post nasal drip. Mmmm, it’s when the mucous from your nasal passages drip onto the back of your throat. This can make your throat feel scratchy, phlegmy, and just gross. It makes me want to do that disgusting phlegm-sucking noise and spit.If your nasal passage is really irritated, it might be bleeding slightly, and that’s what you’re seeing. If your throat/back of your mouth is very irritated from the constant dripping, it could be mildly bleeding.Post-nasal drip happens mostly at night because of the reclining position, and it isn’t always allergy related (though it’s almost never anything serious).Whatever the cause might be, go get checked out, I just wanted to throw a more normal, less scary option out there.
what are the qualities of a good leader	what are some good qualities of a leader	1	I firstly would like to mention: Perception. If you have a workaround how to think things from different perspectives, you can be an effective leader.I will list down the absolute qualities I can, and then state relevant examples of people who have been a good leader with respect to the qualities that I apprehend.The first quality I think a good leader must have, on the contrary, is being a good team member. No one respects a leader who is not himself a good team member but forces or implicates things on the followers. MS DHONI focuses his mindset mostly around starting with fitness. He calls on every member of the team to stay at the fittest level they can, and no one can even think of denying the fact, that he indeed is one of the fittest players Indian team has ever had.2. The second quality I would suggest is VISION. If every member becomes someone who has a vision, then it will be a problem. You need the thinkers and the doer’s, and leaders presumably fall in the first category. I must make it clear that I here don’t mean the reverse can’t be true: Every good leader must have VISION doesn’t mean, team members don’t need vision.The true power of VISION can be effective in settling down the scope of leadership, and how overall leader-follower working is gonna follow.I have dozens of leaders with good examples of VISION: Steve Jobs, Bill Gates(Arguably), Sundar Pichai, Larry Page and so on….3. The third quality every leader must have is a fighting spirit, which must mathematically be more than or equal to the unnerving spirit of each member of the team. I know its difficult to comprehend this directly but think about it. The followers will never retreat a leader who has such a fighting spirit, who can go to any extremes for the right principles, and the best example of such leader can be Nelson Mandela or maybe Sir Alex Ferguson, people who had literally remained calm in the worst of their times, possessed the fighting spirit that was needed for stability of their factions, and later on revolutionized their respective fields.4. The fourth quality a leader must definitely possess is incredible passion, you don’t follow someone who can’t follow their own passion. I think the example of Elon Musk is more than enough for this point. Probably, a million haters were invisible to him because of his passion to do what he wants to do.5. The fifth quality a leader must possess according to me is knowing the potential of their followers. I will quote this: “ A good leader doesn’t need to be the smartest person of the faction, but someone who knows who is the smartest”. A leader is not only someone who realizes the potential his team carries but someone who drives to push these limits either, by inspiration or direct influence. If a leader master’s this art, he can further achieve to more attributes very easily: a. Delegation of tasks and b. Network establishment.A leader must also have other typical qualities like perseverance, knowing when to be patient and when to be aggressive, strategizing ability and also ability to formulate rules that sound fair to everyone.“Remember, great leaders aren’t born natural, they become great in their journey”.	I’ve met many leaders in my life, and they all share similar traits. Sure, we do things a bit differently here and there, but for the most part, we’re alike. Are leaders born with these traits? I think partly, yes. I have known many young men who grew up similarly to me — the same backgrounds, the same country — who weren’t able to translate what they wanted into what they became.Perhaps half nature and half sheer force of will make leaders a bit different than those who just follow. Regardless, all of them I have met possess at least 9 traits.1. Optimism —All it takes is one negative person to infiltrate ten positive people. Sometimes positivity is harder to spread than negativity. Instead of getting bogged down by what isn’t working, leaders rise up to the occasion and inspire positivity. When it’s hard to know what is coming, it’s easy to want to give up. Those who lead persevere, partially because they don’t know how not to. It’s not their natural response.Not only does positivity lead people, it motivates them to mirror who is leading.2. Intuition —When an employee or a project is leading towards a lost cause, I know it before it happens. But I’m not psychic; I’m intuitive, and there is a difference. How I have become intuitive is something that I learned from an early age–to always prepare for what’s to come. In business, I keep my hands and eyes on everything that happens in my company. Since ARETI is a large company and I cannot be everywhere at once, I make sure to hire people I can trust to report back to me.3. Generosity —As a businessman and leader, I try to be generous with people and my community, which is why I push my employees to give to charity and take part in philanthropic initiatives. By being philanthropic, I think I make my employees want to be as well. Research shows that a socially conscientious employer makes for happier employees overall.Aside from fostering a sense of generosity from my company and those around me, leaders can be generous by listening those who have great ideas or present solutions when others are presenting problems. Having an open-door policy at work is a great way to let people know that you are listening and present day-to-day.4. Decisiveness —An indecisive person will fail as a leader. It’s as simple as that. They may move up the ranks in their company because they are competent but they will not have the ability to lead anyone anywhere. Everyone needs to know that the final decision comes from the top (meaning you), or someone else will take the helm. Or worse, the venture, project, or company will fail from being in constant flux. A leader in constant conversation with his or herself is set to be stuck in a back and forth where it is impossible to lead anything anywhere positive.5. Charisma —An important thing that thought leaders have is being able to speak in public. Many cite public speaking as their number one worst fear — about 40% of them. But if that 40% want to become leaders, they’ll have to overcome that. When I think about those who have been the most memorable leaders, I recall the likes of Elon Musk, Steve Jobs, and Winston Churchill. What makes them powerful public speakers (and leaders) is their ability to evoke passions from those they are speaking to, and they do it with charisma. Some people are born with it, but like public speaking, even charisma can be learned. I suggest you do so.If you want to be persuasive — something I’ve often had to be with investors, business partners, and employees — remember that charisma is #1.6. Restlessness —The feeling of restlessness causes a leader to become kinetic, which is a time of great possibilities. When leaders feel restless, it is a time when they aim to do more and become more innovative. Instead of complacency, they are always on the precipice of something better than what’s come before. Leaders never stop thinking or doing.Though a previously mentioned leader like Apple’s Steve Jobs was known to be unrelenting to his staff, he was always striving, always learning, and extracted excellence from both his staff and his products. With his constant frenetic, restless mind, he created not just a business, but also an iconic empire.7. Integrity —People mimic the leaders, so it’s vital that you display honesty. As much as possible, leaders use transparency to garner trust. Without trust, it’s nearly impossible to lead a company towards a successful venture. Those who trust their bosses tend to be more productive, making them better, more dependable employees. Honest leaders create a solutions-oriented staff and company.8. Emotional Stability —When you’re starting or managing a business, unexpected things will happen, but it is how you react to challenges that make you either a leader, or an emotionally immature dreamer. All the traits of a leader I’ve mentioned so far are ones of action, but there is also the strength that comes from inaction. If a leader reacts to every crisis that arises, the company is consistently in chaos.In fact, according to a survey conducted by the Journal of Applied Psychology, “[…] out of the Big Five personality traits, only emotional stability and extraversion significantly predicted people’s ability to cope with change.”By not acting and not reacting immediately upon every dissatisfying situation, he or she conveys a sense of inner wisdom — something many employees I eventually let go didn’t have.9. Daring —Breaking the rules and setting new trends is something I and so many people in my position exhibit. From Richard Branson to the first-time startup founder pitching to Silicon Valley VC firms, fearlessness is essential if not the most important thing a leader must possess. Without risk, there is complacency, and with complacency comes decline. Great leaders are always moving which is what creates the distance from them to the rest of the pack.Final Thoughts:I believe great leaders are often born with these 9 leadership traits, but with hard work, these traits can be learned if applied and practiced in your everyday life. Once this practice becomes a regular habit, you’re well on your way to leading instead of falling behind.Read more on my blog: 9 Traits of a Good Leader.
what is the difference between bay gulf and straits	what exactly is the difference between a sea and a bay	0	Bay: a body of water causing indentation of a shoreline larger than a cove but smaller than a gulfGulf> bay> coveBay is a body of water surrounded by land on three sidesBay and gulf are formed from a single water body whereas a strait involves 2 water bodies.Example: port Philip bay, Melbourne, Australia. Here the water body is the southern ocean( Indian ocean)Gulf: large bay that is an arm of an ocean or seaGulf of CarpentariaWater body- arafura seaGulf of Mexico-atlantic oceanGreat Australian bight- an open bay-Indian ocean or southern ocean.Strait : narrow passage of water connecting two large seas or oceans or water bodiesEg: Palk straitConnects bay of Bengal & park bay with the gulf of Mannar. Two water bodies connected are bay of Bengal and laccadive sea in the Indian oceanStrait of Gibraltar- very famous one connecting Atlantic ocean and the Mediterranean seaSo bay- smaller than gulf. A part of an ocean or sea enclosed by land on 3 sides.Thanks to the internet. Very good information. Thank you for this interesting question. I learnt more..	In geographical terms both bay and sea are marginal water bodies, surrounded by land but not completely land locked (otherwise it will become lake).Now coming to question, there is no difference in both, both are used interchangeably.One may argue that Bay are smaller than sea, but Bay of Bengal is much bigger than dead sea. If someone argues that Bay is bigger than sea than Arabian sea is bigger than Bay of Fundy. If Bay has to be landlocked specifically from 3 sides than Red sea should be termed as Bay which is not the case. I hope this clears your doubt.Moreover, sea is sometimes misnomer as Caspian sea, dead sea etc despite of being landlocked are designated as sea, which is wrong geographically. As in the earlier ages, they were named as sea, therefore they are continued to be called as sea (going with same logic, Lake Baikal is bigger than dead sea and it is landlocked same as the former but still designated as lake).
will modi win in 2019	can narendra modi become prime minister of india in 2019	1	He will not win 2019 general election but he will definitely win 2021 election.Reason Why, He will lose 2019 general election.Uttar Pradesh has 80 Loksabha. In U.P. Trio of Congress, S.P., Mayawati. BJP Strategy is to divide Dalit & Muslim vote bank. Now, It will hard for Amit shah to divide vote & win seats.Now, Bihar has 40 seats. Here duo of Congress & Lalu Prasad Yadav will work. Dalit have 16 % vote bank & Muslim has 17% of vote bank & Yadav’s. Lalu have hold over these Vote. Muslim vote always divide between Congress & RJD. As they will come together they will have majority of seats.Now State like West Bengal, Kerala, Tamil Nadu where BJP has bare minimum presence. Consist of 42,20,39 Seats respectively.Now BJP has to work over 366 seats to get into power. Now, Andhra pradesh , Telangana, Odhisa have strong presence of local party.It will be very hard for BJP to manage & win over 366 seats. It will be hard to Win.Now, After 2019 election , Prime minister equation will come in politics. Party which won highest no. of seats will be Prime minister. Mulayam , Mamta, Tejaswani yadav, Rahul Gandhi will front end contender. If our Luck favour us Politician like Chandrababu Naidu may get top post. Modi or Amit shah will be opposition leader they will not move to Gujarat because they know it is “Chand dino ki sarkar” ( Few days Government”).History will repeat itself.As in 1996 HD Devegowda rule’s 324 days government. Mulayam will rule 324 days government.As in 1997 Indra kumar gujral has rule 332 days government Mamta will rule 332 days government.Now, Congress will go to president to resign from government. Because there Supreme Leader Rahul Gandhi is not getting chance to become Prime minister.How it will affect our Economy?Inaction of government will halt many infrastructure project.Due to this FDI will hit all time low.Share market will tumble.GDP growth will decrease.How it will affect our foreign relation?Israel will be ignored to please vote bank.USA will be ignored because of Trump.With resignation of Congress, ECI will announce date of election. This time Modi will win election. All work which is stalled will resume. We might again see some Hard decision like Demonetization & some poor implementation like GST & Demonetization. But we will be building foreign Military base in Assumption Island, Sabang Island. We might see some of worst decision but some of the best decision but it will be much better than Inaction.In 2026, general election Modi will again loose election. Modi will retire from Politics as Vajpayee did. UPA will form government, Rahul Gandhi will be Prime minister. UPA I will be benefited with work done by Modi. Then, UPA II will come one of the worst ruling government.We will say we should have voted for Modi 2026 as well. As we say for P.v. Narshima rao, Vajpayee. We will say for Modi as well.Edit 1Guys, I am not astrologer who can predict future. I have written my answer based on facts, used some satire by comparing possible future scenario & history.	"No, Modi will never become Prime minister of India again. India is in fire under the time period of Narendra Modi. The hatred between Hindu and Muslim is rising and people in fear that riot can take place anytime in India.Kashmir is under the fire and Narendra Modi led government is failed to create peace in Kashmir which has damaged earning & tourism of Kashmir.Narendra Modi led government has damaged the relationship with neighbor countries. For example is china and Pakistan. China is threatening India every other week and no one is creating peace talk.Maaovadis (Maoists) are in news in every other month, killing our soldiers and situation is out of control.Narendra Modi’s demonetization indirectly killed many poor in queue and did not control for what it was launched. Terrorism is still breeding in Kashmir, Maoist are still killing our soldiers, fake currency are still getting caught around the country. This is all in news, people can google anytime. Under the demonetization period, one person Mahesh Shah got caught with rupees 13860 Crore and now he is missing. Many consider that demonetization was biggest scam of Indian history.Under the time period of Narendra Modi, news channels have become totally biased and brainwashing people’s mind every other day and creating hate & anger in people for each other. News channel is no more news channel. Many claiming that most of the reporters and news channel has been bought by politicians and targeting what they have told to target.Praveen Togadia is giving hate speeches, every other month and targeting muslims without fear of law & government. Bajrang dal, an extremist group in India has recently slapped a muslim in a mosque in Hisar after the attack on Piligrims of Amarnath Yatra, this kind of situation can lead to riots in India but still Bajrang dal and Praveen togadia is not banned by Narendra Modi government and they are moving freely. Why there is no control ? Bajrang dal recently attacked a police station in Bhopal and freed their leader from that and few police officers got injured in this situation. Even the cops are not safe in today’s India.There are high chances that Dr. Shashi Tharoor is going to be the best and strongest candidate as a Prime Minister of India. Dr. Shashi Tharoor is highly educated than Narendra Modi, he completed his PhD at the age of 22 where Narendra Modi’s still in controversy for his graduation. Even Modi followers love Dr. Shashi Tharoor. Shashi Tharoor is getting targeted again and again because opposition know that Shashi Tharoor can easily destroy the regime of Narendra Modi and why not people of India will love a highly educated man as Prime minister who can speak English and other language without using any technology.Dr. Shashi Tharoor was a pioneer in using social media as an instrument of political interaction. Till 2013 he was India's most-followed politician on Twitter, until being overtaken that year by the current Prime Minister, Narendra Modi. He was the first Indian to reach 10,000 and 100,000 followers on the medium, and currently has 4.2 million followers.Dr. Tharoor is also a recognised authority on India, especially regarding its recent economic transformation and future prospects, globalisation, freedom of the press, human rights, literacy, culture, foreign affairs, cricket and more, and is a compelling and effective speaker, fluent in English, French as well as in Malayalam and Hindi.Source: Dr. Shashi Tharoor's official websiteDr. Tharoor is especially notable for his extraordinary eloquence while speaking, as demonstrated by the immense popularity of his speeches on online platforms such as YouTube. For instance, his speech decrying British Colonialism, delivered at the Oxford Union in 2015 has amassed over 3.9 million views on one site alone, while simultaneously being praised as ground-breaking in various educational institutions in India. Further speeches such as those explaining the importance of ""soft power"" and analyzing the impacts of education in India have garnered over 1,000,000 and two million views respectively.Dr. Tharoor is known for his views on a number of topics including economics, history, governance, and geopolitics due to both his well-regarded educational attainment and his broad experience while at the United Nations. Many note that it is his combination of wit, charm, wry humor, and intelligence that make him accessible and held in high esteem, both in India and abroad.”Honours, awards and international recognition[edit]1976 – Rajika Kripalani Young Journalist Award for the Best Indian Journalist under 30.[74]1990 – Federation of Indian Publishers' Hindustan Times Literary Award for the Best Book of the Year for The Great Indian Novel.[citation needed]1991 – Commonwealth Writers' Prize for the Best Book of the Year in the Eurasian Region, for The Great Indian Novel[74]1998 – Excelsior Award for excellence in literature, Association of Indians in America (AIA) and the Network of Indian Professionals (NetIP).2000 – Doctor of Letters in International Affairs by the University of Puget Sound1998 – Global Leader of Tomorrow, World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland[citation needed]2004 – Pravasi Bharatiya Samman, India's highest honour for non-resident Indians (accepted 20072008 – Doctorate Honoris Causa, University of Bucharest, Romania.2009 – Zakir Hussain Memorial ""Pride of India"" Award.2009 – Inspiration of the Year Award at GQ's Man of the Year Awards.2009 – Hakim Khan Sur Award for National Integration, Maharana of Udaipur.2010 – Sarva Deshiya Prathibha Award, Pazhassiraja Charitable Trust.March 2010 – ""New Age Politician of the Year"" Award, at NDTV's Indian of the Year awards.2010 – Fifth IILM Distinguished Global Thinker Award, New Delhi.2010 – Digital person of the year, Indian Digital Media Awards (IDMA), for popularising the digital medium in India.[78]2013 – First Sree Narayan Guru Global Secular and Peace Award at Thiruvananthapuram.2013 – PETA's ""Person of the YearSource: Shashi Tharoor - WikipediaThe only deserving Prime Minister of India in 2019 is Dr. Shashi Tharoor and no one else."

did swami vivekananda ever eat nonveg or egg during his journey around the world	why do not  most of the hindus eat nonveg	0	"As you know Swami Vivekananda was a Bengali so he must be eating fish, eggs and other non-vegetarian diets . His guru Ramakrishna Paramhans was known to eat fish. If you don't have any idea about Ramakrishna Mission then I would like to share my experience.When I was student aged 18-19 I used to visit Ramakrishna Mission Ashram almost every week and met many sanyasis there. Moreover I visited some section of Ashram which was not meant to be visited by common public.Now I am sharing what I came to know and how Ramakrishna mission is different from other religious organizations and still without any controversy since 1896.There was a fish pond in Ashram and all sanyasis were eating fish. My brother once went there to arrange books in book store and had lunch there. He was served fried fish.Moreover I can found book in Ashram like:""Gay palan kaise kare"" (How to run an animal farm)""Murgi palan kaise kare"" (How to run a poultry farm)""Madumakkhi plan kaise kare"" (How to run a bee farm)So it is obvious that they don't oppose eating non-vegetarian.Unlike other Babas who keep on forcing people to get Diksha from them, I had completely different experience.When I told one swami ji that I want to take ""Diksha"" he asked me ""Diksha lekar kya karoge. Manavta ki sewa sabse badi sewa hai."" (No need to take Diksha, serving mankind is the biggest service)Moreover Once I entered the Ashram there was a board on which it was written that ""Sabhi sampraday ke logo ka swagat hai"" (People of all community irrespective of their religion are welcomed)I had seen muslim & christian to come there for treatment in their charitable dispensaries or to study at library.They never organize any satsang program outside their premises. They never promote people to connect to Ramakrishna Mission or Math.Now Criteria for being a Sanyasi:1. You should not be married/separate/divorcee. 2. You should not be fade up of life and come to Ashram to become a sanyasi.3. You would not keep any relation to your parents/relatives/friends.4. You would never discuss about your previous home once you become a sanyasi.5. You will never join politics.Now see examples of other Babas1. Asaram is married, having kids and running his baba business2. Many babas have families which they left.3. They keep relation to their old home4. They never hide their old home5. They join politics. Example: Satpal Maharaj, Yogi Adityanath, Uma Bharti etc.Moreover Swami Vivekananda never objected any of Hindu rituals. Even he alwasy supported idolatry. No where in Hindu religion books it is mentioned that Hindus were vegetarians. Concept of vegetarianism came as an effect of Jainism.On every demise of President of Ramakrishna Mission and Math I see news that PM and President of India pay his condolences.Mahasamadhi of Srimat Swami Ranganathanandaji Maharaj""On his demise, condolence messages were received from Dr A P J Abdul Kalam, President of India, Dr Manmohan Singh, Prime Minister of India, Smt Sonia Gandhi, President, All-India Congress Committee, Sri S M Krishna, Governor of Maharashtra, and Sri T N Chaturvedi, Governor of Karnataka. Sri Gopalkrishna Gandhi and Sri Buddhadev Bhattacharya, Governor and Chief Minister of West Bengal, also paid their homage. Messages also poured in from many other Indian and foreign dignitaries, officials, organizations and individuals from different walks of life. Sri I K Gujral, former Prime Minister of India, and Sri L K Advani, former Deputy Prime Minister of India, wrote articles in eminent dailies about their association with Revered Maharaj and his great contribution to the social and spiritual welfare of humanity. On the 26th, the Rajya Sabha and Lok Sabha (the upper and lower houses of the Indian Parliament) paid homage to Revered Maharaj by standing in silence for a short while as a mark of respect to his memory. The press, All-India Radio and Doordarshan gave extensive coverage. Newspapers in Bangladesh also published the news of his demise prominently."""	Because of personal interpretations of the religion. Many Hindus are vegetarian, not because of some humanitarian ideal but because of certain requirements of some religious practices and rituals. I know this statement is controversial but let me explain.Hinduism by itself does not promote or prohibit any particular type of food types. Any compulsion is primarily driven by the religious practices of the individual involved. In serious religious practice, there is a concept of “Ahimsa”. This not only means following vegetarian food but also non-violent thoughts.Why vegetarianism is preferred? Humans have a lot of hormones common with other animals but don't have many commons with the plants. When we consume meat, we will be exposed to many hormones like adrenaline, testosterone, progesterone and others depending on the animal that we eat. Now, if you look at the physical and emotional effects of these hormones on human body you will understand that eating meat will cause these effects to be artificially induced in the body. Also the amount of these hormones produced in the human body is different from the ones produced in different animals. Larger animals tend to produce larger quantities of these hormones. To this effect, even some plants are prohibited like garlic, onions, etc. There tend to have elements that negatively impact the emotional health of a human.Now, in Hinduism, we have traditions which require years of strict meditation practices with unwavering mental balance and discipline. Imagine how difficult or impossible would it be to meditate if the practitioner has eaten an animal with some quantity of adrenaline. This would be absorbed by the human body and depending on the quantity will cause emotional turmoil in the body and mind. How successful will that person in the meditation? As plants do not have many hormones matching with the humans, what would happen if the person is eating plants instead of animals during this religious practice. Just by the logic, you should improve the success rate drastically by following a vegetarian diet.Humans are also social animals. They will tend to get influenced by their peers or surrounding, sometime called “social engineering”. Due to the interaction with other humans there is possibility of aggressive thoughts like anger, lust, jealousy, etc. This prevents people from developing revolutionary ideas and thinking out of the box solutions. To this end, some serious practitioners are even know to isolate themselves from normal public life (ascetics) and move to forests. Once their research is done, they come to public life and share the goodies of their knowledge with commoners. These ascetics are called Rishis.Now, when commoners come in contact with the Rishis and their advanced knowledge, they tend to misunderstand their food preferences to be the reason for the advancement. Common people try to imitate these great people based on their food habits as it is the most evident factor. Now a days, these imitation has risen to fanatic levels and they are even ready to hurt others who do not comply with their norm. In doing that they follow a strict vegetarian diet but a violent thought, which fails the primary tenant of Ahimsa.Vegetarianism was not compulsory for commoners, it is only advised for Rishis as it makes their path easier to achieve. Just like every tradition if followed without understanding the underlying reason becomes superstition, the vegetarianism has also become superstitious.If you are a Hindu, you only need to be a vegetarian if it is necessary for your occupation or purpose of your life. Otherwise, you can follow your taste.
what will happen if i cancel tqwl tickets before the charting is done	can we cancel a tatkal waiting list ticket	0	Even if you don’t cancel your TQWL tickets, you will get a refund, so it’s better not to waste your time in cancelling it.But if you have booked the ticket through counter, you need to cancel it in order to get the refund. In case of a booking through IRCTC, you don’t have to worry abut cancelling the WL ticket. It will automatically get cancelled and you will get the refund.	yes obviously you canTatkal ticket Cancellation RulesIf you get confirmed Tatkal ticket for all reserved class (sleeper/1AC/2AC/3AC) no money will be refunded for cancellation of ticket and this is valid for both window ticket as well as online site booked ticket and obviously you get refund of money for cancellation of waiting tatkal ticket.If you get tatkal waiting list ticket online:1) You can generate cancellation request through irctc online.2) Or also if it not get confirmed and chart prepared it will be automatically get cancelIn both of the above cases the money will be refunded to the account by which you make payment for the tickets within a week. One notable thing that you will lose same IRCTC service charges (sleeper/2S -₹20 and for AC-₹40) in both the cases.But when ticket automatically get cancelled after chart preparation you will also get refund of your flat cancellation charges (1AC-₹120, 2AC-₹100, 3AC-₹90, Sleeper-₹60, 2S-₹30).If you get tatkal waiting list ticket from window:You can ask TT for a seat, you can enjoy your whole journey standing in train or if you have your other friends with confirmed ticket you can enjoy with them too and it is officially allowed. Simply your ticket will not get automatically cancelled if you want to cancel it you have to reach nearby railway station (preferred from you taken that ticket) generate a cancellation there on a provided cancellation form. You may be given refunded money hand to hand or maybe they tell you the place, date and time for collecting your refunded money.Note : Answer may be now outdated with change in price and other rules.

how do i choose a journal to publish my paper	where do i publish my paper	1	How do you go from nothing to a published research paper? The first and most important step is the least glamorous: Read, Read, and Read. You cannot go anywhere without first doing a thorough review of the literature. You picked a topic: now go to the library or to Google Scholar or something and read everything you can about that topic. Everything. This serves two purposes: you learn what research has already been done, and you get a foundation in your topic that will help you come up with a question and design your project. In the course of your readings you may come up with a question. Search for articles that may answer that question and, if you don't find any, keep searching a few more times just to be sure and, if you still don't find any, congratulations! You have a topic. Now do some research on methods that could be used to answer your question, and you're ready to start your experiments.Experiments done? Good. See which papers you read are close to the one you want to write, find the journal they were published in, see their submissiob guidelines, and write accordingly.Don't ever expect to be done with the reading, by the way: new research is always coming out, so reading literature is something you will be doing forever. If it's a topic you enjoy, however, you won't mind.While you're doing this, be sure to take notes! You will be citing all of these sources when you write your research paper, so be sure to record the citation information and the findings and useful information from each paper you read. I use Endnote, but there is other citation software out there.To give you an idea, in the past four years I have read (or at least skimmed or saw the abstract of) nearly 1000 papers related in some way to my research topic or methods, and another 150 on a side topic, and 75 on another side project. For a large review paper I wrote on yet another side topic, I read nearly 400 papers. I didn't / won't cite all of these in the papers I write (most papers have 30-40 citations or so), but to get enough information to know what has been done, what needs to be done, and how to do it all I have had to read a lot, and continue to do so.~~~Besides the literature review, running your experiment, writing and submitting of the paper, and the waiting while it gets reviewed and hopefully accepted for publication will take a long time. Your 4-6 month timeline is quite unrealistic unless you are doing something in the humanities or writing a review or commentary where lab work isn't needed.

what do you do if you had a bad dream	how do you not get bad dreams	0	"If you aren't having bad dreams a lot (in which case, talk to a therapist), there are several things that can help afterward:...write out or draw (simple stick figures/etc totally fine) an alternative for the bad part of the dream, or add something to happen just after that part that would change the ending; you can use something that could have been a different way of reacting/etc in the dream, or just totally make up something ...you can also tell that alternative to someone, but writing or drawing may work even better for your brain...tell someone you trust about the bad dream; then hopefully talk about little bits of the dream as well as the big parts...doing that can just make the feelings less horrible, but if you discuss/analyze the bits your brain may float up things that ""remind you of"" which could be situations that actually caused the dream and its feelings in the first place so you can understand where the general feelings might have come from (knowledge is comforting and power)...just draw little bits of the dream (any images at all, small or large, and from the bad parts of the dream or other parts)...there's something about doing that that can help; perhaps doing that (like some of the other strategies above) has put you in control of them even if just drawing or speaking them, and also anything you ""concretize"" by putting out in the world from your brain helps keep it from going round-and-round in your head and also does other good thingsBefore you go to bed, you can also try to avoid having the last thing on your mind be something unpleasant and/or where you don't have reasonable control. If that's a problem, try proactively to think of opposite things (or better, jot them down on a pad beside your bed or even earlier in the day) at that time. You can think of situations that would make you happy or ones where you were happy or things you'd like to explore, for example, etc. Doing that kind of thing right before bed kind of sets your brain in that mode, and some people feel you can even ""ask"" your brain to dream about certain things by doing it.Of course, also don't do things right before bed like eating a large meal; exercising; watching screens and/or especially violent, active or conflict-laden things; etc."	The common knowledge holds true, that nightmares are often a reflection of your waking mentalStressing about a looming unpleasantness, as well as anxiety from events passed can cause nightmares. Really traumatic events like car accidents or wars can lead to nightmares with recurring themes, or reliving the event over and over. Healing from the trauma should cause the nightmares to become less frequent and intense over time.If you’re among the 5% of people who have nightmares often enough to affect your waking hours, consider seeing a therapist.Nightmares can also be caused by medications or drugs, especially ones that affect neurotransmitters like antidepressants or narcotics.People who have what psychologists define as “thin boundaries of the mind” are more prone to nightmares too. These people tend to be more creative and imaginative, and sometimes have trouble separating fantasy from reality. There are also idiopathic nightmares, meaning we don’t know why they happen, they just do.So if you have a nightmare every now and again, it’s nothing to worry about. 85% of adults report having nightmares on occasion. They’re more common for children, particularly young girls, and are likely caused when the child is struggling to cope with normal childhood fears.To understand nightmares, and to a larger extent dreams, it helps to know what’s happening in your thinking meat while you’re unconscious. Dreams and nightmares happen during REM (Rapid eye movement ), the last step in the sleep cycle before it starts over. During REM your brain becomes much more active than when you’re in deep sleep.Your amygdala in your temporal cortex starts humming along during REM, and that little guy is responsible for processing memory, decisions, and emotional reactions. And nightmares are a normal part of sleepIf you wake up due to nightmares more often that you’d like, or if you’re struggling to shake them off, there are a few things you can try to banish them from your bedroomStamp out your stress: try some belly breathing or meditation before bed.Don’t eat before bed: food can speed up your metabolism, which makes your brain more active during sleep.Stay away from scary stories, horror movies and these days… the night time news!Keep a consistent bedtime routineGo to sleep and wake up at the same time each dayEnsure your bedroom is cool, dark and quiet
why do slavs squat	do squats work for men	0	"I'll try to be serious and answer this question the best way I can. I have never heard of this internet phenomenon of ""Slav squatting"" until now, and I find it absolutely hilarious. I thought the whole world was squatting just like we are. You may laugh, but I am actually squatting on my chair while writing this. Now to the point. I will write from my point of view, and I don't know if it applies to the other people (Slavic people).First thing first: squatting simply feels comfortable for me. I lay my feet flat on the ground, my knees bent, and I rest my whole upper body on my knees and hamstrings. Sometimes I also squat on balls of my feet, putting few of my fingers on the ground for aditional stability.Sadly, most present day teenage and adult Slavs grew up in impoverished post-socialist countries. There were no videogames, and we didn't spent much time watching TV (There were only 3 channels in my country, none of them for the kids). We spent our time in parks and outdoors running, playing soccer, immitating cowboys and Indians, playing war games, and doing other silly things that (Slavic) kids do. When you get tired, you could either sit on the ground, as most parks and playgrounds didn't have benches, and get dirty, or squat. So squatting came naturally and became a habit for most kids.Also, most toilets in schools were squatting toilets, so that had some influence too. Even today I squat on my modern flush toilet. It simply feels better.Now for the photo thing. That comes from the pure utility: class photos were taken every year, and to make whole class of 30 student fit in one photo, boys were usually squatting in the first row, and girls were standing behind them in the second row. So the boys gained habit of taking photos in squatting position. Eventually, it became cool to take photos while squatting.I am sorry for my bad english, and I hope I gave you some insight on this squatting habit of ours."	Squats are arguably the single greatest exercise any man can do. When the load is significant, essentially every muscle in the body is called upon to move the weight through the range of motion. The hamstrings, quads and glutes are the primary movers, while the core, upper, lower back and shoulders are forced to remain in a solid isometric state throughout the movement. A boost in testosterone is a nice effect of frequent heavy, deep squatting as well as a big hit on the cardiovascular system and mental toughness. Squats force you to dig deep. They are the single greatest exercise for athletic ability and they are hugely beneficial for overall health. The style of squat can be mixed up frequently to maximize the benefits. Hit back squats, low-bar squats, front squats, zercher squats with a barbell. Grab some kettlebells for double front racked squats or a single kettlebell goblet squat. Take a heavy sandbag for some zerchers, bear hug squats or some unilateral shoulder squats. Hell, even use a log... So, squat deep. Squat often and don't be afraid of squatting heavy. ​​
how many marks should i score for aiims rank 151	what minimum marks should i score to get among top 50 in aiims	0	This year aiims paper was on the tougher side as compared to previous years…physics was the toughest…as the pattern was competely changed..physics questions were mostly conceptual ..but this year they were very lengthy and calculative…Chem n bio were comparitively very easy..gk was also very easy…assertion n reason,which were of average difficulty(becoz u can not be sure of a perfect ans.) may decide the cutoff this year..Due to above rsns…To score a rank below 150…u should get 130+…All the best	What's wrong with being in the top 5? Why not work for that?You need to score more than 70% in the entrance examination to be in the top 5. Work for it. Even you are pushed below, you will still be in top 10. The aim is to be in the race and not to be kicked out of it.Best wishes :)
in an operating room when two surgeons of equal experience disagree on a surgical procedure how is the tie broken	doctors how do surgeons hold out on surgeries more than 6 hours long do they rest during the operation	0	In thirty years I have never experienced the scenario you purpose. There is always a “lead” surgeon on a case who may not be the most experienced but there is always an implied “captain of the ship.” My first real “captain…” experience was when I was on faculty where I trained in general surgery. The Chief of Surgery was a man named John Kirklin who I respected greatly and was the world’s leading pediatric cardiovascular surgeon of his day. He referred a baby to me whose sternum opened exposing his little heart for me to repair. He asked if I would consent to using his OR and operative team for the procedure; which I did. We scrubbed together and talked bout my plan. As we both entered the OR, as I had done hundreds of times as a resident, his team insisted of gowning and gloving me first and directed me to the patient’s right side; the side where the operating surgeon stands. He was the perfect first assistant as we used the babies’ pectoralis muscles to cover his exposed heart. At the end of the case he was effusive with his praise and I realized I had passed the ultimate test for a trainee. Dr. Kirklin realized that there could only be one captain, and for this baby it was me.	"I'll toss in some of my 3 cents as well on hugely long cases.  People somehow tend to think the OR is a quiet and serene place; depending on the surgeon who is technically in control (not the anesthesiologist), it might be totally the opposite. In my OR I have music playing. We talk constantly about ""stuff,"" not necessarily about the procedure.  If the surgery is long but ""routine"" (and many of mine are), we tend to not even notice the time flying by.  If the procedure is not common, then we tend to flip and things get real quiet, so much so that everyone comments about it.  I even know of surgeons who have an RN start a IV in them so they don't dehydrate and lose focus or have to stop.  NOT ME!  For me, I had a special ""chair"" made that allows my weight to be shifted forward onto my ribs so I don't have it all on my back (my back is shot).   I also scrub out routinely for potty breaks and even have food brought up so staff can eat.  The staff rotate in and out so they don't get too stressed.  For me the worst thing is not having my staff up to par.  If my staff are playing their A game then things go smoothly, so I do everything I can to make sure that happens.  No staff stress allowed!  I also do not allow Administration/Managers in the room.  I have my staff (made up of a half a dozen nurses and techs) plus the general run-of-the-mill staff, whoever is assigned, plus my resident(s), plus the anesthesia team.  Simple rule is if you can't play your A game, no penalties, no concern—just scrub out and the others will take over.  They still get paid, they don't get yelled at, but at least they don't stress ME out, and the patient never suffers.  I also wear super comfortable clothes and shoes.  My ""chair,"" actually a leaner, has wheels so I roll all around, which I sometimes do to drive the gals crazy.  To me no expense is too great for the team since we do this 60-70 hours a week.  If staff want loupes they get them. If they want headlights they get them as well.  Special gloves—done. Special masks or bubbles—done.  I think the OR needs to be treated like a real theater with the team being actors in various roles.  My OR is dead serious but definitely a comedy/drama.  When I started (before the advent of staff litigation), we all used to ""act"" and talk just like we would at a BBQ or social event.  Jokes, stories, etc.  Now we need to tone it down a bit since some jokes are deemed inappropriate and the legal eagles frown on staff litigation.  Way too much TV and Hollywood has been imposed on the OR suite. It simply isn't true.  The only part that IS true is the grilling of the residents at the beginning of each case.  I want to make sure mine know what we are doing and I bust some buns on basics. Then, after that is done, we are just co-workers doing a job.  I also mandate that my patients are moved every 40 minutes so they don't get pinched nerves, occluded vessels, skin abrasions, blood clots, or the like.  We simply back up and let the nurses who are not operating along with the anesthesia team move the patient and we step (or roll) back in and start back up again.  This gives everyone a little break. —Dr Dave"
how many months does it take to gain knowledge in developing android apps from scratch	how much time does it take to learn android app development from scratch	1	Here is My Experience: My first appI am a Third year, Computer Science Engineering student in Bangalore(as on 17/09/2016).After my second year,I decided to Learn Android in the 60 days holidays.55 Days Left: Realised that I need Java to Learn Android.45 Days Left: So learnt Basic java and started with android.30 Days Left: Learnt Basic android,enough to start a project.I started making an application which manages your expenditures, as i had to get my expenses under control. I started making the app, I Lost my sleep..kept coding and designing whenever i am at home. Whenever I was out, I kept thinking about the features and the things which will attract the users. Believe me Guys… I threw everything at it. Barely 4hrs of sleep everyday.10 Days Left: App was Complete for testing,Uploaded it to my google drive..sent invites for downloading.I got feedbacks and Many bugs.. Then I Started to implement the feedbacks and remove these bugs.1 Day Left: App Was not complete..!!! It required more of my time and much more effort. I decided to give it all I have left in me.8 Days after college Reopens: My app was ready.! Finally.!!! I convinced my dad and my mom to upload it to the Google App Store.

how do i love my body as a guy	how can i make my whole body more fair if i am a wheatish indian guy	0	Do you have legs? what would you do without them? You wouldn't be able to walk, play sports, run, etc. Love your legs.Do you have arms? what would you do without them? You wouldn't be able to reach across the dinner table. You wouldn't be able to defend yourself in a fight. Love your arms. Love your fingers, nails, knuckles, and your ear lobes. Yes, love your ear lobes too.Are you worried about scars or pimples? some people don't even have a face because of acid attacks or genetic mutations. Love your skin.Are you worried about size? Tell yourself that you're very handsome and brave everyday. Compliment yourself once in a while.Your body is a temple, honor it.	Why would you? People in the west are trying to get themselves tanned and people in the east are trying to become fairer !! I have always wondered why ;) Your mind would be more beautiful than your body would ever be. Take it as such. If you still want to, don't expose yourself much to sun. You can try bathing with besan flour. You can use orange peels or lemon peels to exfoliate your skin.
what are the rights of a prisoner	if i am in prison what rights would i have	1	"I am an expert on religious rights in prison.  They are extensive, but still have limitations.  Native Americans can't have peyote.  Rastafarian inmates can't have weed.  Muslims can't have congregational prayer five times a day (they may get together in the Chapel once or twice).  Custody levels normally kept separate cannot combine for Jumah prayer.  Asatru cannot use swords and war hammers, and Nazi symbolism is out.  Wiccans can't have an ritual dagger; neither can the Sikhs(tiny, 1"", daggers attached to a block of wood are sometimes allowed).  Religious head wear that does not obscure the face is usually allowed (a Rasta crown, a Jewish kippa, a Muslim kufi).  Jumah prayer will occur every Friday at mid day except during lock downs, even if hundreds are involved.  Ramadan will be observed, and the prison will go to great pains to make it happen.  Native American sweat lodge ceremonies will take place with regularity, with all expense paid by the government.  The complex I supervised, four prisons, used a cord of wood each week (mixed hardwood, about $300 here in the desert).  Oh, and we dispensed tobacco for the ceremonies, in a tobacco free institution, because the right to use it is part of the rights retained by Native Americans."

my exgirlfriend is suffering from malaria i have a deep urge of visiting her but i have my placements on i have no idea how to be with her what should i do	should i be worried that my girlfriend texts her exboyfriend till 4 am and if so why	0	"Before reaching to conclusion take note of this points:Malaria won't kill her. Your placements are not going to happen again through college.Just for your sympathy word ""ex"" is not going to fall off from ""ex-girlfriend"".So make logical decision instead of emotional one. Perhaps this are my opinion you have open choice."	"Well buddy, the way I see it, you've got two options:1. Decide this doesn't matter to you.

You could let it go, and live happily ever after.But since you posted this, I'm assuming you care enough to go for option2. Ask her about it.Now that that's established, there are two things she could tell you:1. ""It's nothing! You have nothing to worry about. We're just friends, I promise."" In which case, you have no problem. Stop reading. Live happily ever after.If you're still reading, that means it was option2. ""Yeah...still have feelings for him...""Now that you've had your heart ripped out, you have two options:1. Stay with her, work it out, and live happily ever after.But since you seem upset by this already, I expect you to pursue option 2. Fight. Break up. You don't need this deceit! AAAAAaaa!!!Now that you're alone, you have two options:1. Stay alone, be okay with it, live happily ever after.But since I already know you like being in relationships, I expect you'll go for option2. Meet someone new.Now that you're seeing somebody, one of two things is going on:1. They aren't texting anybody but you at 4. a.m. Live happily ever after!But since you're still here, it leads me to believe (sorry bud) that you're dealing with option 2.

what is the best way to get traffic on your website	how do i get traffic for website	1	Truth?Are you sure you want that?Okay, here it is. There isn’t a best way.There is only…Unless.Unless you create a plan.That plan, your plan, won’t look like every other plan. In fact, it might not look like any other plan.What I DoI have tried many different forms of marketing.None have worked.Except securing organic results from the search engines with those 3 all too familiar abbreviations, SEO.What is SEO?Search engine optimization (SEO) is where you convince Google and other similar sites to rank you at the top in their databases. If you don’t have time to invest in the process, then this won’t work for you.It works for me and works very well.But what other options are available for you to consider moving forward into?Long List of Ways to Market Online1.

AdvertiseThis one is so obvious, we’re going to look at it first. Paid search, social media advertising and display advertising are all excellent ways of attracting visitors, building your brand and getting your site in front of people.2. Get SocialIt’s not enough to produce great content and hope that people find it – you have to be proactive. One of the best ways to increase traffic to your website is to use social media channels to promote your content.3. Mix It UpThere is no magic formula for content marketing success, despite what some would have you believe. For this reason, vary the length and format of your content to make it as appealing.4. Write Irresistible HeadlinesHeadlines are one of the most important parts of your content. Without a compelling headline, even the most comprehensive blog post will go unread. Master the art of headline writing.5. Pay Attention to On-Page SEOThink SEO is dead? Think again. Optimizing your content for search enginesis still a valuable and worthwhile practice. Are you making the most of image alt text? Are you creating internal links to new content? What about meta descriptions? Optimizing for on-page SEO doesn’t have to take ages, and it could help boost your organic traffic.6. Target Long-Tail KeywordsGot your high commercial intent keyword bases covered? Then it’s time to target long-tail keywords, too. Long-tail keywords account for a majority of web searches, meaning that if you’re not targeting them as part of your paid search or SEO efforts, you’re missing out.7. Start Guest BloggingBefore you say it – no, true guest blogging isn’t dead, despite what you may have heard. Securing a guest post on a reputable site can increase blog traffic to your website and help build your brand into the bargain. Be warned, though – standards for guest blogging have changed radically during the past eighteen months, and spammy tactics could result in stiff penalties.8. Post Content to LinkedInLinkedIn has become much more than a means of finding another job. The world’s largest professional social network is now a valuable publishing platform in its own right, which means you should be posting content to LinkedIn on a regular basis.9. Link InternallyThe strength of your link profile isn’t solely determined by how many sites link back to you – it can also be affected by your internal linking structure. When creating and publishing content, be sure to keep an eye out for opportunities for internal links. This not only helps with SEO, but also results in a better, more useful experience for the user – the cornerstone of increasing traffic to your website.10. Interview Industry Thought LeadersThink interviews are only for the big leaguers? You’d be amazed how many people will be willing to talk to you if you just ask them. Send out emails requesting an interview to thought leaders in your industry, and publish the interviews on your blog.Thank you for read.For more head over to: Drive traffic on your website
what are some of the best films and tv shows that feature strong female protagonists	what are the best female strong characters in films	1	Reading the answers already provided, I find myself a little bit frustrated. Many of the female characters chosen are women filling roles typically associated with masculine characters (no nonsense, aggressive, gun-toting bad-asses). These characters are strong, to be sure, but many of them seem to be strong only because they are doing things that male characters typically do. I'd just like to nominate the following women from my favorite American TV drama of all time, The West Wing. Since it was an ensemble cast, none of these characters were technically the protagonist of the stories told on that show, but each displays a strength that is both genuine and rooted in femininity.C.J. Cregg (Allison Janney) for routinely going toe-to-toe with the entire White House press corps.Donna Moss (Janel Maloney) for routinely going toe-to-toe with her boss, the ever-arrogant, ever-brilliant Josh Lyman.Abbey Bartlet (Stockard Channing) for routinely going toe-to-toe with her husband, the President of the United States, Josiah Bartlet.Delores Landingham (Kathryn Joosten) for routinely going toe-to-toe with everyone who walked into the West Wing, not the least of which was her former boss' son, and current boss, President Bartlet. **Sorry.

how far would you go for love should i wait for the one i love ir move on	as a thirteen year old what is the best thing i can do for my health	0	I believe that when you are in love, you forget everything around you and simply try to find happiness when the one you love is happy. Well, I did the following that I would have not done for any other person. (I am a girl)I could never get angry to him even if he was all wrong, I could not say anything negative to him that could possibly hurt him even a little bit.Whenever we were together, I used to eat what he liked. He has no idea about my food liking and I know each and everything that he likes or dislikes.I bought him a shirt that he liked but was not buying because it was too costly according to him. Well, at that time, I was not working, I worked part-time to buy that shirt though I was doing quite a hectic course.I know all of his family and in fact I treat them like my own family.I tried my best to be his support emotionally when he was all depressed because of his parents not agreeing to marry him to his girl friend.I listened to all of his excitement and became a part of his wedding quite actively when he was set to marry his current wife.I am always a call away whenever he needs me. though vice-versa is not true!Even though he could never understand my love for him, and I can never be with him (since he is married now), I have always wanted the best for him.Finally, for his sake, I let go of my feelings long ago as I knew he did not consider me anything more than a friend. I tried to stay away from him, I tried to not contact him, but he always considered me a good friend and I did not want to end that. Also, I never ever wanted to create a problem in his life!Now I say, Love does not only make you blind in your eyes but also in your brains :D	You have just entered your teenage so be prepared to face an awesome and worth remembering phase of your life and experience the best in the coming years. In this age you are turning from a child to an adult so from now you will be developed physically, mentally, emotionally and gain maturity. But to enjoy these changes you need to have a constant and reasonable amount of energy as you grow more. And this is your base age. If you stay feet and healthy at these ages then it will help you in long run and you will enjoy a long life. I would recommend you to exercise daily like morning walk , follow a routinely meal , eat until your stomach is totally full and not partly , join a gym if you like though it's not that much important, play outdoors , don't use electronics too much like computer games or TV or mobiles, eat limited spicy or junk foods , eat non veg (meat, eggs and fish) , drink a glass of milk everyday , if you have time do some meditation it will help you to have concentration and always think positive. At this age you need also to fight certain difficulties like bad friends teaching you bad habits or advising to take drugs or smoke or drink and if it happens consult to your parents immediately and try to stay under the eyes of teachers in school. Remember this age and the rest of teen ages have lots of good opportunities that will develop you and you will be better but there are some holes where if you get trapped your life will be ruined. So talk to your parents as friends and share everything you find awkard or bad and pay attention to your health and studies. Cheers !All the best :-)

what is in bone marrow	what does bone marrow taste like	0	Bone marrow is a spongy tissue that is found in the epiphyseal region of the long bones like femur and humerus and also in the scapula, pelvis, cranium, and ribs.Their main function is to produce RBCs, WBCs, B and T Lymphocytes and other blood cellular components.They contain progenitor cells or hematopoietic stem cells that are initially undifferentiated cells. They give rise to all the blood cellular components. They have a red and yellow marrow, where the red marrow gives rise to the blood cells and is richly supplied with blood vessels whereas the yellow marrow consists of fat deposits.with age the rich red marrow is replaced by the yellow marrow.In the stroma of bone marrow there can be observed osteoblast, fibroblast cells, adipocytes etc.,The B cells originate and mature in the bone marrow hence the bone marrow is considered as the primary lymphoid organ.image courtesy google[1]Footnotes[1] http://google images	"It's about the most delicious thing imaginable.  I like to use it as a dipping goop for bread.  Look, when you think bone marrow, it's easy to see it as somehow gross.  But it's just fat . . . really, uncommonly delicious fat.  If you eat a cheeseburger or a pot roast or sausage or whatever, you're already getting fat as flavor in your food.  Bacon is like 75% fat and people seem to have no concern for eating that variety -- which is fileted off the torso of dead pigs.  I mean, let's face it, no matter how you slice it or dice it, you could ""gross-ify"" any meat product if you like.  But it's all about the fat!  Without fat, meat is usually (though not always) pretty bland.  Bone marrow tastes a bit like butter + beef + umami (whatever that is) and is just all around unctuousy good stuff.  In fact, bone marrow is so delicious, you are getting its flavor in a bunch of stuff that you don't really notice (most of the time).  If you see how broths are made, they're almost always made by cooking bones in with the liquid (to add flavor).  Without that, a good chicken or beef stock is just ""meat water"" with some veggies in it."
were there any slave with the name reddice	in ancient rome slaves were branded what happened with the brand mark if they were subsequently liberated	0	"In general, slaves (in the American South) didn't have last names.  There is a scene in Mark Twain's classic work ""The Adventures of Tom Sawyer,"" in which Tom and Huck are frightened by a dog howling in the middle of the night.  Tom is able to identify the dog, and Twain explains in a footnote. ""Oh, lordy, I'm thankful!"" whispered Tom. ""I know his voice. It's Bull Harbison."" *[* If Mr. Harbison owned a slave named Bull, Tom would have spoken of him as ""Harbison's Bull,"" but a son or a dog of that name was ""Bull Harbison.""] The dog, in other words, actually gets the dignity of the last name.  The slave does not. After Emancipation, as a previous answer points out, many former slaves took their former owners' surnames.  Since there were Irish immigrants in the American South, and some of them were slaveowners, it's entirely possible that there were and are African-American families named ""Dolan"" as a result of their history as slaves of Irish owners. This answer is not intended to speak to the conditions of slavery in countries other than the United States."	Romans didn't brand all slaves - misbehaving or runaway slaves or other special cases.For example, runaway slaves would be branded with FVG (for fugitivus). If these slaves were manumitted, they merely attained the rank of  dediticii, not full freedman status. Presumably they would keep their brands so as to identify them if they came too close to Rome - they could be reenslaved by coming too close to the city.Citizens who had been enslaved as punishment were also branded - though I am unsure of their status following a potential manumission.DediticiiLex Aelia SentiaSlavery in ancient Rome
how long does it take for a dead body to float to the surface after drowning 	when a dead body is in a river how long does it take before it floats	1	The length of time that elapses before the body rises depends not only upon the amount of fat contained in the tissues but on the temperature of the water. If the water is warm, the formation of gas within the body occurs rapidly and the body may rise to the surface in a day or two. However, if the water is cold, bacterial action takes place very slowly and it may take several weeks before the body appears on the surface. When a body is fully distended it is almost impossible to sink even with counter weights.

how do i get over a friend with whom i have not  talked in 3 years but still miss him	how do i get over someone i loved now that we broke up last year and i still miss her	0	3 years.. a friend and you miss him.Are you alone? Do you not have something else to do with your life that can keep you occupied so that you won't worry about missing someone from 3 yrs or 4yrs ago?You can miss a person. Be it as a friend..be it a lover.. but we should not 'worry' about missing them too much. Either you are very lonely and you keep thinking about the past or there is something beyond friendship you feel for the person.(i am guessing)Hence a simple friend is now keeping you worried. Why can't you contact them?What you do when life moves on...people who you care become a part of past? YOU MOVE ON TOO. Because we have a life to live too. Because whoever it is that is haunting you in thoughts, that is hurting you somewhere in the heart with his/her absence is no longer there beside you. I don't want to know why, but they are not really there and not a part of your life. So move on. Say 'It's ok to miss but i have a life to live. They are not here anymore.' to yourself whenever you miss them too much. Take up productive work..or hobbies you love..spend time with people who are willing to be there for you.. This will reduce the missing feeling eventually.	"I was high on weed when my friend asked this same question.My answer was, ""You're probably trying to forget her. Instead, do everything not to remember her.""Now the answer squares up to what are the necessary things you can do. And so the list begins:Following your passion: Following every non materialistic thing that excites you. It can be enrichment of hobbies, sports, going out on vacations. For more input on how to find your passion you can read this. How do I find my passion? I am 24, yet I've still not found the one thing which makes me happy to work on.Noticing every minute detail: Be it watching your own shadow double your size of feeling the breeze getting clutched in your hand. Deliberating on details relaxes your brain and relieves you. I could have written a narrative essay of how you can achieve this trait but I would just like to link  this beautiful piece of writing from Bijaya Biswal. What makes a person boring?  Learning: Relationships end; everyone knows that. The tough part is actually dealing with suffering, accepting, letting go, moving on, and processing a whole lot of other feelings at the same time. The best -ing however not mentioned here is the 'learn-ing'.ook back what were the mistakes you made and what thing went wrong and what just skipped the robe of your control. Learning from mistakes is the best thing one can do.Practicing acceptance: Commit each morning to fully accepting what is happening in the now. Believe there is a reason why this is all happening and trust that it’s for the best.Embracing positive thoughts: Start each day thinking something positive, something that inspires you. Fill your mind with positive thoughts to counteract the negative onesReading: Read self-help books or articles related with this topic. Stop watching romantic movies and listening to love songs. Instead, read, read, read! Books can transform your life.And remember that there is something glorious in you. Be the change you want to see. There's only one person responsible for your happiness, you.Don't be pessimist and stare at the footprints of the person who walk through your heart instead serve greatness by forgiving and forgetting the same person.And just remind yourself that, ""Pain is inevitable but suffering is optional."""
when travelling to a new region is it better to immerse yourself in 1 nonascii 2 cities or to see as many cities as you can cram in	what are the ways to explore world without spending more money	0	Please take your time and do only one city at per 7 days. Paris alone takes weeks to discover. When you take your time, you really get to experience the city like the French do- and you will meet and talk to locals, too. I’ve been to Paris 3 times, and I still haven’t seen all the sights.Wouldn’t it be nice to just go for a stroll in the Latin Quarter, and have no agenda, but just explore?Wouldn’t it be nice to take two mornings to see the Louvre- and enjoy a beautiful picnic in the park afterwards?Don’t forget Versailles takes a whole day to visit. Get there before 9 am and you’ll beat the crowds and be the only ones in the room. You can pretend you are royalty until about 11am- then it’s too crowded and time to go explore the gardens.The smaller museums are less crowded and you have more time to enjoy the exhibits. La Maison Victor Hugo and other period homes are so interesting and full of history.Enjoy Le Musee D’Orsay and have lunch there too! Don’t rush it.Montmartre is so pretty, you’ll want to spend a whole day there.Explore the parks and bridges (each one has an amazing history)- walk along the Seine, take a Bateau-Mouche at night for a romantic trip.Explore Le Marais and do as many walking tours (with your own map) as possible.I find that when you try to cram too much in, you don’t really have time to enjoy it, learn about a new culture and make memories. Take the time to get to know the people at the hotel, the conscierge, the waiters. Those will be the highlights of your trip.When you rush through a trip, you come back with photos, but few memories.

if there will be a war between india and pakistan who will win	who will win if a war starts between india and pakistan	1	India without a doubt.Lets compare.Military:Active Personal ( India ): total 3200000Pakistan : 1100000Tanks:India: 6000Pakistan: 4500Fighter jets:India: 600Pakistan: 400Navy:India: 260Pakistan: 197Nukes:Pakistan: 130–150India: 100–120Nuclear weight:Pakistan: 5000 kton - 10MtonIndia: 10000 kton - 1 MtonNuclear MissilesPakistan: 70km-9500km+India: 150km-10000kmAllies:Pakistan; China ( confirmed), Iran( Confirmed ), Turkey ( confirmed), Saudia Arabia ( Almost), France ( Almost), the rest Islamic states ( with too much expectations)India ; USA ( Almost ), Israel ( Confirmed) , Japan ( Almost)Explanation:India is gonna lose a war with pakistan due to the following reasons.India doesnt have ammunition for a long war, key concerns in CAG report explainedless ammunation.Their fighter jets include Su 30, Rafale, Migs , F 16 out of which 250–300 migs were to retire in 2001 but are still in service . India only has 250 Su 30 which are able to fight in the field.while Pakistan has 250 self made jf-17 4th gen fighters and 70–80 F-16s all of which are enough to comeback india. Furthermore, Pakistan is highly advanced in case of nuclear warheads so pakistan yield much more damage to India in case of a nuclear war. Also if you take a look at history despite of less military Pakistan was successful in obtaining half of Kashmir in 1947, was successful in defence against india in 1965, killed 4000 men destroyed 114 jets and 600 tanks , In kargil Pakistan killed 7500 soldiers with loss of 105. If we consider Russia as an allie of India we should keep in mind that China, Pakistan and Russia have developed strong bonds in the past 3–4 years. Pakistan also does joint military exercises with Russia.Another thing is the military inteligence which is ISI in Pak which stands the best in the world and the special services group which is SSG in pak standing 5th in the world and Indian MARCOS standing 8th in the world.Lastly, Pakistan has one thing which india lacks and will always lack. We call it Brain. Mark my words Intelligence is always better then agression.	In case of India & Pakistan, the All-Out War means limited warfare as both states pose nuclear weapons. Once the war breaks out, From the Gulf of Oman to Malaca straits, the entire trade & Oil transportation to major economic like China, Japan, Korea, Singapore, Australia will be stopped.The Winner of the war would be India, but the consequences will be catastrophic..Aftermath - INDIAIndia may lose some populous cities like Mumbai (3 Cr), Bangalore (1.5 Cr) , Surat ( 70 Lakh), Karnavati ( Ahmedabad) ( 90 Lakh) , Jaipur, Chandigarh with Pakistani Nuclear Strikes as unavailability of Protection cover like S-400 BMD system which could change the entire dimension of the war.Huge Lose to Indian Economy especially in Entertainment Industry, IT Industry, Financial sector & Agricultural sector as well.Massive Humanitarian disaster leads to Casaulites of 10 crore of Indian population & 20–30 Crore will get affected with the Nuclear warfare.The Bollywood Film Industry, Maratha Film Industry, Gujarat Film Industry, Kannada Film Industry will suffer an Huge setback with the demise of Many celebrities.Around Half of the Indian Population will be affected directly & Indirectly by Pakistani Nuclear Weapon if The war Happens Today.# This Aftermath is possible if India doesn't pose S-400 BMD. As India is deploying S-400 batteries by 2023, it will make Pakistani Nuke vulnerable to strike on Indian Mainland.Aftermath - PAKISTANWith One Nuclear Strike on India, India will retaliate with a Punitive & Massive Nuclear Traid Narrative.India could launch Ballistic missiles like Agni, Prithivi from Land based platforms, Nukes from Mirage-2000H fighter & SLBM from INS ARIHANT to wipe out Pakistan from the rest of the world.Pakistan will lose It’s entire Punjab, Sindh, NWFT & Half of the Baluchistan region leaving casualties of over 18 Crore.As a result, You will See ‘NO MORE PAKISTAN ON GOOGLE EARTH’ on the next day.Thank you…

how much funds should i raise	how much money should i raise	1	I think it's interesting that only VCs and entrepreneurs jumped into this conversation. As a professional who has worked at several startups, I have a slightly different perspective.The good professionals who work at startups - the people you want to be at your startup - have goals that don't line up exactly with the founders' or investors' goals. Like the investors but perhaps unlike the founders, they need a huge exit (or a good salary), because their small ownership stakes (<0.1% for middle management, 1% for a vp) aren't going to be life-changing otherwise. Like the founders, but perhaps not like the investors, they need the intrinsic feeling of doing something good for the world (not just making other people comfortably well off). Unlike either founders or investors, they need professional growth, and this is perhaps the most important thing for a startup employee - and the main reason why you need to raise more money than you think. A resource starved environment that's just scraping by can't provide any of that, least of all professional growth.So, before you've proved the model, sure, bootstrap like mad, raise as little as possible, run on fumes, overwork everyone, etc. This is especially true for software startups where salaries are the primary expense, and not equipment, and where a couple of co-founders salaries represent a large portion of total expenses. But as soon as you find the market, if you want to attract and retain the best team, don't starve the business. Raise at least what you need to ensure you can attract and retain the best people.PS - Some examples: Twitter, Groupon, Evernote, EventBrite, Zynga, and FourSquare recently raised money have followed this path of finding the model, raising money, and stepping on the gas. And you can see it by looking at their jobs postings and hiring. And I've witnessed firsthand companies lose top talent from being resource starved, but I'll refrain from making examples of them here.

how does concentric contractions differ from eccentric contractions	how do concentric and eccentric contraction compare and contrast	1	Concentric contractions shorten the muscle.E.g. Curling a weight up with your arm (the biceps are shortening)E.g. Performing a squat (from squatted to standing position; the quadriceps are shortening)Eccentric contractions lengthen the muscle.E.g. Lowering your arm after the curl (the biceps are elongating)E.g. Performing a squat (from standing to squatted position; the quadriceps are elongating)Concentric contractions allow force to be applied to a weight by pulling on the bone the muscle is attached to (by shortening), while eccentric contractions control the reduction of that force by relaxing and elongating the muscle.

why did the puppet they used for yoda in episode i suck so bad	why do people not question news posts and opinions posted on social media websites	0	The puppet wasn’t inferior. It is actually a more ‘realistic’ puppet, and it was of course puppeted by the same performer (Frank Oz).The problem was that they couldn’t get it to look like the original Yoda and/or they chose to make it look a little different to show Yoda’s age difference (which makes no sense…it would be the equivalent of de-aging an 80-year-old human to make them look 77). It is possible that the puppet was a last-minute change when they realised they couldn’t do the digital version. The Nemoidian characters were planned to be CG with a similar body shape to the battle droids, but were changed to ‘men in rubber masks’ to either cut costs or make shooting easier. The Geonosians in Episode II are based on the original Nemoidian designs (notice that the Geonosians look a lot like the battle droids they created). The same might have happened with Yoda.The visual effects guys wanted to do Yoda digitally, but couldn’t get it to work. In The Phantom Menace they were able to get Jar Jar, Watto, etc. looking great because they were new characters, whereas recreating Yoda digitally would have needed to be much better to convince the audience they were watching a character they have seen many times before. It would be interesting to see the early Yoda CG attempts.It sounds like Lucas wasn’t happy with the digital version of Yoda until late in production of Attack of the Clones. In the making of documentary you can see how much work went into creating the digital Yoda. It’s quite an interesting documentary. They also talk about it on the DVD commentary.The digital version is definitely an improvement in the tweaked edition of The Phantom Menace, and it’s weird that they did such a poor job of recreating the original character for the puppet, especially considering how loved the character is.	More accurately, people do not question “news,” posts, and opinions on social media and via other outlets as long as the information provided supports their already established opinion. This is a psychological phenomenon known as Confirmation bias.In the modern era we tend to further enable and exacerbate confirmation bias in our lives by “liking” posts that reflect our biases, and “hiding” or “downvoting” things we don’t agree with and the algorithms underpinning the functionality of social media sites conveniently show us MORE of what we liked, and less of what we didn’t like.Over time, if we don’t make a deliberate effort to question sources and endeavor to learn the actual facts of a matter… it is all to easy to become isolated in our own little bubble of self-deception.

what the meaning of this all life	what  are the meaning of life	1	"To those who haven't traveled in an non air-conditioned railway coach (generally referred to as a sleeper coach) in India, I apologize for my choice of metaphor here. To give a bit of a background, more than half the reserved coaches in India are non-AC. They are generally messier, filthier, hotter, more crowded, and generally more of an unpleasant experience than their air conditioned counterparts.Imagine such a journey. You board the train at 8 AM in the morning, settle down, and feel yourself being slowly engulfed with excitement and hopeful anticipation. It is going to be a long trip; 24 hours to be precise. But the prospect of going back to your hometown, or seeing your lover after a long time, or starting a new chapter in a strange city, or any of the multitude of reasons you undertook this voyage, would certainly make up for it. Its almost noon. Things have been smooth for the past 4 hours. The weather's fine, but it is definitely getting hotter. Your coach is only ~50% occupied. You have already finished the book you had purchased earlier, at the onset of the journey. To be fair, it was a disappointment. However, it did help you kill a few hours. But you are no longer in the mood to read more, so you do not take out the second one, letting it sit idly in your backpack, hopefully to be picked up during the return leg.The first big station arrives. A great human wave overwhelms your compartment. In a few minutes, when the commotion subsides, and the train resumes nonchalantly, you realize that there are now more people than seats. A lot of people without the proper reservations have also got in. But being in India, there is nothing much you can do about it. An elderly gentleman comes up to you and asks you to shift a bit to accommodate him. You are well within your rights to refuse, but you don't want to sound rude. So you comply; you adjust. Another 3 hours pass by. The heat has become unbearable. You curse our little, ordinary, yellow star. You notice that another young man has somehow sneaked into your seat. Originally meant to seat 3, it now is carrying 5. There isn't enough room for you to get comfortable. Not fair, you think. After all you planned your travel in advance and paid for the seat. So you take a stand, and politely ask the gentleman to leave. It's 6 PM now. The sun has started to go down. You have become accustomed to the crowd, the crying children, the noisy group of teenagers in the next compartment, and everything else. The guy you had asked to leave earlier comes back, walks up to you, and apologizes. He is a student, who had to suddenly leave for home due to a personal emergency. He says his stop is next. And that he is terribly sorry for the inconvenience he caused you. You feel like an ass. You realize you had been a terrible person. You blurt out your apology too, hoping to make up for your earlier blunder. You offer him half you seat until his journey ends. You start talking. He is a good kid. 30 minutes or so fly by in what felt like a jiffy. You bid adieu but not without adding him on Facebook. You just made a friend. 7 PM and you are gazing our of the window. The cool counter-breeze is a welcome relief after the sun's unsolicited display of strength earlier that day. The scenery is wonderful too. Lush green fields, small lakes and ponds, a tiny creek, a rustic little settlement. You can almost feel the languid rural life calling out to you, a stark contrast against the hectic pace of the city. Is that regret you are feeling?Anyway, back to the present. Some of the scenery is so beautiful, you wish you could stop and admire it for a few moments more. But like Frost's reminiscence of a fateful winter evening passing through the woods, or Wordsworth's vivid memoirs of gazing upon a daffodil field, you know it isn't possible. Everything comes, stays for a while, and then leaves. Nothing is permanent. With that thought, both distressing and comforting, you eat your dinner and go to sleep. You wake up at 6 AM the next morning, mostly infuriated by the commotion in the coach. To your pleasant surprise, you find a cute girl sitting across from your seat. Being shy, you simply take out the second book and start reading. A few minutes later, the lady interrupts you inquiring about the said book. Not a bad investment, you think. One thing leads to another, and you soon find yourself in the midst of a wonderful conversation. You are pleasantly surprised to discover that the two of you work in the same city, belong to the same town, and have overlapping interests in most cases. ""Could this be love?"", you heart asks. ""Let's not get ahead of ourselves."", your brain replies. However, it definitely could be the beginning of something wonderful. You exchange numbers and outline some vague plans to catch up soon.The journey is coming to an end. You feel both relieved and a bit nostalgic. You are where you wanted to be, but in the process you will have to let go of the past 24 hours. That is life. A journey. A series of events, some memorable some not. An emotional roller-coaster of joy, sadness, excitement, disappointment. A constant battle between being a little sympathetic and understanding vs standing your ground. Friendship. Love. An elapsing sequence of scenes, of moments, of memories. All of them fleeting. Permanently. Irrevocably. The final destination for all is the same - irrespective of power, wealth, beauty, ambition. Death is the eventual finality that we all need to embrace and accept. However, it's the ephemeral nanosecond in the cosmic calendar, where you exist, that is all that matters. "	What is the ultimate truth of life? I always question myself, “Is life worth living?” There can be a lot of answers which might make you satisfied, but which still don’t give you a solid answer.
how should i start small business effectively	how should i start a small business in construction	0	I started a real estate business at the age 19 without any of the advice from anyone if I was given the following advice I would have easily avoided tons of hard work and failure. I went on to start 2 other successful startups and now helping a friend make his own. At this moment I work as a consultant. Below are some advice which I learned the hardest way .. there is a small secret in the end of the read..Make sure you are on board - what do I mean with this? What I mean is that, You need to get excited and the idea of business should make you go crazy happy and full of opportunities. You are the face of business people will follow you if you yourself are convicted with this business idea.Hire trustworthy people- this is probably the hardest part of business. If you are growing into a big venture, bring in your friends whom you trust the most and who will be ready to do whatever you say for the business. Such people are very hard to find and most businesses fail at this point forward.Do your research- Now a days real invention are so rare that if someone makes a new invention people look at them like they discovered fire. So a good chance is that someone has already started what you are going to start. The best you can do in this situation is improvise on the idea and make a new product or service. Much better than anyone else.Don't be the man in middle- if you are thinking of working full-time and starting a business then you are in so much trouble. The venture which will take 2 years to build will take 8 years because you are dedicating 40 hours per week to your full-time job. Quit either of the things and focus on one.It takes money to make money- Back in the day when Jesus was alive it took a lot of capital to start your business. But in today's age with a smart phone and internet you can start so many crowdfunding programs that the limit is infinite. Plus you also have access to thousands of venture capitalist who will invest in your idea. Those who tell you that you need to have a lot of money to start your business have probably started their business back in the 60s.Never give up- easier said than done. When I first started my real estate business in Mumbai. I woke up at 4:30am took the train at 5am and went 15km to churchgate(downtown Mumbai) opened my office where I worked alone and from 7am till 3pm cold called everyone on my call list to buy an apartment. Rejections were the maximum amount but those who accepted my cold calls and bought the apartment are the reason why the business ran so well.Remove the negatives- Look business and startup is a very energy draining job. The last thing you want is negative things or people brining you down. If you are really invested in the business then you will start seeing people leave you. Don't worry they will be replaced by much better ones. But it's your job to tune out the negatives.Don't forget to enjoy - have 12 hours/week for yourself. Don't do anything during that time related to business. Focus on other important things like family and me time! You won't get this again once your business takes off.Go to Investopedia - Sharper Insight. Smarter Investing. and Entrepreneur - Start, run and grow your business. to gain some knowledge about financial terms. Make that your vocabulary, you will need it to understand business and talk to businessmen as that's the language of business.Dress professionally- this goes long way because in today's world people view you by the way you dress. OK I understand that you are thinking about that Facebook dude who wore a t-shirt and hoodie. Well this is not the birth of internet and you are not the founder of FB and twitter. In real business which involves extremely smart people, self confidence and charm along with physical appearance plays a key role.Remember you are the leader and influencer don't let anyone take that position from you no matter who it is.Here comes the secret- Most people in this world, 96% will say that they want to start their own business but has it ever occurred to you why only the top 4% make it to the finish line?? Well let me tell you, it's because 96% people will never put the amount of work which the 4% puts in. You need to decide which side of the spectrum you are on.Cheers and happy venturing!!!	"First, I have to ask ""why do you want to start a business in civil construction?"" Saying ""there is no link.."" makes me wonder.How do you know that this is the type of business that you want to start??While I am not saying that every business should only be in a field that you know, it is difficult enough to start a business - it is even more challenging to build it on a new product or service.. For the sake of argument let's say that you have a degree or some related experience. You probably have worked with someone who has some connection to the industry.If you still do not, then this becomes more like asking ""how do I reach the moon?"" when you haven't even built the first rocket.By the time President Kennedy set the ambitious goal in the 1960's there had already been hundreds of rockets launched. It was just a matter of time and building on past successes and lessons.So, here's the thing.. Stephen Shady offers some good basic advice about going into civil construction. I'd recommend taking a closer look at why you think this is where you want to go. Seek out people in your network who may know someone in a related field. Even if your friends or connections do not know a person directly, they will likely help you get closer.Take the time to know them and seek to add value first. https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/make-your-linkedin-success-mantra-value-before-reward-john-chang?trk=prof-postEven if you find it difficult to connect in person, the world is smaller because of technology. LinkedIn is the #1 professional network here. Maybe there's a similar site where you live. Meetup is also excellent for meeting like minds.Most of all, be open to possibilities that you may have not imagined."
how can we acquire a positive morality	what are time deposits are rd and fd types of time deposits	0	Start with a cleanse.Throw out the story of your life if you are not a hero in it. Buy a beautiful, brand new notebook. On the very first crisp, clean, blank page, write out your story. Take an objective look. Is it sad? Is it angry? Are you unlucky? Does it blame everyone else? Are you a victim? Do you have a sense of agency or do things seem to happen to you?On the next page, change something. Own up to something. Be more accountable. Be more powerful. You have a whole notebook to page by page change your portrayal of the story of your life.As the story in your notebook changes, notice the shifts in your real life.Stop bad-mouthing you. Does your inner voice criticize you, put you down? Can you really work on something if your enemy is on the inside? If you are talking to yourself in a way that you would never speak to someone else, shut that shit down.Don’t spend any time with people who are not good for you. Is there anyone in your life constantly putting you down? Anyone you feel is toxic? Is anyone draining your energy? Do you have “frenemies” and can’t explain why? You are fully responsible for the people you surround yourself with.Stop comparing yourself to others. When you tell yourself someone has it better than you, you are never even getting the full picture. Focus on the work you have to do on yourself. Inside. Look inside. Inside is where it’s at. Not outside.Don’t carry things that weigh you down. Are you feeling bitterness, anger, resentment, a drive for revenge? These things are the same as trying to get through a desert carrying poison instead of water. Throw it out. Let it go. Put it down. Forgive.Forever give up on getting anything perfect. Instead, take risks. Do a terrible job and watch what happens. (I’ll just tell you. Ready? Nothing. Nothing happens.) Every day, be absolutely relentless about learning something new.Say no to things you don’t want to do. This will often be met with disapproval. It might result in you losing some of those frenemies we talked about earlier. But, it will open up more time for you to do the things you need to.There. Now that you have more time, more energy and a new perspective, here are some things to add to your life.Nurture the glorious people who love you. Give them two things. Your time, and your full, complete attention.Come into the fact that you’re the boss. Forget about approval, what people will say or the fear of possibly making a mistake. (I’ll just tell you. Ready? You will. You will definitely make a mistake.) What do you really want? What do you really want to do? Be your boss. You are your boss. Own up to it.Make a list of things you are good at. In that same notebook that contains the evolving story of your life, make a list of things you are good at, or a list of things that fill you with pleasure. Do more of those things. They can make you feel competent (I’m a good listener!) or they can make you feel happy (I love walking barefoot in the grass!) Either way, discover, collect, list, repeat.Make a list of things you find challenging. By “challenging” I don’t mean “likely to cause you bodily harm”. I mean things that make you uncomfortable that you know you need to do. Walk up and talk to a stranger. Ask someone out. Speak up. Develop opinions. Check off every single thing on your list. Start small. Start big. Either way, feel proud of all the times you did things you thought you couldn’t do.Learn to accept compliments. One of the great ironies of life is that it feels like criticism has a special, VIP pass right into our soul and compliments are not allowed in until they show ID and then upon inspection are asked to leave immediately. Let them in. Say thank you.Take care of yourself. For me, this means eating better. Working at getting more sleep. Exercising regularly. Making a commitment to getting into shape does wonders for your self-esteem, teaches you about discipline, perseverance, dedication, and facing challenges. So much goodness rolled into a single objective.Practice being a better person. Be kinder and more considerate. Do what you think is right. Every time I am mean, petty, cruel, dishonest, I suffer more than anyone. Other people get to walk away from me. I can’t get away from myself.Realize you have every kind of resource at your fingertips. If I am feeling blue, irritated, anxious, tired, I get help. I go to a yoga class. I read a book. I talk to someone I love. I find solace in the kindness of strangers. I go for a walk and make it a point to appreciate the color of the sky. I notice things around me that are there to support me if I fall.I mean, even my seat cushion can be used as a flotation device.	Time deposits mean the money is deposited for a specific time period or term. Compared to Savings Accounts, the interest rates are more in these accounts. The rates are slightly more for Senior Citizens i.e citizens with age more than 60 years.Term deposits are popular with investors who prefer capital security and a set return as opposed to the fluctuations of, say, the share market.As explained in our article Different Types of Bank Accounts in India These Deposits have two further sub-categories, as follows:Fixed DepositsRecurring DepositsFIXED DEPOSITSMoney is deposited in these accounts for a time span ranging from seven days to ten years, with an interest rate which is fixed on the day of the investment.Money is a deposited in a lump sum or one time.A person can withdraw the money deposited in the fixed deposits by paying a small fine, which is again set by the bank. This is called breaking the FD.A sample FD receipt from our article Overview of Fixed Deposits is shown belowFixed Deposit or FD certificateRECURRING DEPOSITS“Boond boond se sagar banata hai” (little drops of water make an ocean) As per this saying, small but periodic investments can grow to a large sum at maturity. This is the basic investment logic behind recurring deposit schemes.Unlike fixed deposits, in Recurring deposits, banks accept deposits from customers in instalments, at regular intervals. So, suppose if a person has decided upon depositing the money in ten instalments, then the bank will not accept it in eleven or nine.In Recurring Deposits, the time span varies from six months to ten years.The amount of deposits varies and can start from as low as Rs. 50.The interest rate will be approved by the bank, and it will be compounded every quarter (i.e. every three months).

do i exist	do we exist	0	Most theories I’ve heard go like “you know you can’t prove you exist so we don’t exist”. I’m going to attempt to answer this question a bit differently.Try to imagine, and bear with me:All of you live in my world. Every single one of you out there is simply just a projection with a single purpose: to exist in and shape the world that’s been created for the only real, conscious individual: me.I too don’t actually exist in this world. I’m asleep. Each one of you is just complicated NPCs created for the projection of me to live in this seemingly elaborate world.This reality which I’ve created is so intricate that my higher* mind has built stories and personalities for each single one of you in the world. Existence, physics, universe, logic, life, people, emotion, thoughts, events, inventions, media: everything has been invented by the higher me for the only single person who’s actually alive, the person who’s mind has created everything you and I know.The world didn’t exist before I was born. When I gained consciousness, my higher mind began creating everything around me and intricate causes and details for the existence of each, like stories, history, events and everything I could possibly access and believe.If you’ve lost me here, imagine this: it’s the first time I’m seeing food. My mind is confused and I start to try to find out why food has come to exist and works the way it does. My mind slowly starts to grasp the idea of creating reality the way it is as my ability to grasp bigger concepts improves. The definition of food, over the years, changes from basic like “something that comes from my mother” (a primitive explanation) to “something that grows on trees, caused by complex biological processes” (a more elaborate, mature explanation). To explain everything I come in contact with, my higher mind creates history, people, tastes, thoughts, books and everything that I would possibly need to believe that I’m not in a dream and the things I see aren’t inexplicable anomalies.Over the years, my mind matures to create more complex explanations for everything and everything feels more real. Miracles no longer feel like they exist. I further fall into the dream, unawares.I’m in a dream that’s trying to convince me that I’m not in one. Yet, I’m in one that’s trying to kill me and wake me up. My current state of consciousness seems to be caused by conflict and indecisiveness… and the moment my mind decides that it’s finally time to wake up, when my mind finally picks a side, I die. It could happen now. It could happen in hundreds of years. But everything I know and will come to know will be created only by my constantly growing mind.Prove me wrong. I bet each one of you would try to tell me that you’re real, that you can make decisions and shape the world too. But you’re just in my dream. You’re just telling me that to make me believe I actually exist. You’re doing this because my higher mind gave you the power and characteristics to define my world and make it the way it is. Your opinion is nothing more than just another little, insignificant lie created to assure my wretched existence.None of you exist. Each one of you are nothing more than a tiny reason for my world to exist the way it does.—In my answer, the word “higher” means my higher state of consciousness or the mind that created me and this reality. I couldn’t think of a better word to define what I had in mind.Edit: I finally edited out some glaring grammatical errors from the answer.	"Hi, this is my answer to some other question but it fits perfectly for this question as well.I am 22 years old and very young to answer this question. But still I wanna give it a try.First of all finding a purpose of life is like dividing a 'zero' by another 'zero', which is off course meaningless. But to find out that, it is meaningless one should try it first.I will say, ""experience"" is another name for life. But while having experiences, the one who understands that time is infinite and beyond the reach of man, will understand the life.So, why God has sent you here in first place?You have been sent to make world more beautiful and amazing.There are too many things to see, too many things to experience but very little time, so experience them as much as you can.Possibilities are endless. You can do anything. You can become anything. You can change this world.Everyday try something new, learn something new.It is always better to regret by doing it rather than regretting without doing it.Experience is valuable. Experience everything but don't get addicted to anything.Experience will teach you to differentiate between good and bad, right and wrong.Don't be afraid of committing mistakes, because only those will make mistake who will try something different, something new.Take responsibility for your mistakes, try to improve and forgive the mistakes of others.Treat everyone the way you treat yourself. Be as lenient to others as you are to yourself.Respect everyone and most importantly love everyone.Love is very sparse in this world and everyone needs it.Don't hesitate to ask for love as well as don't hesitate to show your love.Life is too short to be shy, dance like there is no tomorrow, sing with all your heart, eat as much as you can, lough loudly and always cry like a baby.Only your body should grow old not your heart.The day you loose innocence, you loose your life.Think about future but don't worry about it.Think about past but don't get lost in it.There will be good days and bad days. Don't boast in good days and don't loose hope in bad days.Don't give all credits to yourself in success, and don't blame others in failure.Keep moving forward, spread happiness and again make this world more beautiful and amazing.Thank you!!!"

should i repeat 2nd year in college or find a new college it  a 5 year course	i study in ashutosh college in kolkata can i study in any other college in india in my 2nd year	0	I’m a 2nd year CSE student. What mistakes should I not commit during my engineering degree so I don't regret it later in my life? Whether it’s related to academics, friends, or any other field?	A Big yes.Surely you can change the college after 1 st year and get admission in other college for 2 nd year of engineering.What u need is to have a good CGPA or percentage in your first year of engineering and a good character certificate.CGPA needed to change the college may vary depending on the college.Almost all private colleges offer this change,but you cannot go to a Government college from a private college.For college change procedure you can enquire at your college office.Best luck.
how is petrol or diesel pumped up in a filling station using a motor without igniting any fire	what happens when you fill a petrol car with diesel what is the solution if such an incident happened	0	For fire we need three things - Fuel, oxygen(air) and heat. The pump used is kept isolated from air, so as to prevent formation of air-fuel mixture. The petrol in pumped in such a way that linear velocity is below 7 m/sec, so as to avoid any electrostatic charges due to friction. Auto-ignition temperature of petrol is 280 C. So any equipment that produces temperature above is not used. And anything that could be source of potential spark is not used ( that is why they tell you to not use mobile phones while filling ).	You accidentally filled your petrol vehicle with diesel, I assume you filled it up to the brim and your car was almost empty prior to that. I'm assuming also that you are of average literacy mechanically and you're seeking a DIY solution.1st on the agenda is to drain all the contaminated fuel out of the fuel tank. Check if your tank has a drain plug underneath and use that to drain( might need to raise the vehicle in this case), if not, you have to check if it's fuel injection or carburated. If fuel injected, locate the fuel pump relay on the fuse box and plug it out. Disconnect the fuel supply line to the fuel rail and extend it to a container suitable for containing fuel.On the fuel pump relay connector, bridge terminals that correspond to terminal 30 and 87 on the relay. Most relays are labeled. You are effectively pumping your contaminated fuel out of the fuel tank. When the fuel runs out, there's about three or so litres left in the tank but don't stress. You can put 5 litres of petrol and drain again.Now change the petrol filter(in-line) if equipped, and connect everything as was. Fill up the tank with the correct fuel. Crank up the car and it should catch after a few tries if not immediately.In case of a carburated vehicle, look for a cheap under car high pressure fuel pump and connect it to the fuel delivery line as close to the tank as possible. Disconnect the supply line to the carburetor/s and extend it to a container. Note that the pressure from a high pressure pump can damage your carbs.Connect the pump to a power source(use crocodile clips at the battery). When tank is empty add 5 litres of the correct fuel and drain again.Go at the carb/s and drain fuel in the reservoir. Most carbs do have drain plugs for that. If you don't find the drain, cycle the accelerator about 20 times to dump the contaminated fuel into the engine. Fully press accelerator and crank engine like you do on a flooded vehicle to vent off the fuel from the engine.Connect everything as it was and fill up the tank with the correct fuel. Crank the vehicle and it'll catch after a few tries.
what job possibilities exist for a bachelors in homeland security	what jobs are available with a bachelor nonascii s degree in homeland security	1	Homeland Security sounds like a degree from a fly by night unaccredited school whose primary goal is to separate rubes from their money.Engineering is an applied science used to solve real world problems and if the degree is from an ABET accredited university its a ticket to solid employment for the rest of your life.	"There are many diverse fields and positions in which a Bachelor's Degree in Sociology will allow the door to open to you. These include the obvious government social worker positions, such as providing case management services to clients within the system, in need of Section 8 housing assistance, welfare or food stamp benefits, or you could assist with government sponsored job-training services and employment rehabilitation counseling,  as well as many other positions within the field of counseling-- if that is something that sparks your interest. You could find work at many prisons, juvenile detention facilities, drug rehabilitation centers or mental health care institutions. You could also find work as a middle, junior or high school guidance counselor, as a residential counselor at a home for troubled teens, or as an emergency services care coordinator for abused women at a shelter, or become involved in foster care administration. The medical industry is a large employer, as many hospitals and other health care centers and providers retain workers with Sociology degrees as Patient Services/Insurance coordinators or Social Service/Health Care liaisons, to make sure that all patients are being treated fairly and receiving all aspects of the proper care available to them. This might entail seeing that patients get insurance approval for necessary tests or medications, assisting with information or paperwork for patients applying for government benefits; it could also include duties such as an intervention of parental custody when the patient is a newborn infant, with positive drug testing results. Funeral homes, large hospitals and hospices are another option for work as a grief counseling specialist. If your interests in sociology work are less suited to the ""social"" aspect of the field, and lie more closely aligned to the research aspect of the field, then you might be happier to seek employment within the medical, scientific and clinical research industry firms employed as a research labratory assistant, institutional research analyst, or a quantitative data coder. You could analyze data or conduct quantative and qualitative research studies, working as a junior project director in market research. You could become an assistant program director at the YMCA. Advertising and public relations firms could value your input as a field researcher or market trend analyst. Political campaigns services coordinator or field researcher is another position suited to  a degree in Sociology. This is just a small sampling of what might be possible with a Bachelor's Degree in this field; it is an unbelievably diverse field with unlimited potential! Good luck to you!"
which are the best books to understand calculus	what are good books to self study calculus	1	There’s a bromide among mathematicians about calculus texts: They are all isomorphic. The term “isomorphic” roughly means that not only do two things have the same - or pretty much indistinguishable - objects (content), but the relations between the objects are the same as well.So if it’s big, thick and says “Calculus” (bummer on that 3rd count girls) - it’s a duck.I’ll cautiously recommend a terrible book on calculus. It’s small and thin: Calculus Made Easy by Silvanus Thompson. It was written way back in 1910 by a Brit who delights in repeating “What one fool can learn, another can.”The big stumbling block(s) in calculus is/are the concepts of “limits” and “continuity”. It’s the rare student that “gets it” the first time around. And I would say that is mostly because it can be made to sound very simple and reasonable by a skilled instructor. Thompson’s introduction to these concepts in about the first 20 pages is not, for my two cents, easy reading and doesn’t help that much. I got through it and most of the rest of the book seemed a breeze. Once he quit blathering about limits “in theory” and actually started using the concepts intuitively on the big problems of calculus (slope and area) - very easy reading.I read it cover to cover and it let me successfully challenge all but the last calculus class while going straight into differential equations. Two full years of math my first quarter. With that stellar start, I went down hard when I tried to move on to advanced calculus. If you want to be a mathematician, that should be a consideration. If you just want to learn the nuts and bolts of calculus with a crude idea of why it all works, Thompson’s book is OK or even fantastic.I’ll add there is one more thing that is critical to success in calculus: Algebra skills. If your ability to manipulate algebraic expressions (accurately) isn’t good to excellent - no calculus book ever written will help you.Good luck!

why and how did you break up with herhim	how and why did you break up with your ex	1	That is an answer for the ages… We've all had good and bad exes, and the appropriate stories of the ups and downs… Sometimes, the method of doing it can lead to friendship whilst other times to hardship.I can share a few stories with you:A girlfriend of 1.5 years: She and I talked due to our lack of communication and my unadulterated love for sports. She told me to pick and I decided for my sport.A girlfriend of 1.5 years: She was receiving messages from another guy and I wouldn't tolerate it… I told her that if he wants to tell her that he loves her, then I'm out of the picture. She gave excuses why it happened. And I didn't care… I drove off but I looked back in the mirror to see her crying… We lasted another 3 months before we mutually ended it.A girlfriend of 2 years: I took her out to a beach side in the evening and sat her down to tell her that it was over due to me falling out of love with her… She climbed out of my car window, started screaming for God to strike her with lightning and for me to run her over with my car… Eventually, people came over and I moved away cause they might have thought I was raping her… The only way to get her home was me accepting for a one month break, where I wanted total radio silence, and I pushed her away even more. I still loved her but the relationship was not going the right way.A girlfriend of 1 year: She never talked about her feelings and I would have to reach down her throat to pull them out. She eventually admitted that she loved me but there were so many things wrong with our relationship and I agreed. Then she proceeded to say that she wants to commit suicide, to which I said it's over. Then she curled in a ball on the floor crying (as she always did to manipulate me) and we had make-up sex but nothing ever changed. She kept wanting to change me, then we broke up for the same reasons via a post-exam meeting, where I told her I was done and she curled in a ball again. Crying and screaming. I was stared at by the whole bar…Relationships are never easy to form… even harder to end…	The fact that i am answering this, and not anonymously, makes me feel a hell lot better.6 amazing years, that is how long it was before this “breakup story” gets made. Increasingly finding her busy in her work, i had gotten into a habit of giving her her space, which she asked more and more of. She worked for an IT firm, sometimes 8 in the morning to 11 till night. Allow me to remind you that this is the same girl who would not sit for an hour straight, even in an ice-cream parlour.We had waded through a rough patch before and i was sure, we were meant to be together. Long term relationships can’t be possessive, or they turn sour. Thankfully, we were past all the muck. We had planned our engagement in December - she was always keen on the “forever after” stuff. I had never been more glad to comply. It was November when it all started. Her father had a heart attack and she started travelling to her hometown, which was a night away from her workplace, almost every other weekend. One time she went home asking me to not call, lest her parents get worried over us. I waited, like anyone would. There were moments when i felt terribly alone but refrained from calling (I had been posted to Gujarat and for the first time in my life was at complete loss of like minded people). It was a fortnight later that i got her call. Her father was better and she was back at her workplace. But our engagement was off for a while.In any healthy relationship, you talk, no matter what. We hadn’t been talking like we used to for a while now,3 months to be exact. In February.finally free from her project, she called me to her city to meet her. And we did meet. Just like we always did - madly in love, laughing our guts out, together. Nothing had changed. I felt so stupid for being paranoid about us.That same evening she had to leave for her hometown owing to her father’s health. As requested, i waited for her call and did not disturb her. I did leave messages though inquiring about her father. It took her a week to return to her workplace and when she did, she bombed me with a lot of previously untouched subjects - like how unsupportive, mean and uncaring i had been to her. This phase continued for over a week. Eventually i realised, this wasn’t her stress speaking. That night i got a call from an unknown girl. There are moments in our lives that we remember so vividly that we can recount them as if they just happened. This phone call was one such moment for me. She refused to tell me her name but every word she said, i remember clear as a crystal.My dearest had been visiting some US based guy in her hometown and their families had agreed upon their marriage. Apparently, money supersedes all. This stranger girl whom i shall never know just gave me the rudest shock of my life and saved me from a greater one. What followed was confrontation - she was someone else entirely, all since that one moment when i asked her if this was true. “Sorry” was all i got, to lead my life on, without the person who i thought was central to my existence. After everything, she wanted me to be a part of her life as the person who knew her best.Now all of us, or say, most of us have this inbuilt mental circuit that calls out the crap. Mine just beeped madly :) I had had enough. That was it.What followed was three months of isolation and a substantial self harm. Different people deal with things differently. That was my way; not proud of it. One thing that this simple girl was adamant about, in our playful banters was a platinum ring with one diamond for her engagement. That brings me to today - saw her facebook page with engagement pics.Well, even she never had it!Few people live their dreams. I just wasn’t so lucky. So what?P.S.: On a lighter note, i bought a KTM Duke and will be riding to Laddakh. God bless her for the breakup. I just got gifted with time, money and freedom while she got a boring nerd for life:D
can i use jio sim in phone 5s	does phone 5s support jio volte	0	You can't generate barcode on iphone 5s and get a jio sim but yes you can use jio sim registered on any other phone in an iphone 5s.Problem is you won’t be able to call by 5s through jio sim because iphone 5s doesn't have VOLTE(voice over LTE) support but it is a LTE phone which means you can use 4g internet on an iphone 5s.Still you can make and receive calls on iphone 5s or any other LTE support phone through jio sim by downloading ‘Jio Chat and Jio4Gvoice app’ only problem in that is you need to constantly keep mobile data network on for receiving calls.	Yes, Absolutely. If you look at the website of the Jio, there is a feature from where you can verify that your phone is 4g or not. Take a look at this screenshot:-You phone is 4G LTE ready. Although to make calls you will need to download the Jio4gVoice[1] app as it is not 4G VoLTE ready. But if you are using Jio you are probably gonna use it for internet(maybe because the plans are very cheap). So go to any shop and start your DIGITAL LIFE!Footnotes[1] Jio4GVoice - Android Apps on Google Play

what are the best songs for low voices	what are some songs for a sweet airy mezzo voice	0	Since I guess you want timeless songs for your range, I would suggest Carpenters entire catalogue and Cass Eliot's re make of dream a little dream of me, originally a hit in 1932, it is still very fresh today. California Dreaming from her work with The Mama's and the Papa's is good too. But most important is what you like and can put something of yourself into. You can easily teach yourself to be fluent in basic music theory with free music software from Google play, and then figure out what fits your skills and range and which songs make your heart sing even before your voice does. Don't, forget to get a pitch monitor while at google so you can know what you are doing , then look on a sheet music site and see if you can do the notes you see in the sample and judge whether it goes too high in the ones they hide.This answer is from: What Are The Best Songs For Low Voices?If you’re trying to really make something out of your voice (whether for fun or to make a living) there’s a difference in learning properly and getting random tips scattered around the internet.That difference is generally friends and family smiling faintly and people actually WANTING to hear you sing.If you haven’t seen it already LearnToSingTV is giving away a full free audio book which will help take your singing from A to Z.

At my country church weddings are viewed as a service at church, so anything performed in the ceremony needs  preferably to have a religious message. It's recommended to have the choice discussed with the church musician who is playing at the ceremony (and usually accompanies). If you have a civil ceremony or if the song performed at the reception, you can pick any love song that fits the voice and the couple likes.For the church ceremony Panis Angelicus by Franck is popular, or any Ave Maria (there are plenty..Schubert, Bach/Gounod, Caccini etc). You can find arrangements in different keys to fit the singer.Knowing the context in the original opera, I wouldn't pick ""Mon coeur"" aria that was suggested in another answer for a wedding. Dalila is evil character. (Admitted that most listeners will not have this association though)."
can anyone predict my birth chart	what can you tell me regarding this birth chart	0	This question has been asked on Quora multiple times and I have also answered similar other questions before. Hence today instead of writing the same steps of analyzing one’s career, I will give an example which will help you understand predicting the career of the person using the birth chart alone :-Chart 1 :-Always, Start with the 10th house and see if there is a planet in the 10th House. Since in this case there is no planet in the 10th house we will just check the ruler of the 10th house and move to the next step. 10th house ruler in this case is Mars.Check where is mars sitting in the chart and what are the influences wherever Mars is sitting.Mars is sitting in the third house of courage, efforts, communication. So, the profession may have something to do with these things. Since Mars also represents sports we can also keep that as a possibility. Finally Since mars is a malefic we must always keep technical profession in Mind. Next check what are the planets influencing the house.In this case Ketu is sitting with mars, so it will have the maximum influence. Ketu represents mathematical abilities and also research. You can also try and understand how Jupiter and Rahu will influence the career, I am leaving that to the readers.So, till now we have sports, communication related profession or a technical profession with some form of research involved.Next check the sign in which Mars is placed and recollect what does it signify. You will find in the charts of sports person that the sign of virgo is significant so this person can actually be in sports. One other important signification of Virgo is Analytics which is technical and since the person in this field is working on data and drawing inferences it has research associated with it. So, we still have the dilemma Sports or analytics.Here the fact that the person is a cancer ascendant can give you a clue that he/she may not be physically that strong to be in sports. Though please do not take this as a generic statement. Presence of mars in the ascendant can make someone very athletic even if the native is cancer ascendant.Also, Mars itself is not so strong in this chart as it is on the rahu ketu axis and in the sign of its enemy Mercury. So we can think that sports as a career seems unlikely. But we will verify that in the next step.Check where Mars is placed in the Navamsa- In the case of this native mars is in the sign of Virgo, hence analytics is still a possibility. On the other hand let us say mars had moved into the Navamsa of Aries then sports would have again come into the picture. Because that would have made mars stronger for sports related activities.we can move onto the Dasamsa and further verify our conclusion but here the analysis done so far is sufficient to understand the career possibilities.Note##- Please do not think that virgo only represents - sports and analytics it represents many other things; but since I cannot run you through to all the possibilities I gave the significations of virgo which are related to this chart.Also, if you remember I also mentioned that the third house also represents communication, so this native actually has to make presentations based on the findings and present it to the client. He is a Data scientist and works extensively on data modeling. Here if we could have found the education first and then went on to career our job would have been much easier. In some other post I would do that as well. This person has a Masters degree in Statistics.Example 2 :-10th House has a planet in this case, so we could straight away ask the native - Has your profession got something to do with Management.Next observation - Jupiter is ruling the 8th house. So probably a lot of research is involved in his daily activities. ** Having 8th lord in the 10th is not always bad. If a person has 8th lord in the 10th that can indicate a career in research related fields. And yes, in other cases it can also indicate troubles during early years in the career or rise after someone else’s downfall etc….because the list is endless.Moving on the sign placed in the 10th house is that of Saturn and that too aquarius hence we can infer that the person is involved in some technical job.Saturn has gone into the 2nd house in the sign of Gemini(Communication) alongwith Mars (Technical planet-Engineering). So , my prediction for this person was are you into a technical job which involves some degree of research and management. I was unable to understand what how exactly second house is influencing his profession. I did not check navamsa etc. for profession in this case as I could sense the profession is technical. He said he is into manufacturing RAMs.Let us do some reverse engineering - RAM is used to store information. What is second house - It is the house of resources, apart from other things like eyes, wealth, family, food etc. So, Can we say that RAM is used to store resources ( Second house) for future use. But can someone ever predict a career where someone is manufacturing RAMs - Let me be honest , I cannot do that.It is always easy to backtrack and learn things but since there are so many professions available these days it is next to impossible to totally pin point the exact profession. Let us say in this case if the person had venus in the second house, then we could have said - Do you own restaurant or are you in the catering business or working as a cook?So, basically this is how you predict profession of an individual. I will present more examples if needed. Knowingly I presented examples where the profession was difficult to predict; In most of the cases it is not so difficult.Now, if you are learning astrology, What you should do to identify profession of an individual, Learn the significations of the following ;-HousesPlanetsSigns.Yes, basics. If you can understand these three things you can very easily identify few professions which the individual might be involved in, and then based on the background and education of the person you can arrive at the exact profession or at least be able to tell the nature of work the individual might be doing.In case you have any specific profession which you want to analyse then please leave that in the comment section and I will try to tell the houses, signs and planets which will be involved in those cases. Also, If you want me to present charts where I failed to pinpoint the prediction I will be happy to do that. In those cases I missed the dasha that the individual was running as they play an extremely important role.Hope this helps!	"Each of us have things we're supposed to learn in our lives. But as you've requested, I won't lecture on positivity and living rather on the reasons behnd where you are at this moment in time while not ignoring the pain you've experienced in your life to this point.As I stated in my comments because those invariably are part of the whole picture, what I was able to determine from the chart you initially posted, I knew you must have been born around October 26/27, 1986 depending on the nation where you were born. Your vocabulary made me suspect you were from India, which explains to me why I expected you were born in the early morning hours there.I knew at once that you were in the midst of your Saturn Return although what's known as the perfected conjunction (0°) has passed now. On the other hand, the coming year will be equally important as you have the opportunity to wade through your own issues. Now here's where I said in my initial comments above, ""many people fall into a deep depression during this period especially when they have had challenges in their lives that somehow directly impacted self-esteem.""By transit, you've been taking a beating, I know: Pluto has been transiting your 4th house of the home while Uranus has been in your house of marriage and other long-term relationships. But while you have a Libra rising that would tend to make many people relationship-oriented, I get the sense that your need for relationships is more about yourself, that you would rather people just let you be instead of trying to give you their expectations of you. Your natal Venus is retrograde, which makes you very cautious and reserved. You're not only a Scorpio Sun, but you have Pluto conjunct the Sun. You would rather--as you always have--be able to get across to people that you don't need or want their pressure because you're still going to march to your own beat anyway. You're extremely private and independent, and the only thing that will occasionally make you come out of your shell is when you're speaking with friends often in frustrated anger. I'm guessing the closest friends are--or even just one friend is--likely to be female who would understand this need to be yourself, the need for your own self-expression rather than what everyone else tells you to do. I have absolutely no doubt that your self-esteem through the years has taken an especially rough toll on you: It's rough enough to have Venus retrograde in Scorpio in your second house, but here's also where you have Mercury in Scorpio and Saturn in Sagittarius (although Saturn will be considered technically in the 3rd house of every day happenings). Now your Mars-Pluto square isn't all there is. In fact, your Mars (actually in the 5th house) is in opposition to the 11th house Moon in Leo. This duo forms a fixed T-square to the arm--Sun-Pluto conjunction. Your Sun is clearly in the 1st house while Pluto is in the 2nd because of its proximity to the 2nd house. As a result, that arm points to both who you are, the first impressions you give and the self-image even that you have developed as a result of what's going on with your 2nd house. I find this chart quite fascinating since your Jupiter is also forming what's called a 20-minute partile conjunction to your 6th house cusp and is therefore considered in your 6th house. It's also squaring your natal Saturn, a highly significant point since this now ties in to your Saturn Return as well as what I call The Peeling of Life's Onion: the transiting aspects of Saturn in Sagittarius in square to Neptune in Pisces (preparing to conjunct your natal Jupiter from now through 2018). The good news is the Saturn-Neptune ""Peeling of Life's Onion"" hard aspect will be over by December 2016. I didn't ask you where you live now even though I had later thought of looking at your Solar Return and the progressions. But what's here makes me believe that your family may be pressuring you into marriage despite that you're probably more likely to want to avoid that journey altogether. You're too independent and really would be likely to prefer to make your own choices whether or not anyone else understands. From what I see here, these feelings seem to be extremely intense and enough to make you dig your heels in with every effort to manipulate your decisions in others' directions. For what it's worth, I'm so sorry to see all of this. It seems like they will stop pressuring you to fall in step with them after your next birthday, and that will most likely be in lne with when Saturn moves out of hard aspect to Neptune in December. It seems like the pressure amounts to your love probably for (I'm taking a stab here) your mother and how you'd really prefer not to disappoint her; but your life is truly your own and you wish others would get this.I thought about what you asked--""I want to die soon. I can't live on this wretched planet anymore. Why did I have to suffer so much in my life? How much struggle is still left? When will I be set free from this forced existence?""--and I will tell you two things about this: First, the chart lives on after we're gone so it's not that easy to look at the chart and say, ""Yes! Here it is!"" And frankly, anyone who tells you that really is not being fair because they're influencing your free will when this may actually not be the right time for you to leave. (I also know you're aware of karmic law here.) Secondly, my own code of ethics which I believe is in alignment with many other astrologers in the world prevents me from seeing the chart with that request about when you will leave this lifetime in mind. It's directly related to your chart living on after death. It is your journey. It's also your responsibility to live your life. Does that mean you have to give in to the demands of others to do things they may insist on when it's your life? No. But you have a responsibility to yourself, your life. The biggest thing you have in your favor is time. I'll ask for nothing more than your granting time permission to work in your favor for a change. It will."
when was the birth of the trigonometric functions	who were the creators of trigonometry	0	Various theorems proved below include but are not limited to:AM-GM InequalityPythagorean TheoremThere are infinitely many primes.

The sine of an angle is half the length of the chord of twice the angle.So, if Ptolemy wasn't the creator of trig, who was?Hipparchus (190–120) preceded Ptolemy by two and a half centuries, and was mentioned by Ptolemy. He produced the first trigonometric table for use in astronomy, but it wasn't as detailed as Ptolemy's.  It was also a table of chords for angles in a circle of large fixed radius, but he didn't use degrees. His table was much coarser and used “steps”, each step being 1/24 of a circle.  (So a step was 7.5°.)  That's not a very long table having only a dozen entries.Hipparchus was an astronomer, and it may be that he was the first one to use a table of trig functions.

The guy you are dating really likes it so you say you love pizza to make him like you.You don't like pizza and end up eating pizza often rather than speaking up.You risk ending up angry at him for always picking pizza. Your anger builds up. You can't see it now but you are not angry at him. You are angry at yourself. This is people pleasing.Now imagine you don't like pizza and all your friends like it. You say you don't like pizza, but you like spending time with them so decide that you can be flexible, that this time you can set your preferences aside to be accommodating.That's being nice.I understand how this can be a fine line but the first will make you feel used and resentful and diminished and the second will make you happy because you own where you stand and are being generous.People pleasing is not about making things easier for others but rather involves compromising who you are. It means trying to make everyone happy at your expense and realizing that despite your effort it cannot be done.It's a losing battle to play against yourself. It's sacrificing you to such an extent you lose track of who you are. That's not nice. Nice begins by being nice to yourself.
what do countries do to prevent war	how should countries prevent war	1	Countries do two very important things. They become more open. The build relationships among rest of the countries in the world and try to be part of one world. They do it through trade, partnerships and through human relationships, arts etc.They have to govern their countries well and satisfy their people's aspirationsThey strengthen their internal defense. Their intention is that their internal and external forces don't threaten their governments.Being a responsible member of United Nations that works well to ensure peace in the world.The above don't ensure that they can successfully prevent war. If relationships between countries are not strong, it could lead to war. They should have open trade. Trade is opposed to war. So, all countries should trade and interact with other countries well.There is no need to stress about the importance of good governance. When the leaders of the country don't govern well, people in the countries may revolt. While it is important for countries to strengthen their internal defense, it is not good if the military strength becomes too strong. Because some eccentric leaders may decide to misuse it. Which is why we need the fourth point - A strong United nations with responsible members will be capable of ensuring peace in the world. It requires some reforms in the United nations.This is something I believe: We need a strong country like US to be the police of the world. Without it some dictators will torment their people or unnecessarily wage war against other countries. Of course, the global policeman should have some kind of a control. Presently the citizens of USA can keep a check on their leaders. But it is not most effective. What is required is some reforms in UN so that there is good democracy in it.

Presently the citizens of USA can keep a check on their leaders. But it is not most effective. What is required is some reforms in UN so that there is good democracy in it.

why should i learn web design	how can i learn about web design	0	"The answer to this question heavily depends on your background and your learning goals. Specifically,Are you brand new to programming, have dabbled a bit in programming, or are you currently a programmer in a different field?Are you learning for fun or hobby, or are you looking to break into software development as a career, within a time frame of, say, 6-12 months?Let's break it down:If you're a current practicing programmer and want to learn web development for fun and expand your horizon, I'd recommend the following:Consider learning a new language that's very different from your current working language. For example, if you're a C programmer, learn a high level, dynamic language such as Ruby; If you're android developer using Java, check out a functional language such as Clojure or Erlang/Elixir. Those languages will open your mind and help you grow as a developer. Go find books or courses that are written by developers for developers, for example, Zed Shaw's ""Learn Code the Hard Way"" series is pretty good; Pragmatic Bookshelf and No Starch Press also have books for experienced developers. Do some code exercises or take on a simple project to practice with the new language (For example, Dave Thomas writes a Markdown parser whenever he learns a new language). You should be productive with the language in a few days.Find project-based courses that take you along to build apps, oftentimes with a framework. Once you learn the language, you can probably get to frameworks quickly, and troubleshoot as you go with Google or Stack Overflow. As an experienced developer you probably constantly get distracted by new tech, therefore being able to quickly put things together will keep you motivated and entertained, so you can keep going.If you're a current practicing programmer who wants to transition into web development professionallyIf you have software development experience in other fields, when you look for jobs the expectation is typically that you will be able to quickly ramp up and contribute, and can work as an intermediate level web developer. To prepare to meet this expectation, your learning focus shouldn't be ""fun"" and ""personal growth"" focused like the first scenario, but to aim to have a thorough understanding of the web stack and the current best practices of a development stack.If possible, pick a language that's closer to your current working language, and one with lots of job opportunities. As of this writing, I'd consider Java, JavaScript, Ruby and Python. If you already program in one of these languages, stick with that and learn it really well. I don't find lots of online courses that teach languages beyond the beginner level, so I'd suggest that you pick up a ""canonical book"" of your language of choice. (see a list below)Learn the foundations of web development concepts: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, HTTP and databases. This is an important step - don't jump into frameworks right away. This is the foundation that all web development practices are based on, so if you have good understanding of these topics, getting into the higher level abstractions of frameworks is going to be much easier, and you'll find that you have a lot less to memorize, because you understand the core web machinery. (see a list of learning resources below)If you want to become a professional web developer, you have to have a solid understanding in the fundamentals. Udacity has a great course that covers this level you should check out: Web Development Online Course .Learn the leading stack in your language of choice (Grails, Node/Express/Angular/React, Ruby on Rails, Django) and study the abstractions. As an experienced developer, employers will expect you to be not just a user of frameworks, but can have deeper conceptual understanding and can bend them to your own will. Don't stay on the surface, it's important to understand how frameworks map ..."	I’m currently working on Flash and ActionScript 3.0. Next semester, I’ll be taking more Flash and HTML classes. What are the best steps to learn web design? In what order should I learn programs and coding? What comes after Javascript?
how will indian gdp be affected from banning 500 and 1000 rupees notes	what will be the implications of banning 500 and 1000 rupees currency notes on indian economy	1	Q. How will the ban on 500₹ and 1000₹ impact Indian economy?There are already a lot of great answers for this question. I would like to keep it short and precise:-Pros:-Many black money holders will be under radar: People who have black money are mostly in pithole. Either they have to go to banks to exchange their money into new forms of notes and get under the government radar. Else they forget the money because it will turn into useless paper soon.The West Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee is so worried. She tweeted and asked to “withdraw this draconian decision”. Obviously she should be worried. Her party MLAs have acquired lots of black money from Sarada Chit Fund issue.Current 500 and 1000 rupee notes can only be exchanged at banks. The exchange can be carried out by providing valid proofs like Adhar Card, PAN card or voting card. Bank will keep record of each details, so it will check whether the money is black money or not.Nullifying fake currency notes: As of April 29, 2016 fake notes worth Rs. 16.50 Lakh crore has been circulating in the country. Recent studies have suggested that fake notes of Rs. 70 crore are infused into the system every year and law enforcement are able to curb only one third of them. 90% of fake notes are released in bigger notes like 500 and 1000. So this step will nullify all the fake notes.Decrease inflation: If I have black money or I have fake notes, I can even pay Rs. 600 for an item costing Rs. 500. This is because, this money is not my hard earned money and I have enough fake money. When a person purchase an item by giving extra money, this increases the cost of the money. Hence inflation increases. With this step, black money and fake notes will be nullified. Hence it will impose a check on price inflation.National security will increase: A huge amount of black money is used in funding terrorism which is direct threat to the national security. This step will curb black money. Arms smuggling, terrorist activities, etc will be reduced. Hence activities like 26/11 or Uri attack will be reduced a lot due to lack of funding for terrorism. This will stop funding to Kashmiri separatists. This will also reduce the “pelting of stones” by Kashmiri kids and youths who are asked to throw stones for Rs. 100.Reduce crime carried out by underworld: The black money and fake currencies are used by underworld and mafia too. From abduction to killing contract to a sharp shooter, black money is used to fund crime too.Reduction in activities of Land mafia and real estate corruption: Black money are used by lot of people in real estate business. This hikes the price of real estate. This step would be beneficial in controlling inflation in property related transactions. Also, real estate sector would get institutionalized. When housing price would go down, this will force the demand of reviving the sluggish housing segment.Reduction of inflation will be overall: Inflation are always overall. So reduction of inflation will be overall too including Higher studies and medical treatments.Cashless transaction will be encouraged: The new limits on ATM withdrawals has been restricted to Rs 2,000 per day. Bank withdrawals have been limited to Rs 10,000 per day and Rs 20,000 per week. hence it will increase cashless transaction like online payment and card payments. Countries with more cashless transaction face very less fake note threats because most transactions are digitized. Since more transactions are digitized, they need less printed currency and low quality paper for currency notes. That’s why US dollars are of low and thinner paper quality and Indian rupee are better and thick paper quality comparatively. US spends less in printing currency notes than India.Since cashless transaction will be encouraged, it will reduce the use of printed currency and hence reduce the use of fake notes.Since cashless transactions are digitized, government will be able to keep track records.Less use of currency note means less cost in printing currency notes.Cons:-People will rush to ATMs and Banks to exchange 500 and 1000 rupee notes. People will try to withdraw as much money in 100 rupee notes from ATMs. Even to withdraw Rs. 2000, they will transact for 5 times withdrawing Rs. 400 each time to avoid Rs. 500. That what happened on 9th November night after the declaration.Many people, especially from the rural India, aren’t aware of the total fact. Suddenly they will realize that the 500 rupee note they are carrying is useless. If the village panchayat or administration could help them, then they might understand the scenario fully.Extra cost to replace all the existing 500 and 1000 rupee notes: Printing new notes needs money. Declaring old notes as invalid and putting new notes into system will cost a good amount. The details are discussed in this link. Scrapping Rs500, Rs1000 notes a costly ideaPeople with low working class will be slightly affected: Generally people like plumber, maids, manual scavengers, electricians don’t have huge amount of 500 or 1000 rupee note. They only convert them to bigger notes when they have to carry out transaction in large sums and those are rare. Other than that, they get money after the end of month and that in 500s. These people aren’t aware with procedures of bank, mostly. Moreover, it’s not easy for them to not go to their job and spend times by standing on queues in banks.India is not fully ready for cashless transaction: Regions like rural India, North East India, township areas, sub urban areas, etc aren’t modified enough to go for total cashless transactions. Many normal people of metropolitan cities too, are not fully computer literate and they are not fully accustomed with internet, or payTM, etc. Basically, a huge number of people are not accustomed with cashless transactions.Ineffective for black money stored in other forms: Corrupt politicians like Jayalalitha don’t store black money as liquid cash. She converts them into gold. People like Amitabh Bacchan keep black money as foreign currencies in foreign banks. This decision can’t force them to surrender black money.Opposition will misguide people to take political advantage: Due to short period of notice, many people aren’t aware of how to exchange the 500 and 1000 rupee note. Many people don’t even know that Hospitals, Air ticket booking counters, petrol pumps are accepting 500 and 1000 rupee note for 72 hours till 11th November. They will be easily misguided by other political parties for the upcoming UP election. On 9th November, I saw some interviews of common people taken by various news media. Some people appreciated the decision. Some were criticizing it with abusive words. A guy said- “I have 500 and 1000 rupee note. I need to purchase petrol but Petrol Pump isn’t accepting it”. An old man standing beside him said- “Government had said that petrol pumps and hospitals have been asked to accept 500 & 1000 rupee note till Nov 11”. The other guys started objecting by shouting so much that the old man couldn’t even complete his sentence. He was pushed back by them who were criticizing the decision. Basically these guys stopped the man from sharing some information and clearing people’s doubt.Some points to know:Government has given time from 10th Nov to 30th Dec to exchange 500 & 1000 rupee notes.Till 11th Nov, petrol pumps, hospitals, air ticket counters will accept 500 & 1000 rupee notes.No confirmation from RBI that new 2000 rupee notes has nano GPS chips.Conclusion:Earlier, many people were worried about black money and wanted GoI to take step to curb it. Now GoI has taken a serious step and some people are creating issue out of it for temporary difficulties that will prevail only for a week. RBI doesn’t give a damn to two days’ minor difficulties when a long term beneficial decision is to be made for stabilizing the economy of the nation.Instead of being impatient for two days’ inevitable difficulties, we should support this for the better economy of the nation.Jai Hind.I was asked to answer by User-12096777814958329195. Thanks to him.	I think it’s important to understand some basics about black money before judging this giant decision by the government.When we hear ‘Black money’ what most of us imagine is this:And conclude that this is ‘evil’ or ‘bad’ and hence must be cleaned up. And that is all there is to ‘Black money’.The truth is this hoard of cash might be completely legitimate, even if it hidden under a bed - if it has been disclosed to the government and taxes have been paid for it. Then it is white moneyMoney = Cash?I might store all my money(black or white) in bank deposits, or in the form of cash at home - if that makes me happy. I might use it for charitable purposes or to throw a booze party or for a lavish wedding. That’s my right.Money can take the form of cash, real estate, gold or whatever.The only question which makes it black or white is: Have the requisite taxes been paid?If taxes are not paid, then it becomes black money. Now I need to hide this money. Surely bank deposits are not a good idea! If I buy something using this money I need to hide that too. So I buy big things in somebody else’s name(benami transactions), stash it in offshore accounts(which promise secrecy), invest in real estate(by showing lesser value) etc.Note that the cash component is a small part of the total money - especially If I have huge amounts of black money. It is simply impractical to hoard it all in cash.So ‘money’ is NOT the same as CashSo when we say our stated aim is ‘To curb black money’ we are not just hunting for hoards of cash. We are not even hunting for people with lots of real estate, or politicians who have a lot of gold. People can legitimately hold on to all that.We are hunting for hoards of cash, or people with lots of real estate, or politicians who have a lot of gold - who have not paid the taxes on it. And then collect those taxes. And perhaps impose heave penalties to prevent recurrence.But even this catches existing black money. The real solution is to make everybody pay taxes. But maybe catching existing black cash is also a good first step…So let’s analyse how useful this step is.Coming to demonetisation, two things to understand:It directly affects only the cash component of money. Not the real estate, gold etc. that I have. And that too, the part that is in form of 500 or 1000 notes.It affects black and white cash. You and me had white money but still were forced to deposit it in banks.So to judge effectiveness of the demonetisation scheme, we should try to calculate how much of the money is in CASH, and is black, and will be collected - and compare it against the total black money.A - Domestic black money“As Schneider estimates, using the dynamic multiple-indicators multiple-causes method and by currency demand method, that the size of India's black money economy is between 23 and 26%”Source: Indian black money - WikipediaLet us assume it is 25%“The Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in India was worth 2073.54 billion US dollars in 2015”Source: India GDPThis translates to 141 Lakh crores. 25% of this is about 35 Lakh crores.B - Offshore black money“In March 2012, the government of India clarified in its parliament that the CBI director's statement on $500 billion of illegal money[in foreign tax havens] was an estimate based on a statement made to India's Supreme Court in July 2011” Source: Indian black money - WikipediaThis translates to about 34 Lakh croresTotal black money = A + B = 35 + 34 = 69 Lakh croresThe question now is: How much of this black money is in cash and circulating inside India in form of 500 and 1000 Rs notes, which the demonetisation scheme might recover?C - Total currency in 500 and 1000 Rs. notes = 14 Lakh crores“the annual report of Reserve Bank of India (RBI) of 31 March 2016 stated that total bank notes in circulation valued to ₹16.42 lakh crore (US$240 billion) of which nearly 86% (around ₹14.18 lakh cror...
why does understanding death philosophical	what makes understanding death philosophical	1	When our hunting-gathering ancestors started cooking food, thus having more time and energy to develop their brain’s frontal lobe, they started to “simulate the future,” asking, what if this and, what if that?The drawback was that it created a metaphysical angst. Who made the earthquake and the thunder? Where do we come from and where will we end up?To overcome it, he created stories. Thor’s hammer, a creation and an eternal after-life. But what is philosophy? For Socrates it was: never stop asking questions. As such, anyone writing a book about philosophy … has stopped being one! ;-)In one of his book, Stephen Hawking tells the story that, during one conference about black holes, a woman stood up saying: “That is not true! The earth rests on one gigantic frog!” Mr. Hawking then asked: “And on what does the frog rest on?” She said: “On an infinite pile of frogs!”Then Mr. Hawking goes on writing a book about black holes, and so on. At the end of the book he writes: “Of course, I can’t prove anything of this, no more than the lady with the frogs!”… wise words from a wise man. What is the philosophy of death? For my sake, it is Nietzsche’s Eternal Recurrence … but I am open to any other idea! ;-)	When our hunting-gathering ancestors started cooking food, thus having more time and energy to develop their brain’s frontal lobe, they started to “simulate the future,” asking, what if this and, what if that?The drawback was that it created a metaphysical angst.

why are dogs considered omnivores	are dogs carnivorous animals	1	Because people are ignorant - no scientist, nutritionist, or biologist would say that.Carnivore means that an animals nutrients are provided mostly by animal sources - whether through predation or scavenging. It does not mean that they are obligate carnivores (cannot survive without meat in the diet) and it does not mean that they never eat plants. It means that as near as we can tell looking at wild counterparts diets (wolves), dentition, etc they are 100% carnivores.Dogs do have a gene that wolves do not have which allows for better absorption of nutrients from starchy plants (potatoes, rice, etc). However, this does not alter their classification as a carnivore.This is a deer - a classic herbivore. It is eating meat:This is a cat, an obligate carnivore that will die if not fed meat. It is eating a plant:This is a dog, it is a carnivore. It is eating pizza:Just because an animal can eat something does not reclassify them as a carnivore/omnivore/herbivore. You look at the behavior or the animals in the wild about what makes up the majority of their diet. Wild wolves, coyotes, etc, somes eat feces, insects, and wild fruits, but the vast majority of their nutritional needs are met by meat. You can buy your dog a “vegan kibble” and if it has the right and properly digestible nutrients the dog can survive, but that doesn’t make it a soy-a-vore.

what it is like to be cheated upon in a relationship	what is it like to be in a relationship with someone you cheated with	0	June, 2016:By this time, we had completed two years of our togetherness and were cruising very well for a future together. One sudden day, a guy drops to see her, the same guy chosen by her parents to be her future partner.Displeased by this suddenness, she showed anger towards her parents for not informing her in advance and taking things forward without her consent. When asked, she told me that her mother has asked her to meet him as a friend and then they will deny their offer.She met him, he was a pretty rich banker who was wealthy and showed up to be a good guy in front of her. Their numbers got exchanged and then began the cheating part.She showed disinterest after meeting him, told bad things about him and said that her parents are forcing her but she is strong. They started chatting over texts, he was already floored down by her beauty and she seemed to have not liked that guy at all. By this time, I had appeared in my SBI Mains and was waiting for my results.I cleared SBI Mains and was waiting for my interview dates. I went to Bhopal for my interview, came out of the room and called her since it went pretty well. I was hopeful of a selection and wanted to meet her since she was in the town.35 missed calls, 30 messages, 3 hours of wait and I left Bhopal with sadness wrapped over my face.Couple of days later, she revealed that she is getting married with the same guy. She told me that she was pressurized by her family to do so and was swear in by her grandparents for this guy. I believed in her story, she kept on blabbering all the stories and I kept believing. She told that she will break the alliance very soon, would reveal everything and I was kept hanging for few more days.More drama, verbal abuse and some well-crooked stories in coming days.Then came the twist.One fine day, I happened to visit her best friend’s bank for some personal work where she was employed and had no idea about our relationship at all. During conversation, it drifted towards my girlfriend and then she showed me something which swept away the floor beneath me, I still feel those nervy cramps in my body and a rush of anger and despondency crept in all over my face.She showed me a part of it, rest I took it on my own to know the truth. They had a WhatsApp group of three female friends and she was very happy about the marriage. In fact, she was taking a lot of interest in first night rituals, asking for suggestions on her apparels and fascinating about the gala wedding that was going to happen.That day, I found out that whatever she told me was a pure lie. Their meeting was arranged after informing her in advance, her parents had met the guy and she had given her green signal to meet him. If this was not enough, she showed extreme interest in that guy and when she revealed things to me, it had already been a month.The day I was informed about her decision to marry him, tickets, garden and everything was booked and I was foolishly swindled by her. Well, if that was not the end of it, she had spoken negatively about me in front of her friend and termed me as a guy who asked her out and she denied the offer at the outset.So, what it is like to be cheated upon in a relationship?Brutal, extremely brutal. The faith, the trust, the hopes, you lay down everything in a single person for two years and it just fades away in a moment. You feel screwed up from top to bottom, lose the whole of your self-respect and confidence and the question of “Why” keep troubling you day in day out.You feel devoid of energy, you lose all the trust and your eyes see suspicion in every act of people around you. To make things worse, if you never knew it coming, the reality hits you very hard and it becomes tough to cope up with the severity of it.Well, in the end, if you put all your trust into a single person, you either get the best person of your life or you learn a lesson.I got the latter one.RegardsA Nomadic BankerEdit: We share the same organization, the guy and me both.	Yes. Semi-long term. 6 years. Married for 4. Separated at 3. Tried again for a year to no avail. I left, ran away with my first love, flew back to get a bag for Europe and then once more to sign the divorce papers. It was very peaceful. I cried more than he did. I knew I was going to miss my friend. A lot. He was with his new wife within four months. They're happily married (I think). My boyfriend and I are still happily together. It's been almost three yeas. Things worked out best for all parties. It happens. Don't let people tell you it doesn't.
how do i know if someone blocked my texts	if i turn of my user id off can i text someone that blocked me	0	There is only one sure fire way to know if someone has blocked your number. If you have repeatedly sent texts and got no response then call the number. If your calls goes straight to voicemail then it probably means your number has been added to their “auto reject” list. That means your text messages will never come through to their phone and your calls go straight to voice mail. I’ve been forced to do this myself to obnoxious ex-girlfriends.However they can also be one of these losers that say “I just don’t have time to respond to texts” and those words are always spoken by lazy, disrespectful losers. If a persons life is SO busy that they don’t have 15–30 seconds to respond to a text then they don’t have time to wipe their butt after using the bathroom and if they don’t have time to wipe their butt then you definitely don’t want to hang out with them.	"Nope, unless you're talking about WhatsApp or some other such service. If you're talking about straight up SMS then no, you can't. ""You"" are tied to the phone number you are using. If course you could if you got a different phone number... but that would be going towards creepy. Personally, I wouldn't waste my time texting someone who blocked me; I'd simply move on with my life.Cheers!"
what are the most interesting foods you have eaten in any country	what is the most delicious dish you have  ever eaten and why	1	The best food I have eaten is a very specific type of Idly called Mallige Idly. By this sentence most Indians will know that I am a south Indian. Anyway, almost a month back, there was a war going on twitter. Gordon Ramsay v/s South Indians. Just because he said our every day food which is Idly and vada looked like prison food for him.. Frankly speaking, it hurt me.. Because I am no prisoner and the food I eat is in fact so healthy that many hospitals serve them on a daily basis to its patients and many doctors recommend this to be consumed on a daily basis as it causes zero affect on health. But, I am least bothered as I know what Idly is made of and how tasty it is and he is the one who is at loss as he will never be able to taste what we taste.Moving on let me describe how this became my favorite food.. As long as i remember, my mom used to make terrible Idlies.. They were full of rava and i hated it (sorry mom). So I could hardly eat idly. But, it was twice a week mandatory breakfast at our place.. we had to eat it as breakfast and then take it to school for lunch.. But, at school i would eat other’s lunch to satisfy my taste buds..I am from Mysore, so the famous festival Dasara gives us a lot of opportunity to have variety of food.. There will be fair and exhibits of lot of stuff which can be bought and also lot of tasty food.. Its called “Mysuru Dasara exhibition”.We used to go there every year as there will be lot of games to play for children (which I wanted to to back then). When I was 9 or 10 years old we were walking in the exhibition, looking around for something exciting to eat with my mom and my brother.. My mom saw that there is a stall of “Mysore Mallige Idly”. So she took us there. She ordered 2 plates of Mallige Idly. One for her and me and one more for my elder brother.. As I used to waste a lot of food back then, she wanted me to taste it first..Maillige idly usually will be served with 2 or 3 types of chutney as shown in the below photo.But, the size and shape of the mallige idly was not like the one in the photo. Just to give you a rough idea.. Have a look at the below picture which shows the thickness of a idly.But, a mallige idly will be 1.5 times thicker that the one in the picture. A lot softer, in fact it will be so soft few people call it sponge idly.. literally it will be like a sponge if to try squeezing it.. but it will not be chewey at all.. it will just melt in the mouth..So, continuing the story. My mom smeared some red chutney and some green chutney and a broken piece of Mallige idly and gave it to me for tasting.. Just for me to decide, if I wanted it or not.. I just put it in my mouth and the flavours of red chilly, ginger, garlic, coconut, coriander, curry leaves, Roasted gram (Hurigadale), with occasional encounter of muster seeds, along with all these the the soft soft mallige idly started bursting in my mouth.. It just melted like butter in my mouth.. I felt like i just visited heaven..I had never tasted anything like that before.. So, i ended up eating 3 or 4 plates of mallige idly that day.. My mom had to call it a day and drag me out of that place..Since then, my mom kept trying and trying to make those idlies. But, till date she hasn’t been successful.. But, the idly of hers has improved a lot.. now i like my mom’s idlies..But, after that, over the period of several years, I have tried Mallige idlies at several places none of them were like the one that i ate that day.. I used to hunt for Mallige idlies in and around mysore but, dint find anything even close to that.. One of my uncle said there is one place near pandavapura (Mandya district) where, in a small house one old man prepares mini idlies which tastes similar to mallige idly.. Immediately I told my dad (he is my partner for all kinds of food exploration, we always keep each other updated on “New good places to eat in Mysore” he is a big time foodie) that we should go there.. so the next day morning we left mysore by 6 am rode on a two wheeler for almost 40 kms (approx) for few plates of Idly.. But, trust me it was worth it.. we enjoyed the journey and the food was amazing (Not a mallige idly. But, fantastic idlies) I would have eaten 3 -4 plates there too..So there it is the best food ever eaten..P.S: I am still searching on the Dasara Exhibitions every year to find that perfect mallige idly. So far I have not been successful.. Anyone knows any place in Bangalore or Mysore which serves awesome mallige idly.. Please let me know.. A hungry soul is waiting to be satisfied.

what is it like to be a private banker	what is like to be a private banker in switzerland	0	What is an investment banker? How can one become an investment banker? What different degrees do you study to be one? If you do something like...	"I was born into wealth and never knew our family was different until acclimating to the public school system and developing cognizant thought. My father was recruited by MIT and came to the United States speaking only two languages: Japanese and binary. Upon graduation, he was quickly snatched up by Japanese financial institutions that sent him abroad to set up their computing systems. This was back in the day before IT was segmented, and he was a one man operation (architect, network administrator, systems engineer, programmer, IT support and R&D LOL.)Before moving abroad for good, he married my mother in Tokyo and together they immigrated to Canada. I was born in West Vancouver, British Columbia and attended exclusive private schools. My classmates were of the same socio-economic status as my family, so our lifestyles were similar. Our days were jam packed with lessons, classes, tutors and we were privileged to take weekend trips to Banff or Lake Louise. When I was in the 1st grade, my family migrated south to the U.S. - the San Francisco Bay Area to be exact. Against my mother's wishes, my father made the executive decision to put me in public school. I was still in 1st grade but clearly remember the moments I started realizing the kids at my new school were unlike my old peers. I was the only one dressed in pinafores. The only one taking a load of after school classes and lessons. Other people didn't go away on weekends. My home was different. Everything about my family was strange, and I remember thinking I was not just the new kid, but the weird new kid.In order to fit in, I started lying. I would tell people I lived in San Mateo as opposed to Hillsborough. I stopped inviting people over, never told friends about our weekend trips. Or that I attended summer school at Crystal Springs Uplands, then summer sports camp at Stanford University. Being constantly exposed to two different socio-economic worlds, I didn't fit in anywhere and was an outcast.Separately, gross behavior from people who think they have more than the next person is more commonly observed in new money. My family is proof.My father's family has a prominent lineage that can be traced for centuries; I guess it's called old money. My father was the only one who lived outside of Japan and my brother and I would spend our summer/winter vacations with our grandparents. My day school friends and their families were exactly like my father's side: kind, well mannered, polite, gracious and classy from the inside out. You see, when born into wealth, there is nothing to prove. We are raised to assimilate and not stand out as much as possible. Yes, we do own nice things, but there is no need to flaunt. Growing up in the U.S. and Canada in a household that only spoke Japanese was embarrassing. Public outings with my father could be turned into a sitcom. He spoke broken English even after living in English speaking countries for 20+ years. I used to be mortified in public with him. His voice was loud. His English poor. Yet no matter how atrocious his grammar, pronunciation and vocabulary, he still talked to everyone in a pleasant manner. Everyone. At restaurants he frequented, from the valets, wait staff to busboys and the kitchen, the entire staff knew my father. The chefs would take my brother and me to the kitchen for special menus. (These were 5 star dining rooms.) When we drove through Half Moon Bay, my father would stop by his favorite farms and greet farmers working the fields. They only spoke Spanish and he spoke zero Spanish but somehow they were able to communicate. At his work, from security and maintenance staff to his assistants, colleagues and C-level execs,  people would smile and wave hello as he walked by. He took after my grandmother, who treated every single person the same: like they mattered.Conversely, my mother grew up dirt poor. Frankly, she was a gold digger and married my father for stature, status, lifestyle and most importantly his wealth. She epitomized gross new money characteristics where she felt entitled because our family was more privileged than most. She was snooty, elitist and condescending to those she thought were beneath her; absolutely charming to those who were of equal or higher social statuses. Even as a child, I remember apologizing for her vile behavior and was embarrassed to be in public with her. Long story short, even if we had access to things a lot of people didn't, it still wasn't enough for my mother. On the outside, she was polished, elegant, sharp, witty and sustained her youthful looks. But she was a horrible wife, mother and housewife. She was miserable most of her adult life; making everyone around her even more miserable. I'm making her sound like a crappy person, but as an individual she was phenomenal. I - along with many - admired her. She was a born entrepreneur, extremely brilliant, creative but analytical, methodical, strategic and organized. When my parents finally divorced, she left my brother and me with our dad and succeeded career wise. So much so, she retired in her early 40s. After she attained what she thought was success, she was diagnosed with Stage IV cancer. She spent the days up until her death regretting almost all the choices she made and beat herself up day after day. One of her last journal entries included reflections on how unappreciative she was with the things in front of her, and finally realizing happiness does not lie within superficial matters a little too late.Looking back, I am extremely grateful for my parents and my life. Don't get me wrong, my life was far from cakewalk but I obtained invaluable life lessons. My father, taught me my favorite quote: ""A true measure of a man is how he treats someone who can do him no good."" by actions, not words. My mother, taught me money cannot buy happiness. I am so fortunate to comprehend those simple yet complicated life lessons I still abide by. And just by remembering those two points, saved me from making vast mistakes in relationship, career and life choices. So what does it feel like to be rich? It's like everyone's life, no matter what your financial situation is, there are ups and downs. Different ups and downs, but ups and downs nonetheless. Hope this sheds some perspective. Oh. As for my father, the divorce (and my mother) basically destroyed him, and a series of events led to my father being disowned. I have not spoken to him since I was 16... along with other misc. family drama. But that is a story for another day."
what is journalism for you	what is journalism	0	Is this by any chance an essay question? The “for you” addition is quite important. Clearly, audiences and users consume and interact with content for many different purposes and on an increasing variety of media platforms. For example, mobile devices are becoming very significant. They are replacing /have replaced the TV in many parts of the world as the number one way we get news and entertainment.However, when people talk about “journalism’ they often have a unitary definition in mind. That is to say, they think of the classic ‘public service’ journalism model represented by well known names such as Woodward and Bernstein - ‘All The Presidents Men’. This type of investigative reporting that may appear in quality broadsheet national newspapers is viewed as classic journalism for many people…Exposing the rich and powerful for the scum-bags they (sometimes) truly are!But what about consumer magazine journalism or gossip websites? These outlets may place a greater emphasis on entertainment rather than education. Such articles may be created simply for profit, but represent journalism in so far as article may obey traditional conventions on writing style, accuracy, contain interviews and show a degree of research by the journalist.In quick summary, academics increasingly refer not to journalism, but there being many ‘journalisms’. Content that includes some elements of journalism e.g. a YouTube video may qualify.	Billionaires own government and have outlawed journalism. The only legitimate governing authority imposed on anyone is that performed by governing entities under the strict, 24/7/365, dictatorial [DEMOCRATIC!!!] command of our citizen majority [primarily by/for the local majority]. The moment our citizen majority loses even the slightest portion of instant command over our governing entities we're no longer CITIZENS: we disgracefully surrender to FASCIST RULE and become SUBJECTS. The portion of power the Constitution places under our citizen's majority command is actually nil. Genuine DEMOCRATIC RULE would ordain a constitution that forces government funding of ELECTED citizen groups who'd, in turn, force government's abject obedience and defense of every citizen's rights under The Bill of Rights [especially JOURNALISM= FREE PRESS]. That democratic constitution would force the elected citizen JOURNALISM groups to publish/distribute/broadcast a complete transparent account of all governing. The true function of an actual FREE PRESS [JOURNALISM] is to consistently punish those who passionately seek to rob us of our life as CITIZENS and who'd joyfully profit from forcing us into the disgraceful nightmare of living as powerless SUBJECTS under fascist rule. In other words, it's the job of actual JOURNALISM to heroically punish/restrict capitalism so severely that the poorest of us command governing power exactly equal to that of the richest. The actual purpose of our malicious, fascist, founding fathers had for writing the Constitution of the United States was to destroy/prohibit democracy. Absent democratic funding of a genuine FREE PRESS [JOURNALISM] we'll continue to live as disgraced, powerless subjects enslaved and impoverished by the fascist billionaires who've totally outlawed journalism [excluding the minimal dissemination provided by a few heroes on the net= TYT, Jimmy Dore, Lee Camp, RT, Thom Hartman, Amy Goodman, others].

what are the pros and cons of the german shepherd dog	what are the pros and cons of having a pet german shepherd	1	Pros:Exceptionally loving, loyal, easy to train, and care about your feelings. I used to leave food on the table and go out for hours: my German Shepherd mix would guard it instead of eating it.Sensitive, sweet, kind and playful. At one point I had a kitten and my dog was completely besotted with him. They would roll around on the floor together for hours. The kitten would pounce on his tail and playfully claw and bite his face, and the shepherd would just snuggle up and lick him.Intelligence. They are rated by Stanley Coren as one of the top ten breeds in terms of working intelligence. From my own experience, I'd describe them as highly trainable rather than smart exactly. Very beautiful and athletic, especially the working lines. Instinctively protective and usually sensible about it. I felt safe walking alone at night with my shepherd mix, even in rough neighborhoods. The only times he showed any aggression to humans were when he sensed that I felt threatened -- in which case he could be extremely intimidating. None of my other dogs have shown such good judgement.Cons: They're somewhat nervous: because they are also loyal and protective, they need substantial socialization to ensure they won't endanger people and animals. This may be a major time sink. Some shepherds will never be trustworthy with small dogs, which means you can never let them off-leash in a public place. I knew a well-bred shepherd owned by very experienced, responsible people, who bit a stranger in her territory severely.They bark about the average amount for a dog, which is too much for many people, so you will have to train them to bark less. They also shed and stink about the average amount.Some people are really scared of them. You may have difficulty getting a lease.They are usually Velcro dogs. They don't want to be alone, and when they're awake, they really want to participate in whatever you're doing. If you have to go out a lot, or you don't want tennis balls dropped in your lap while you're watching TV every night, or you like to shower alone, don't get a shepherd.They are fairly active dogs, both mentally and physically. Just to not be miserable, they need about an hour of exercise every day, toys to chew on, and big open spaces to explore. Young dogs are too big and rough to be around young kids without frequent intervention.They have been through periods of popularity in which unscrupulous breeders produced lines with unreliable temperaments. In addition, some responsible breeders select for much more tough guard dogs, whilst others aim for a softer, more gentle animal. So finding the right breeder will be challenging. They are very prone to a wide range of health problems, more so than similar but less popular breeds. Be prepared to shell out money for hip surgery. For this reason alone, I would choose a first generation cross if possible rather than a purebred shepherd. Or you might consider a Belgian shepherd, which are very similar but have less problems.Most of these cons can't be predicted or controlled for any individual dog. There are ways to deal with them, but they're costly. German shepherds very often end up in shelters because their owners either didn't think through, or found they couldn't deal with these issues when they actually happened. This is heartbreaking for everyone involved, and most of all for the dog. You might consider adopting an older dog since shelters usually screen them carefully and will know which issues are likely to arise.

how much cgpa i require to get an admission for mtech cse at iit madras	can i get a job in a consulting firm after mtech in cse from iit	0	I don't think it's worth doing Mtech from other than IIT or IISC Bangalore in my opinion.So for general category gate score must be above 550 for getting admission in IIT. Must be greater than 600 for IIT Kanpur and IIT Bombay.As for as CGPA is concerned it must be above 6 for IIT Bombay, above 5.5 for kanpur, and above 7 in Delhi . So if it CGPA is above 7 u r eligible for all IIT .	Yes, definitely. Infact all the consulting firms give top priority to CSE students. Basically a consulting job has nothing to with Engineering. Once while interacting with a IIT Bombay graduate experienced I'm consulting jobs, told me that consulting job destroys your engineering.

From ASAP Science's (link in citations) video on lacrimation.The reason that we cry, or lacrimate, is still open for debate. Theories range from crying serving as a non-verbal cue to it being part of some kind of hormone release valve mechanism.There could have been social evolutionary benefits for those who cried. Crying could have served as a signal for help or pity, or a bonding tool by which the crier is consoled and a bond is formed through that consolation. Note that these would be advantages to have in societies where the proficiency of a group's communication is key to their proliferation as a whole (e.g. a primate society like ours).Another theory to explain crying is that crying is the body's response to too much stress. This theory could possibly explain the different chemical composition of tears developed during crying, as opposed to the tears that are created for natural lubrication or in response to irritation. This theory speculates using both the aforementioned differential composition as well as the ""relief"" that is felt after a cry. The premise of this theory is that ""tearing"" up is the body's way of getting rid of the hormones that developed during stress. Tears, in this way, would be a product of our body's means of decreasing excess hormone levels.I don't know how this would account for the tears developed when happy, however. Perhaps happy tears evolved for a similar purpose to the aforementioned social advantages.It is thus likely that lacrimating evolved for multiple purposes.Citations:image and a great video from ASAP science about it - general - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryinghttp://www.npr.org/templates/sto...http://www.livescience.com/7854-..."	"What happens when you cry, exactly? A salty fluid chock full of protein,water ,mucus and oil is released from the lacrimal gland in the upper, outer region of your eye. This fluid, better known as tears, then flows down the surface of your eye, across your face and smears your mascara.Of course, not all tears are of the emotional variety. In fact, three types of tears exist, all with different purposes. Basal tears are omnipresent in our eyes. These constant tears are what keep our eyes from drying out completely. The human body produces an average of 5 to 10 ounces of basal tears each day. They drain through the nasal cavity, which is the reason so many of us develop runny noses after a good sobfest.The second type is reflex tears, which serve to protect the human eye from harsh irritants such as smoke, onions or even a very strong, dusty wind. To accomplish this feat, the sensory nerves in your cornea communicate this irritation to your brain stem, which in turn sends hormones to the glands in the eyelids. These hormones cause the eyes to produce tears, effectively ridding them of the irritating substance.The third type of tears is emotional tears. It all starts in the cerebrum where sadness is registered. The endocrine system is then triggered to release hormones to the ocular area, which then causes tears to form. Emotional tears are common among people who see Bambi's mother die or who suffer personal losses.The phrase ""having a good cry"" suggests that crying can actually make you feel physically and emotionally better, which many people believe. Some scientists agree with this theory, asserting that chemicals build up in the body during times of elevated stress. These researchers believe that emotional crying is the body's way of ridding itself of these toxins and waste products.In fact, one study collected both reflex tears and emotional tears (after peeling an onion and watching a sad movie, respectively). When scientists analyzed the content of the tears, they found each type was very different. Reflex tears are generally found to be about 98 percent water, whereas several chemicals are commonly present in emotional tears .First is a protein called prolactin, which is also known to control breast milk production. Adrenocorticotropic hormones are also common and indicate high stress levels. The other chemical found in emotional tears is leucine-enkephalin, an endorphin that reduces pain and works to improve mood."
what are 5 facts about the earth  crust	how does the earth  core affect its crust	0	1. The Earth's crust is the outer most layer of the earth and exposed to atmosphere and that's why its the coldest layer.2. This is thinnest of all layers. It ranges from 20-30 km in oceans to 70-80 km at mountains.3. The earth's crust is sub divided into the large parts technically called plates and these plates are supposed to be floating over asthenosphere (upper part of semi-solid Mantle)4. Oceanic crust is dencer than that of continental crust.5. The earth's crust is less than 1% by masss and volume of entire earth.6. The crust has the most complicatedand variation in its composition. The most abundant element in crust is Oxygen by weight and by volume.7. The normal earth crust's geothermal gradient is 2-3 degrre centigrade per 100 m and pressure gradient is 0.3 KB/km8. Due to availibilty carbon, oxygen, hydrogen, water and other life forming element, life exist only on earth's crust.9. Crust is the home for all type of landscapes.Source: Google image, USGS, Wikipedia, Igneous and Metamorphic petrology by JD.

what would be the best way to quit smoking	how did you quitstop smoking	1	"Rather than give you the usual opinions and political diatribes, why don't we start with what I learned from researching the tobacco industry and what they know?Myth #1: Smoking is stupid and gives you nothing. You were suckered into it and now you are a big fool who is stuck with it.Myth #2: Nicotine addiction is worse than heroin.There are probably a few more myths but these are the ones that matter most because they lead you to believe that you were crazy and now trapped. It also separates the physical aspect of smoking from the mental side and explains why you need to fight the habit on two separate fronts - and not necessary at the same time. The reason most people fail to quit is because they do exactly that - they fight the mental and physical side of smoking at the same time, and it is virtually impossible to succeed. Napoleon couldn't fight Britain and Russia at the same time nor could Hitler, so take wisdom here!Granted, you will always hear stories from people who say they did just that - thereby making you look like a chump and them remarkably superior. In most cases, they weren't truly committed smokers: part-timers who really smoked to be cool. Committed smokers are engaged in a form of existential self-medication. So, if you are smoking a pack or more a day and especially, if you started on or before age 18 - listen up, this is about you, the committed smoker whose identity and life-coping skills are now deeply entwined with smoking.Answer to Myth #1: Smoking is stupid and gives you nothing.Smoking may be terrible for your physical health but it has recognized benefits for your mental health.Depressives are 3 times more likely to smoke than non-depressives. Smoking has long been used as a folk-cure for anxiety, ADD, plain boredom and so on. Nicotine has been shown to address early stage Alzheimer's, and smokers tend to be attracted to other smokers, especially those that share their brands - like fellow tribesmen. So it is also very social - especially for young people.The fact is, you smoke for a reason - or a bunch of reasons and you need to deal with them. You don't have to resolve them, most run really deep but, at the very least, you need to find a strategy to deal with theses issues which may include transferring them to some other activity, preferably sports, yoga or some other physically fulfilling pursuit. Even a little overeatin' is better than smokin'….. easier to lose weight than fix a diseased lung, as they say!Sadly, however, most people transfer to prescription drugs (watched any TV commercials lately? drugs dominate the media) but in that regard they are far from alone. According to the Centers for Disease Control, prescription drug rates have increased as a mirror image to the decline in smoking. That's right folks, 30 years ago when about 44% of the adult population smoked and 24% took stuff like Valium, Xanax, Ambien, Ridalin, Concerta (or their precursors) now only 24% of the adult population smokes and about 46% are chomping down those drugs. (Let's not forget the quit-smoking Chantix on that list, which is essentially an anti-depressant.)In other words, while no one was looking, Big Pharma took over from Big Tobacco. In fact, if you go back in time to TV 1966, you would be amazed by the number of cigarette adds. Then flip to today's primetime TV and you will see they have been replaced by prescription drug ads.If you are literate enough to read my book, Cigarette Seduction, and willing to dip into your cigarette money account to buy a copy - you will see how your brand choices reflect your underlying mental condition (we developed this from smoker surveys and a semiotic analysis of brands). You can use this to analyze your reason for smoking, the triggers and even develop strategies to transfer mentally.In other words, what you smoke is how you quit……Myth #2: Nicotine addiction is as hard to quit as heroin.Having interviewed heroin addicts, I really have to laugh at this. When you listen to former heroin addicts, they talk about their habit as if they went to paradise, met God, had lunch with Jesus and ravished all the virgins in heaven. I know of no cigarette brand that has this power. The fact is, you can quit nicotine over a bad cold. You just need about 3 days for it to leave your body - enough so your nicotine receptors can stop going crazy. If, however, you are foolish enough try to resolving the mental, self-medicating side at the same time as the physical cessation, it may certainly feel as bad as heroin (at least in your mind's eye) but I can guarantee you it's not the same. Not even close.Bottom line: take the time to understand your personal relationship with smoking, get a handle on the motivation and the triggers. You should buy a book to help you along (I mentioned one….). There's no giant rush here. I spent 4 years doing this before taking the leap and quitting for good! It also helps if you start debranding and even moving to a different delivery platform such as mini-cigars, tobacco chews (Skoal Bandits, snuff etc.) or best of all, eCigarettes.Then, when you are comfortable, and in control, you catch a really bad cold, a touch of flu' or, you just take the leap, say at a nature weekend and quit. Then, just stay away from other smokers (who will always subconsciously try to ""draw"" you back in), your usual haunts and so on, as you say good goodbye and good riddance to smoking. You start chewing baby carrots, make more love (but without the smoky ending), run, jump, play tennis, swim or otherwise keep physically busy…..and you'll get there.Most important - once you demystify smoking and replace it strategically, you will never feel the pull to smoke again. At that point it, makes no sense - smoking will seem as big a joke as ""heaven"" is to an ex-heroin addict."	How do I stop smoking weed if I’ve been smoking every day for the last three years? I don’t think I can make it through the day without smoking.
which is the best programming language for tcs	which is the best programming language	0	I think i can answer for this question.Me n my friends had attended the interview in TCS. There is no need of any indepth knowledge about programming language.Just you want to know about the basic stuff of any programming language(Arrays,Objects,var,parameters,arguments etc..).They will ask about small programs like printing patterns,Fibonacci series n all.You just only need concept of the program.Prepare for language that will use in your future also like Java,Javascript,C++,python.Note: They will don’t care if you have any programming language like android or any related language.So Prepare for java with full of basics from variable to arrays to type conversions.This will definitely help to getting into job.Happy Reading….	Everyone writes about C++ and Java or even C. The question was what is the best language to start learning NOW in 2014 not 1994.C++ is widely used because it's absolutely general purpose. But writing in it takes time... But seriously, a lot of it. Same for CJava right now is used mostly for android and enterprise software. However the latter slowly moves to other languages. Why? Because Java is horribly redundant and boilerplated. If not android it'd be dying language.Python is good, but it's not so new or innovative. Whilst if You want to learn something from scratch You'd want something that yields great productivity and top technologies.But now what is really good language to start learning.The most useful right now is - unfortunately - JavaScript. Why? Because You can write anything in it. From websites through desktop apps (node-webkit, TideSDK), mobile apps (Cordova PhoneGap) ending on web servers and even realtime app servers (Node.js)It's extremely useful if You want to write little apps that don't require type checking and more advanced structuring.What's next? Ruby. Why? Because it's most popular language on github and stack overflow right now. Community is the most important part of any environment. What's more Ruby has been created with easiness of development and fast iteration in mind. Thanks to that You can ship Your product the fastest.But what if You want to write huge servers that are typesafe and have no performance overhead? Scala. Why? Ask LinkedIn for example. They moved their whole infrastructure into Scala and they say it has been the best move they could make.Although Scala has very steep learning curve it's worth the commitment. Martin Odersky the creator of Scala has been working on Generics system in early Java dev and he claims it's so broken he had to write language from scratch. What's more Scala uses Functional paradigm which is becoming widely popular because Amdahl's law started to matter much more than Moore's law in today's CPU architecture.PS. Even Quora uses ScalaIf You want to learn language that is popular now. OK pick C++ or Java. But if You want to learn something that will give You advantage over people with 20 year inertia. Pick one of the above/Edit other language that is worth taking look at is Go but I don't know much about it so I won't take a voice./Edit2 For iOS dev Swift is the one too/Edit3 For scalable distributed systems with nine nines of availability there's also Elixir. It's pretty new (3 years now) but it's really worth looking at. It's a maturity of Erlang with productivity of Ruby. Cool stuff/Edit4 Rust language seems to grow as a potential C++ competitor. And everything suggests it's a good trait to follow too/Edit 1.09.2015To all of You who's been upvoting my answer for last several months. I'm elated with all Your kind words. I've never thought it's going to be so popularOnce again thanks for such amazing feedback of Yours! Quora community rocks!Cheers,Chris
earthquake resistant homes	how do earthquake resistant buildings work	1	Earthquake Resistant Design Philosophy:The engineers do not attempt to make earthquake-proof buildings that will not get damaged even during the rare but strong earthquake; such buildings will be too robust and also too expensive. Instead, the engineering intention is to make buildings earthquake-resistant; such buildings resist the effects of ground shaking, although they may get damaged severely but would not collapse during the strong earthquake. Thus, safety of people and contents is assured in earthquake-resistant buildings, and thereby a disaster is avoided. This is a major objective of seismic design codes throughout the world. Building Twist During Earthquake:A building with identical vertical members and that are uniformly placed in the two horizontal directions, when shaken at its base in a certain direction, swings back and forth such that all points on the floor move horizontally by the same amount in the direction in which it is shaken.But in most cases are buildings are not symmetrical, Hence there will be unequal amount of swing and shake. This will cause what is known as Twist or Torsion. This unequal movement will cause more damage to columns, which move more during the shake.This twist or torsion due to unequal distribution will cause maximum failure of buildings. Design :Buildings should be designed like the ductile chain. For example, consider the common urban residential apartment construction - the multi-storey building made of reinforced concrete. It consists of horizontal and vertical members, namely beams and columns. The seismic inertia forces generated at its floor levels are transferred through the various beams and columns to the ground. The correct building components need to be made ductile. The failure of a column can affect the stability of the whole building, but the failure of a beam causes localized effect. Therefore, it is better to make beams to be the ductile weak links than columns. This method of designing RC buildings is called the strong-column weak-beam design method (Figure 4). This will make the buildings better resistant to twist. Brick Masonry Structures :In case of brick masonry , the walls lying perpendicular to the direction of ground shake will fail first. Their joints will give away and the walls collapse. Hence it is important that we eliminate this kind of seismic behavior of buildings.  This can be achieved by (a) ensuring good interlocking of the masonry courses at the junctions, and (b) employing horizontal bands at various levels, particularly at the lintel level.Framed Structures : For a building to remain safe during earthquake shaking, columns (which receive forces from beams) should be stronger than beams, and foundations which receive forces from columns) should be stronger than columns. Further, connections between beams & columns and columns & foundations should not fail so that beams can safely transfer forces to columns and columns to foundations.               When the strategy of Strong Column and Weak Beam is adopted in design, damage is likely to occur first in beams . When beams are detailed properly to have large ductility, the building as a whole can deform by large amounts despite progressive damage caused due to consequent yielding of beams. In contrast, if columns are made weaker, they suffer severe local damage, at the top and bottom of a particular storey. This localized damage can lead to collapse of a building, although columns at storeys above remain almost undamaged.  The Beam Column Joints can be strengthened using more stirrups towards the joint.

is kristen stewart a bad actress  why or why not	is jennifer lawrence a bad actress	0	"She isn't a bad actress. But she is more suitable to a certain genre of films. She wouldn't be convincing as a girly, bubbly, social, next door girl character with too many dialogues. She has some mannerisms like pouting, sounding incoherent, biting her lips, running her hands through her hair constantly, which many people find distracting. You may say that she's a limited actress. But you never know. Maybe if she widens her choice, we'll be able to observe better.Twilight- She's perfect as Bella. There's a reason these movies are hits. If you think Robert Pattinson's responsible for it, then you are half correct. KStew made her Bella vulnerable, desirable, awkward, beautiful, enclosed. You could feel that the vampire wasn't able to read her like he could do with the other people. And that's a great achievement. Imagine any other actress in her place, and you could tell, that maybe they are more expressive, but Bella isn't suppose to be too expressive.Speak- She hasn't got many dialogues in this. But her silent portrayal was great.The Cake Eaters - Her body language was superb in this one.The Messengers, Cold Creek Manor- Angsty teenager played nicely.The Runaways - I am not culturally aware of Joan Jett and that band. But through interviews, Joan Jett has praised KStew for effectively playing her. And she acted nicely here.On the Road- Mary Lou in the book hardly has anything substantial to do. In the film, with all that sensuality, she was able to grab eyeballs. This film, if it has made any money, is largely because of KStew. And she's got favorable reviews for it as well.Welcome to the Rileys- She was very good in her portrayal of a ""stripper"". Again a very rebellious teen character.Adventureland , Into the wild - I found her very hot in this one :PZathura, Jumpers, Catch that kid- hardly anything to do.Panic room- I was 13-14 and developed a slight crush on her :DCamp X-Ray - She's comfortable here and her acting doesn't look fakeStill Alice - miniscule role, but the ending does leave an impactClouds of Sils Maria - WOW! She's very good here."	Yes, she is a terrible actress -just because she has an Oscar doesn’t make her a good one, since it’s more of a popularity contest nowadays anyways.Here is my opinion regarding her from another Question:Jennifer Lawrence takes overrated to a whole new level -in fact I don’t think she should be rated to begin with.She fails to impress in both acting ability as well as in looks not to mention her rude, quite trashy and completely unladylike attitude.Yet Hollywood -like so many sweethearts before her, ex. Julia Roberts- keeps shoving her up people’s throats in a way that makes the word overrated an understatement.They hail her as a great actress and shower her with awards -which ultimately means nothing since people like Gary Oldman has none and people are getting them for economic and political reason now as well as to raise the ratings of these shows- when her acting varies from terrible -mostly- to average at best.They hails her as a real woman when she’s nothing but a girl and as a breath of fresh air because she’s rude and has no manners in anyway what so ever -because that should be celebrated of course!She’s also advertised as curvy and someone who eats what she wants and doesn’t exercise when she has no waist definition and is a ruler type of body not mention her body is obviously athletic. Not that this makes anyone less of a woman but either don’t talk about it or say it like it is but don’t say something is so not true that it’s ridiculous.She’s hailed as a beauty when she is way below average in her untouched photos and only barely pretty -but looking like a CGI freak- when retouched.She’s against using sex to sell, when she’s the person most to do this -almost all of her photo shoots and magazine covers are overly sexual as well as her red carpets and interviews- except she does it in a self deprecating way so that makes it better.Apart from anything what made her famous is the worst of them all because it was her -either real or crafted- personality which is truly terrible. She epitomizes what’s wrong with society -trashy, vulgar, rude and sometimes cruel, lacks any class and mannerism and comes off as simply retarded from saying we should ban the word fat which is a simple adjective to being against Hollywood which she earns her living at as well as rejecting using sex to sell as she said regarding Miley Cyrus then doing the same she’s doing, not to mention thinking OCD is cool. She’s truly a terrible human being and the world is doomed if people admire the likes of this classless woman.
why do some japanese guys try to look feminine do not  the girls find it gross	why have most of the guys in india become so desperate do not  they know that girls do not  always look for relationships would it hurt guys to become our friend first	0	Your question is founded on two false assumptions.The notion of what is considered feminine or masculine dependents entirely on that specific culture and its own contexts. What you consider to be feminine might not be considered feminine in Japan. Therefore, you’re imposing your own culture’s gender norms on another culture, which never works. I once went on a night out with a few friends who play in the American football team for my university in Britain. When intoxicated late into the night, I saw these large, muscly men embracing one another and giving each other a peck on the cheek as an sign of friendship and camaraderie. This ‘bromance’ culture of heterosexual men hugging and kissing other heterosexual men is largely absent in Japan, and most would consider it very unusual and ‘feminine’ behaviour. I’ve also seen Italian men engaging in what I, as a Japanese, would consider to be an ‘excessive’ outpour of romantic emotion towards their partners, something that would also be considered abnormally ‘unmanly’ in Japan where men are often expected to refrain from displaying their emotion. Gender norms are social constructs and relative to that culture.Japanese men don’t actively try to look more ‘feminine’. What they do to make themselves look like they do are either gendered to be masculine or not gendered at all. Another reason why many in the West might think that Japanese men look feminine is because Japanese men, by in large, are shorter, skinnier, and younger-looking than men of other racial backgrounds. For most Japanese women, it’s generally considered unattractive if you look old and scruffy, too bulky, and especially too overweight. Grooming (shaving, plugging eyebrows, using hair products, even wearing makeup for some) and dressing fashionably are considered essential social practices in Japan, especially in the big cities.One reason why Japanese men are seen to be more ‘feminine’ is because much of the Western attention on the country focuses on what’s going on in Tokyo. And in Tokyo, you might see many men who fit into the ‘metrosexual’ category, which also exist quite abundantly in other major world cities like Paris, London, and New York; well-dressed, well-groomed, and often in good shape. If you leave Tokyo and head to the provinces, there are more men who would be considered ‘chavs’, ‘douchebags’, ‘lads’, and ‘bros’ who often display testosterone-driven aggression, barely make any effort to look presentable, are open about their misogynistic views, and like to start fights with strangers, fitting more into what you might consider to be ‘masculine’.	Let's discuss something before coming back to the actual question.The kind of movies shown in India are so rubbish and far from reality, they do not show the true meaning of life. But since youth are attracted to movies, they don't understand a very simple and basic thing, that what is shown on the screen does not necessarily happen in real life.A disgusting fact is that movies in India only focus on one part of life, that is Love, Flirting and Sex. Beating down goons to save your girlfriend, fighting for your love, flirting with girls (and thinking that they actually like it) and all the stupid and false sense of superiority is all central to the show, which in reality does not exist.You may find this amusing, but guys of today are so hard at work, constantly trying to become one of their popular 'super-heroes', while girls are busy becoming the 'super-heroines'. If the same amount of time and energy they would have spent on education, learning new things & on the various issues India is facing today, India would already have become a developed nation - a technological, cultural, and a world superpower. The funny fact is that each guy thinks that he is a 'hero'; while each girl thinks that she is the only 'heroine'; A common mentality within guys is that doing 'gundagardi' is actually heroic, while girls think that showing 'ego' and wearing short sexy clothes will make them popular.  In fact, all this is far, far from reality.  Yet still, you will find millions of idiots & fools all over India doing the same thing everyday. Youth is such an important phase of a person's life. The ability to think and act is at its peak when you are a youth. To grow in a healthy way, what India needs are not those stupid 'heroes', but the youth power who can contribute at the different levels of society - scientific, technological, medical, defence, poverty, economy, growth and overall development. The most f*cked up guys in my view are the people who make such films. They have found the magic recipe to make money - keep making those love-themed movies, and the audience will keep pouring in. But now since this pond called Bollywood is full of so many fishes called film-makers, they know the competition is fierce and the audience will only see those films which are more appealing. Hence they must keep raising the bar by making even shorter clothes, even longer kisses, more intense scenes, more revealing bodies, and do everything they can do to keep the audience glued to the screens.What they fail to realize that they have so much responsibility and power in their hands. So so bad, they don't realize they have the power to directly address such a wide audience, and that too YOUTHS! If focused and projected in the right direction, they can make a REVOLUTION! Movies can be made on such a varied topics like technology, science, space exploration, something revolutionary or eye-opening, and beautiful ways to see and live life. But sadly, in reality, that's not true. Still I believe, there will come a time, a saturation point, when all this stupidity will have to END, maybe on a bad note. I just wish I could alert the makers and the viewers before that ugly time comes. I know I have deviated a lot out of the actual question, but what I told you above is the actual 'History' and 'Science' behind it.Coming back to the point, yes, guys of today are getting increasingly frustrated and desperate, and the whole problem I explained above is the reason to blame. Everybody expects a relationship, and most of them simply find it hard to accept and think that girls can actually be friends. Its like their minds have been severely f*cked up over time so that they can't think straight anymore, or that they think that this is what is normal. The same holds true for the opposite sex.I feel so shameful to think how corrupted our minds have become. The minds of youths, the raw brainpower, which can be used to solve so many difficult, unsolved mysteries of mankind and the universe, is being wasted thinking & believing in stupid love stories which simply don't matter! I feel bad how our minds are manipulated daily, and how we so easily accept all the 'rubbish' to be 'real'. I feel sorry for all the Indians who are trapped in this vicious cycle. You are all doomed to fail, very, very hard.P.S.: I too am an Indian guy in my early twenties. I see all of this everyday, many times I too have to suffer its consequences. It has become so common and increasingly normal, that friends think that YOU are stupid if you don't do it all like they do. Its like everybody wants to be the same, but no one decides that it's TIME TO CHANGE. But I have firmly decided that I won't let myself in this trap. It's just like any addiction, that makes you crave for it, but you have to be firm and rock solid on your values, principles and beliefs so that none of it could shake you, and I try my best to stay firm on my belief. I strongly hope my fellow Indians too will understand this over time. Thanks.:)
what are the five most popular sugar daddy websites	what is it like to date a cougar or a sugar daddy	0	The biggest website for sugar dating right now is Seeking Arrangement (.com) and although there is a high number of members it doesn't necessarily mean it is the best. There is a lot of complaints by long term members that there is too many men who have signed up without qualifying funds (salt daddies).The second largest site would be Sugar Daddie (.com), this site seems to have the best reviews, especially from people who pay the $25 membership fee.Although this next site is not a sugar dating site it is owned by seeking arrangement and has rich men looking travel partners, Miss Travel (.com) so if you are interested in travel and accompanying a sugar daddy type, this site is right up your alley.Those three websites are the top contenders for sugar dating, the next couple are alternative options.Tinder: Yes, this is a dating app but sugar babies who have signed up, stated their needs and targeted older men in the search option have successfully found sugar daddies on this app, so it is definitely worth a try.	"Dating a cougar/sugar daddy is great - till it isn't. In my humble opinion, it all comes down to personality, some people have daddy/mommy issues and enjoy the controlling nature of such relationships so they prefer them. There's a huge ego trip with such relationships though and they will end dismally the moment one party starts feeling like the relationship is damaging their ego. In the case of a sugar daddy relationship - he feels more assured as a provider and socially people see him as rich/powerful provided the girl looks the part. She loves it because he's someone who's established and she can be provided for adequately - this doesn't have to be monetary - some women prefer the emotional maturity and stability sugar daddies provide more than they do the cash. Either way though - they both get an ego boost. With the cougar relationships - the cougar feels attractive, ""alive again ""and most importantly, in control of her sexuality and relationship destiny. The younger man feels the ego boost of ""having an older experienced woman"", the diminished financial pressures are great, also the fact that the cougar doesn't actively show her insecurities makes him feel more in control also (suddenly he isn't the insensitive guy messing things up).In my experience though - these relationships usually have a time limit. At some point someone is going to stop enjoying the setup. The older man feels disrespected, younger girl feels too tied down, the older woman feels less beautiful, the younger man feels too controlled, some's dad gets involved, terminal illness becomes too much to bear, family members object, etc, etc. When any of these ego shocks happen, the setup goes up in big bright flames and all parties feel bad and often contemplate not repeating such behavior again - For the ones who do stick it out - trust funds and massive inheritances await. Hang in there ;)   "
what is the vtu 1st sem exam time table of 2016 dec	how do i frame my time table for 4 months to crack gate 2016	0	VTU has released a draft layout time table for the semester exam in december - januaryIn case you want to check the exam time table then you can checkVTU Exam Time Table Dec-Jan 2017-2018 (Announced)	Assuming that you are starting from zero :Buy made easy notes. Books were better if you had more time. With the time constraint, made easy notes will do the purpose.Read them and filter out all the formulas and numerical values in a separate notebook (preferably buy 400 pages notebook for it). Your subject will be reduced to 15–20 pages per subject.Simultaneously solve Previous year questions book of GATE by made easy ( as it is mostly error free).The above exercise will take around 3 months. I have done it within 3 months hence I know it is doable.Plan things in advance, like weekly plans etc so that you don’t lose the track in between.Dedicate last one month for test series (most important). Give at least 15 full syllabus tests by giving each test on every alternate day. Write mistakes of tests on that 400 page notebook only.This 400 page notebook will be the summary of your whole engineering. Revise it fully in 1–2 days and take the test. Repeat the cycle fully in last month.After 10 tests as such (20 days passed), There will be two options, either you take 5 more tests if your scores were improved with past 10 tests, or revise the notes in last 10 days so that you can tie all the loose ends. Choose any option depending on your style.Take GATE with calm mind, don’t mess up things on the D-Day.By following above it is really impossible that you score below 40 marks. Your marks will be more than that, and if luck favours you, you will land at the IITs.My one friend did exactly this and got AIR 452 in GATE 2015 and is sitting at IIT Delhi.Thanks.

what  the best neardeath experience you have  ever had	has anyone ever had a neardeath experience	1	What's the most inexplicable experience you've ever had, whether supernatural, paranormal, bizarre coincidence, mysterious intuition, prophetic dream, or unexpected lab result?	I was 4 almost 5. My experience was not near death, it was death.I was in my bed sick. I had been very ill running fevers hitting 104. Mom says I hit 105 at some point. I remember being lowered into a cold tub of water, my mother frantically trying to bring the fever down. I would hallucinate the same thing when my fever got that high. The ceiling would start bouncing back and forth like a rubber band. It would begin lowering down on me. I would cry out thinking I was going to be crushed. In looking back now it was probably seizures.I was also vomiting every hour or less. When my stomach had nothing left I was dry heaving yellow mucus.Mom took me to the hospital seeing I was getting ready to die. I was little and my body had taken all it could. I was losing against whatever bug had hold of me.I was immediately rushed back to the ER beds and the room became busy with medical staff rushing around. They were asking mom questions as she watched me looking worried and trying not to cry.I felt so tired. I just wanted to sleep for a while. I remember telling everyone I was feeling much better. The sounds in the room started to get a hollow echo to them. I just wanted to close my eyes, so I did.The voices in the room continued to echo. I suddenly noticed my toes were touching the foot of the bed. I thought,”wow! I am a big girl!” I felt so proud. I opened my eyes to look and when I did I was looking at myself. I was laying on a gurney. I was blue. My eyes were slats. There were people around me frantically working. Mom was crying as she looked on.I wasn't upset or scared. A little confused. I knew I didn't have a body. I felt like I was part of everything and everyone. I just floated up and could see other rooms. I later detailed conversations that there is no way I could have known. I lifted out of the hospital and continued ascending. I began browsing thru time. I saw events from my short life. I later detailed things that occured before I could even talk. Things I should not be able to remember but do and in great detail. Ascended more. I felt at peace. There were no questions or unknowns. There were no fears or worries. I began drifting towards a light. It was beautiful. I wanted to touch it.Suddenly there was a pop. It felt like I was attached to a cord and someone grabbed it and jerked me down. I descended almost instantly.After that it's hazy. I obviously got better and went home. The experience has shaped me in so many ways. I know there is a place we go when we die. Oddly I still fear death. I can't understand why.So that's my near death experience. I hope it gives some one hope .
why do i keep getting fleas from my dogs	how can i keep my dog from getting fleas	1	Thanks for the ask to answer.For me it depends entirely on where you live and what activities your dog participates in as well.Spot on applications consist of a liquid that you place on the skin on the back of the neck. These as great as they are easy to do and are given monthly. However,if you wash your dog frequently or your dog goes swimming these applications will wear off faster. If you have children there is always the risk they will be exposed to the liquid.Oral tablets such as comfortis (name of product in Australia) are great as it not only kills fleas on your dog within 30 minutes of ingestion but it also prevents fleas from being able to live on your dog. There is almost no risk that children will have access to it unless your dog spits it out or vomits the tablet back up.

what year did the letter j come	when was the letter j created	1	"J was originally distinguished from the letter I at some point during the mid-1500s by a Frenchman named Pierre Ramus. The J character had existed for a while before, but was used for other purposes, not in english. The letter J originally made the ""y"" sound, but at around the same time that the letter J was introduced, many of the Western European languages made a sound shift, and began pronouncing the vowel ""y"" like the consonant  ""dʒ"" or what we now commonly use the letter J for.

harvard college courses what is general shopping advice for turkish classes	harvard college courses what is general shopping advice for tamil classes	0	Shop for (up to) four weeks, not one.It's hard to tell much about a class from the first week alone --- you typically only get two lectures to try out, and the first one is often an overview that doesn't give you a good sense of how the rest of the course will actually be run.  But the add/drop deadline is the fifth Monday of the semester (with $10 fee, or third Monday with no fee).If you're still deciding between two classes on study card day, put both on your study card.  Try out the first few weeks of both courses, then whenever you're confident you know which course you prefer, drop the extra class.There are many advantages to this approach:  You get to try out the first few problem sets (if your course has them), see how your professor lectures when it isn't shopping week, and meet the TF and other students in your section, not to mention having a better sense of whether you enjoy the material in the course and whether the level of difficulty will be appropriate for you.Sometimes even the first 3-5 weeks of a course aren't representative (CS 121, for which I was a teaching fellow, picks up quite a bit after the fifth Monday), so it's worth asking your professors what to expect.  The other main drawback is that you have to some extra work for a course you end up dropping, but the beginning of the semester isn't usually so busy anyway, and I've found I've chosen courses more wisely with 3 weeks of information rather than 1.

what are the most important books ever written	what is the most important book you have ever read	1	"I have answered a similar query Renuka Rajendran's answer to What are some of the greatest novels of all time? Why are they great?However I have left out a few absolute treasures in the list, and since I wrote that answer I have read a couple of books which just have to be included in the list of best books ever written, so here goes my list! I've limited my answer to works of fiction alone. I must add that the answer contains SPOILERS throughout.Thomas Hardy:1.Far from the madding crowd (Beautifully written book that charmingly portrays the rural landscape. The heroine is a bit vain and rejects a man who is good in every way but too simple for her tastes, but it all ends well in the end)2.Return of the Native(The dictionary defines heath as “An area of open uncultivated land, esp. in Britain, with characteristic vegetation of heather, gorse, and coarse grasses”. Not very appealing, right? But there is only one author who can make even the heath sound romantic and have you think wistfully that you were there, as he takes you through the various facets of it. You can almost feel the wrath of the stormy winds, the chills of the misty nights, the silence of its mysterious nature. ‘See’ its subtle, if not so charming, beauty. ’Return of the Native’-an enchanting, deeply moving book.3.Tess of the DurbervillesCharles Dickens:4.A tale of two cities( An epic story of love, war, sacrifice and loyalty. The ending lines in the closure of the novel which are the final thoughts of a man who sacrifices himself for the woman he loves is still etched in my heart ““It is a far, far better thing that I do, than I have ever done; it is a far, far better rest that I go to"" I think it’s one of the first novels that made me cry inconsolable tears. )5.Oliver Twist( This book did not fail to make me shed a few tears over the way poor little orphaned Oliver was treated by some cruel people who were supposed to take care of him. And when Dick says his farewell to Oliver! That was the first occasion on which Oliver had ever encountered kindness. Thank God for the happy ending for Oliver though-Dick dies)6.Great expectations(another masterpiece of Dickens’)7.David Copperfield(This book has one of the best female characters in all books I’ve read-Agnes. Lovely, kind, intelligent she’s loved David all her life and finally a tad thickheaded as he is, David realizes the fact and they get together.)George Elliot:(one of the best writers in English!)8.Middlemarch(One of the best books I’ve read with so many interesting characters in it.Dorothea, Will, Lydgate and Mary were my favorites. Beautiful written prose, insights into each character and their thought process, the problems they encounter and their reaction to it, kept me hooked to the end. A book that shows that even intelligent women in those times found it difficult to carry out an action they knew to be right without a man's approval and that how often what we perceive of others is so wrong!)9.Mill on the Floss(Another favorite of mine, even more beautifully written than Middlemarch if that’s possible and one that I connected with more than any other because it has sibling love in it.)Jane Austen10.Pride and Prejudice(Another favorite female character of all novels I’ve read-Elizabeth Bennett. Enough said!)11.Sense and sensibility12.Emma(A woman that is a shining example to her gender)13.Persuasion(Best novel of Jane Austens’ in my opinion and a must read!)14.Mansfield ParkRobert Louis Stevenson:15.Kidnapped (Best novel by this author. One couldn’t help sympathizing with David-the Hero in the book and I read the book hastily to see what destiny awaited him after he was arranged to be kidnapped by his own uncle to deprive him of his rightful property. His friendship with Alec whom he comes to love like a brother and whose affection is reciprocated- and how much he misses him when he has to part ways w..."	The Secret book by Rhonda Byrne :-This is a self help book written by Rhonda Byrne in 2006, which has been sold over 25 million books in different languages.What I learnt from “The secret” -If you focus on something with emotion, you will attract that thing to you. It doesn't matter what is it, it may be money, relationship, home, a kind of happiness, desired university etc.You should act in a way that is in congruence with your desires.What you think of, you attract into your life. Of course! So you should go for positive things.It works always but I don't know why! The best thing is you should have to practice it and you will see it changed your life.

can we do an mphil in india after doing masters in england ma in psychology	i am a masters student interested to work in humanitarian sector what are the skills required i am a medical doctor doing my masters in uk	0	It depends on what aspect of psychology you're looking into. Clinical Psychology is research and theory--playing with furry mice and then dissecting them, for example. I don't know much about the money in the research part of psych except that it can be very cut throat and if you are interested in studying something esoteric, it can be nearly impossible to get funded. OTOH, some research gets tons of funding. If you are interested in the people/counseling/teaching side of psych, then you can teach, probably on the community college level. You could probably find any number of jobs in the non-profit social service world: Case Manager for housing programs or mental health programs, for example. Depending on what you did as an undergraduate and what state you live in, you might be able to find employment in a school district, a Head Start Program, an addiction treatment center or working with domestic violence perpetrators or victims, or in prisons or with troubled youth. Different states demand different levels of extra training, usually certificates.If you are a creative thinking entrepeneur-type, you might be able to channel your Masters into something unusual, such as writing books or curriculum. The likelihood that  you will make a lot of money is slim. Unless you lucked out and landed a job with a university extension doing something in academia, you might never earn more than 47k a year. If you love your field, it's worth it. If you want to make a great income, try welding for a living.	The Humanitarian sector is quite competitive (which areas are not?) and getting 'in' might not be a straight route. You essentially have two options: 1) volunteer and 2) employed. The 2nd option is preferable but is made easier by having carried out the 1st route. If you're interested in applying your medical training/education then a few organisations pop up: Red Cross and MSF to name two. Both are very active in offering medical aid and expertise in response to disasters, complex emergencies as well as longer-term development work. However, am unsure what their entry requirements are. Certainly, I doubt they will just take anyone. Experience (in the right areas and conditions) is probably pre-requisite. Like I said, the competition is probably quite high. Volunteering as your first step is probably easier: try local areas/charities/church groups/hospitals. You need to show willing to get the work done and build your career up from the ground up. Considering local organisations shows willing and is probably easier to achieve: don't think you can just land in the middle of a MSF medical unit in Syria for example. Start early, start small but keep an eye on where you want to beGood luck!

what are some examples of deuteromycota and how are they formed	could all bitcoin mining be done by a single raspberry pi	0	All these first world problems are making me think of some third world problems:After a hard day's work in front of my laptop, I lie down on my bed and realize that the maid who made the bed before she left for the day kept the remote controls on the nightstand to the left of the bed, instead of the right side of the bed where I sleep. Which means that I'll have to stretch all the way across the bed to get the remotes. Sometimes, she even puts them on the TV stand, which means I have to get out of bed to get the remote!I have a meeting at 10:30am at a place 30 minutes away from my home (a.k.a. 5 miles), and the driver (chauffeur) comes at 10am, which means he will not have enough time to clean the car before we leave. I'll have to go in a dirty car (overnight accumulation of dust)My driver's cellphone is the same model as my cellphone - oh the horror!There's a power cut and the fan makes a slight grunting/grating sound when it is running on the inverter backup (geeks, that's because of the non-sinusoidal wave), which is very irritating, especially if it is going to keep making that noise all day.Someone in the cook's house died, so she's taking the day off. Which means that I have to cook. Which means that the kids get to eat instant noodles again, which is very unhealthy.The American economy is tanking, which means that the dollar is weak, and the resultant exchange rate fluctuation could result in 5% less money for me on the next payment from the US. But that's not all bad, because outsourcing is also likely to increase.The stupid revolution causing my Egypt vacation to be postponed indefinitely. (I guess this is a first world problem too.)Talking of ruined vacations, I can no longer go to Goa for New Year's because of all the Americans and Europeans landing up there and driving up the prices.My doctor has raised his per visit consultation fee to $3. What does he think - I'm made of money?! The psychiatrist is even worse at $10.There are 10 restaurants here which serve Mexican food, but none of them have that authentic taste (by which I mean Mexican food in the US - you know, Chilis, Taco Bell, ... I don't even know if Mexicans in Mexico eat Mexican food. I can tell you from personal experience that the pizza in Italy is nowhere near the real thing.)It's pathetic that not all movies are released here on the same day as their US release. In this day and age! And if you think that I enjoy downloading the torrentz via my third-world broadband, you're very mistaken. Waiting 2 days for a download to complete is something I'm going to stop doing as soon as they start releasing all the movies here on the same day as the US release. (And when the movie theatres here stop catering to the masses, so that I can enjoy the movie in peace without having to tolerate all these natives...)Thanks for the question. Writing this answer has been an experience of self-realization for me. The third world has indeed caught up with the developed world, and we can be just as miserable here as you guys over there. The world is indeed flat.(All the above bullet points don't apply to me. They're all friends and friends-of-friends. Not me. Honest.)	The average number of hashes performed per block in Bitcoin is controlled by the difficulty. Every two weeks, nodes in the network determine how fast blocks have been produced in the near past, and correct the difficulty required for future blocks accordingly.If all miners would agree to stop using their clusters with custom-designed chips, the difficulty would indeed drop. In theory, it can drop low enough that a single Raspberry Pi could indeed produce all blocks. Of course, it would be impossible to enforce, as mining - by design - can be done anonymously. Literally anyone in the network could decide to join with say a decent desktop computer, and claim most of the blocks.If you're talking about whether a Raspberry Pi could compete with the existing mining hardware? No, not in a trillion years. Literally. Redoing the amount of hash computation that the whole Bitcoin ecosystem has performed together in the past 49 days (june 8th - july 26, 2016) would take a Raspberry Pi 1 (I don't have numbers for 2 and 3) a trillion years (which is 72 times the age of the universe).
how racist is too racist	how racist are you	0	What!? There’s no such thing as being ‘too little’ or ‘too much’ racist. Racism is racism, and even a little bit of it is potentially damaging.And that’s not the same thing as having a preference for a particular thing. For instance, let’s say for the sake of argument that as an African-American I tend to more more comfortable around other African-Americans.That’s perfectly okay, though that doesn’t mean that I can’t have friends of different colors, beliefs or whatever.But let’s take my thought exercise a little further. Let’s say that I am uncomfortable around white people.Why am I uncomfortable? What about them bothers me in particular? I understand that the history of people of African decent and whites in this country is fraught with potential minefields, but that doesn’t mean that every white person bears any animus towards me or other African-Americans.Now, I may get to know a white person and find their behavior in some instances offensive, but that doesn’t meany ALL white people feels the same way.In other words, it’s complex though understanding starts when we not only stop pretending that we’re fine with certain differences in people, though healing starts when we see those differences, and ask ourselves why it is that we feel a particular way about them.Here’s another example. What I have come to notice is that some white people are very uneasy around black people. They cross the street when you approach, and often will pretend not to see you when you’re literally standing right in front of them.Based on what I can see, their feeling is entirely without logic because they don’t know me, and I have never hurt anyone (outside of being in a fight or two when I was younger) so they have a problem, but their problem literally has nothing to do with me, and everything to do with the baggage they’re carrying around in their own heads.Let’s take another hypothetical. Suppose you were a white person, and were mugged by some black youths. You might, understandably so, be somewhat uneasy among black youths.And if you hang on to that fear–which is what it is–then it poisons everything you see and do, which is a bit tragic.	I was born into a racist society (North Carolina in the 1940’s and 50’s). My parents were racists. My Dad believed negroes were a lesser species. I attended segregated schools. I heard that song in Sunday School that Jesus loves the little children: “Red and yellow black and white, they are precious in his sight.” I suspected this racism thing might not be what Jesus had in mind. As I progressed through high school I had more contact with more liberal sentiments. It was the 60’s and the Civil Rights movement was in flower. I went off to college in 1964. I was in the first class in my school with black students - two of them.At this point I believed black people were my equal. I believed it in my head but not in my heart. I could not talk to a black person without being patronizing. Touching a black person felt like an electric shock. I could not perceive a black woman as beautiful. I knew how I ought to behave, but I could not be authentic about it. People pick up on this stuff.After college I went to seminary. An important part of the training of a minister is practical work in a parish. This is called field work. One of my field jobs was at Grace-Hope Presbyterian Church in Louisville Kentucky. This congregation was 100% black. I started in June. I did not see a white person for three months. At the end of this period my perceptions had changed. I could shake hands with black people without feeling a shock. I had black friends. I started seeing black women as beautiful. When I watched TV I began to identify personal care products that were for whites only. My heart had changed. And people could tell it.I have a number of black friends and a black son-in-law. I have attached a picture of my grandson, who makes me as proud as I can be.Now and then I ask my black friends if they pick up any racist vibe from me. They've always told me no. I have come to believe there is one human race. We are all one color: some shade of brown. And I am certain that Jesus loves all the little children.
are canada geese really canadian	what do canadians call canada	0	"Sort of, Branta Canadensis is native to Canada and the Northern USA. The bird was named in the 18th century when ""Canada"" was the name used for the British colonies in what is now Quebec and Ontario and colloquially in Europe was a generic term for Northern North America."	"Well you see sir, I've been living in this country my whole life. You see, its a pretty, northern (sometimes chilly) country. We call it Canada. We call ourselves Canucks. The name come from the iroquois word ""Kanata"" which means up river. The explorer John Cartier understood it as ""Kanada"" and thought that was the name of the land which he was claiming. (Aboriginals treated land rights very differently than Europeans, and so the naming is not referring to a strict boundary around a plot of land, but just the general area up the river) Canada was a better way to spell it in English, and that went on the maps he brought back. I'm not sure how legitimate the story actually is, that's just what my history teacher taught me.A little information on my experiances around the world. I've left the country for a few exciting excursions and usually when I tell people I'm from Canada, they say ""oh wow! My cousin lives in Canada! Do you know them? Their name is John smith."" Or they say ""really? I thought you where American."" And I then have to explain nicely that I'm not from that but southern country, I'm from Canada. The second biggest country in the world (by land mass) which has 35 million people in it, and to drive from one side to the other can take a week.  So I like to call it what it is. Canada. Not America. Canada"

how can i become a good speaker	what should i do to be a good speaker	1	Thanks a lot for A2A Arun!If you just search for public speaking on Google, you can get plenty of resources featuring it but since still that question persists then you might be seeking personal experiences which I would try to be deliver honestly. TL;DRPublic speaking is an art of persuading people- well that's what the gist of its definitions says and that should be your aim too. Its a skill which needs to be mastered- important to be acquired but at the same time to be controlled abiding by implicit protocols. After entering the college, I felt there are plenty of occasions where you need to leave behind your hesitation - whether its asking questions from certain dignitary in any seminar or presenting your ideas before the audience- the basic thing is to overcome your fear and speak up while many non-familiar people are around.I've mentioned certain factors which would help you in enhancing your public speaking ability as they've helped me a lot-Reading - Read as much as you can- books, novels, magazines, newspapers, articles anything. More you read, more you would get to know things. You may not remember much of what you read but that's OK after all its human nature to forget which is essential too! - its psychological effect on person is equally important as its substantially adding to your knowledge. If you get involved in a conversation with an individual or speaking in an auditorium packed with people, its important that you have the sufficient knowledge of what you're speaking about along with how firmly you stays with yourself.Be honest - Who could be the better public speakers than the stand up comedians or witty celebrities?- they apart from conveying what have to say, also ensure that it reaches the audience effectively. One major factor in their proper execution is honesty. They speak whatever they have to say without bothering much about it and they're prompt too. They believe whatever they've prepared is product of careful observation, humor and wit and they're honest to their work. Personally I feel Jennifer Lawrence is a very good example of it (she is not stand up comedian officially but surely a good public speaker). Whatever she says is quite honest and that's why people admire her.Don't underestimate yourself and don't overestimate public as well- I don't think it requires much illustration. Most of the people fear about being the subject of laughter if the things didn't go well and that's where the confidence dies. Accept the fact that there will be many knowledgeable people there or you might go wrong somewhere but that doesn't matter, atleast you did what you were supposed to. Moreover, genuine people will always support you instead of laughing on your mistakes, its those people who can't do that themselves will laugh. No one cares and so should you- keep this in your mind in such situation.Aesthetics- Sometimes besides obvious factors, somethings might assist them as well but there effect might not be that conspicuous like do exercise, keep yourself healthy, do meditation for your inner peace, enhance your body language, etc. Be nice to people and never boast about yourself - it would help in bringing up a positive image of yours in people and that will certainly be a mental boost for you.Confidence- This one governs all of factors that I had mentioned and what I would mention in the following context. Have confidence in yourself that you can do it. People expect something from you when you're speaking before them and your confidence would reflect your leadership quality and determine how effectively you persuade them. The points mentioned above would certainly help you in being a public speaker but what ensures that you're good too? Reading along might help :) -Have a smile on your face while you speak. I don't how people react to it but as far as I've experience, if you have a nice smile on your face then beside making you look more confident it also psychologically urge people to have a sense of authenticity in your talk.Practice regularly and be consistent. For mastering anything you need practicing it because one doesn't simply become good at it. Talk to your friends, then small bunch of people, take part in competitions or join the clubs. Do whatever is feasible and put your effort.Don't be monotonous or dominating. Many a time, you need to listen patiently rather than making it monologue. Understand that the other people too have a share- while you speak in public, make the people feel comfortable in asking questions to you as well. Though the scenario might not be same always but it exits.Look in the audiences' eyes while you speak. Even if you have to read out some script or speak some mugged up speech, making eye contact will surely add up in making you a good speaker. Initially you may get nervous but as said earlier that's how you get better at it.Don't utter anything irrelevant or offensive. Don't try to make others fool by saying anything that may seem funny to you but has no relevance to what you're supposed to speak about. Come up with relevant examples or share your personal experiences. Keep in mind that a good speaker is the one which can interest people with his/her words so that they're bound to listen.There are plenty of apt people who would be suitable for answering your question, I just tried to share whatever I realized myself so far. Hope it helps :)Image sources- Peter Dhu & Kameron Hurley respectively.	"1. Don't study grammar too muchThis rule might sound strange to many ESL students, but it is one of the most important rules. If you want to pass examinations, then study grammar. However, if you want to become fluent in English, then you should try to learn English without studying the grammar. Studying grammar will only slow you down and confuse you. You will think about the rules when creating sentences instead of naturally saying a sentence like a native. Remember that only a small fraction of English speakers know more than 20% of all the grammar rules. Many ESL students know more grammar than native speakers.2. Learn and study phrasesMany students learn vocabulary and try to put many words together to create a proper sentence. It amazes me how many words some of my students know, but they cannot create a proper sentence. The reason is because they didn't study phrases. When children learn a language, they learn both words and phrases together. Likewise, you need to study and learn phrases. If you know 1000 words, you might not be able to say one correct sentence. But if you know 1 phrase, you can make hundreds of correct sentences. If you know 100 phrases, you will be surprised at how many correct sentences you will be able to say. Finally, when you know only a 1000 phrases, you will be almost a fluent English speaker. Don't translate When you want to create an English sentence, do not translate the words from your Mother tongue. The order of words is probably completely different and you will be both slow and incorrect by doing this. Instead, learn phrases and sentences so you don't have to think about the words you are saying. It should be automatic. Another problem with translating is that you will be trying to incorporate grammar rules that you have learned. Translating and thinking about the grammar to create English sentences is incorrect and should be avoided. 3. Reading and Listening is NOT enough. Practice Speaking what you hear!Reading, listening, and speaking are the most important aspects of any language. The same is true for English. However, speaking is the only requirement to be fluent. It is normal for babies and children to learn speaking first, become fluent, then start reading, then writing. So the natural order is listening, speaking, reading, then writing. First ProblemIsn't it strange that schools across the world teach reading first, then writing, then listening, and finally speaking? Although it is different, the main reason is because when you learn a second language, you need to read material to understand and learn it. So even though the natural order is listening, speaking, reading, then writing, the order for ESL students is reading, listening, speaking, then writing. Second ProblemThe reason many people can read and listen is because that's all they practice. But in order to speak English fluently, you need to practice speaking. Don't stop at the listening portion, and when you study, don't just listen. Speak out loud the material you are listening to and practice what you hear. Practice speaking out loud until your mouth and brain can do it without any effort. By doing so, you will be able to speak English fluently. 4. Submerge yourselfBeing able to speak a language is not related to how smart you are. Anyone can learn how to speak any language. This is a proven fact by everyone in the world. Everyone can speak at least one language. Whether you are intelligent, or lacking some brain power, you are able to speak one language. This was achieved by being around that language at all times. In your country, you hear and speak your language constantly. You will notice that many people who are good English speakers are the ones who studied in an English speaking school. They can speak English not because they went to an English speaking school, but because they had an environment where they can be around English speaking people constantly. There are also some people who study abroad and learn very little. That is because they went to an English speaking school, but found friends from their own country and didn't practice English. You don't have to go anywhere to become a fluent English speaker. You only need to surround yourself with English. You can do this by making rules with your existing friends that you will only speak English. You can also carry around an iPod and constantly listen to English sentences. As you can see, you can achieve results by changing what your surroundings are. Submerge yourself in English and you will learn several times faster.  5. Study correct materialA common phrase that is incorrect is, ""Practice makes perfect."" This is far from the truth. Practice only makes what you are practicing permanent. If you practice the incorrect sentence, you will have perfected saying the sentence incorrectly. Therefore, it is important that you study material that is commonly used by most people. Another problem I see is that many students study the news. However, the language they speak is more formal and the content they use is more political and not used in regular life. It is important to understand what they are saying, but this is more of an advanced lesson that should be studied after learning the fundamental basics of English. Studying English with a friend who is not a native English speaker is both good and bad. You should be aware of the pros and cons of speaking with a non native speaking friend. Practicing with a non native person will give you practice. You can also motivate each other and point out basic mistakes. But you might pick up bad habits from one another if you are not sure about what are correct and incorrect sentences. So use these practice times as a time period to practice the correct material you studied. Not to learn how to say a sentence. In short, study English material that you can trust, that is commonly used, and that is correct."

who is more electable in a general presidential election donald trump or ted cruz	who is more delusional donald trump or ted cruz	0	As strange as it is to say, probably Trump.Let's start with the disclaimer that both of them are likely to be in a world of hurt when they reach the general election -- both are massively unlikeable in their own ways. But Trump's appeal, such as it is, does have some ability to cut across party lines whereas Cruz is ONLY going to appeal to the portion of the Republican base that doesn't hate his guts. Republicans will hold their noses and vote for Trump, and he might pick up some Democrats and independents who like his brand of bombast; even if everyone holds their nose and votes for Cruz, it's hard to imagine any Democrats and independents doing so.Honestly, if there's a Republican that scares me this time around, it's Rubio. His positions are pretty much just as bad as Cruz or Trump, but he's managed to avoid swimming in the cesspool with them.	Cruz and how he shows how a pathetic little loser he is.He will take a hit on his political career for this and showed how he is a marionette for the elite.. aka just another ordinary political opportunist.
what do you think about the bermuda triangle	what are your theories about bermuda triangle	1	Bermuda Triangle is the greatest unsolved mystery of the modern age. Also called Devil's Triangle.

do mexican girls like black guys	do girls like black guys with no beard	0	Depends on where you are living. In the city I live in (Orlando, FL) there is a lot of diversity here. When I was teaching at a school, there were quite a few Hispanic girls chasing after African American boys. So the demographic has to do a lot with your question, I think. If you live in a highly populated area with several cultures living together, it is far more likely to see interracial couplings.	Girls like men who have a good physique, excellent dressing sense, who smell like men, have confidence and who can appreciate and adore them with sweet compliments all the time!Did that answer anywhere included the term black guy or white guy?
can you debeak cockerels at 8 months old	how much and with what should i feed my 3 months old raven	0	"A primer on your height & what you can do about itYour height is determined between 60%-85% by your genetics. The remainder of that is environmental, primarily nutrition[1]. If you're malnourished during your growing years you won't reach your full potential. If you get enough nutrition you'll likely reach your genetically predetermined height, possibly a little taller.There is some indications that getting enough protein through your developmental years can add to your height positively. In Japan after the war, the population had access to more fish protein and the average height of the country increased 3 inches[2]. Denmark has become one of the tallest countries in the world, and it's rise in height is strongly correlated to it's wealth per capita .[3] The most likely take away here is that people that can afford to eat, and eat well, will be taller over generations. It’s easy to make this connection between these two long term correlations. Nutrition can slowly cause an increase in height between generations. It's no guarantee that you'll be taller through eating, but proper nutrition through your formative years, can add a bit onto your genetics. A good, balanced diet of fats, proteins, and carbohydrates -- eat food, not too much, mostly plants -- you'll do fine.They've been doing some research on fraternal twins to try to determine what the specific gene is that determines height. The reason that they're looking at fraternal twins rather than identical twins is that their exact DNA is different but most of the environmental factors are the same (what the mother ate while they were pregnant, probably how they were treated after they were born, etc). They can then compare the genomes of the twins after they reach their height and see what is different between them. They do this for thousands of fraternal twin pairs to determine which parts of their genomes are different. As of writing this they think it's partly in the X chromosome and chromosomes 7, 8, and 20. Scientists haven't narrowed it down entirely, genes are pretty complex and it's not as simple as it's explained in your general science classes with recessive genes and dominant genes.[4]As you grow up, your bones get longer. Everyone has Epiphyseal plates at the ends of their bones. As you grow, these plates are added onto. When you go through growth spurts, particularly puberty, they are added onto rather quickly. Some people experience growing pains in their bones as they expand. When you're done growing (mostly by the time you're 18-25), your bones Ossify, the epiphyseal plates seal themselves, and you stop growing taller and longer. At that point you're done. No more growing. That's it.How do I know if my Epiphyseal plates have sealed?I’m going to quote this answer: Thomas Johnson's answer to How do you know when your epiphyseal plates are sealed (disregarding age)? (Please go and up vote his answer if you find this portion illuminating)When looking at an x-ray of your limbs, look for the line between the diaphysis (shaft of the long bone) and epiphysis (rounded articulation/ where the joint lies). Here is a picture of the epiphyseal plates of the distal tibia and fibula in an ankle:You can easily see the dark line above both ""ankles"" or malleoli. These are the epiphyseal plates you are looking for. Here is a picture when the ""growth plates"" are ""sealed"":You can see the white line on both sides of the knee, known as an epiphyseal scar. The white line means the area is more dense, whereas the dark line from before means it is the less dense, growing cartilaginous tissue. If the white line exists, it means the epiphyseal plate has ""closed"" and no additional bone will grow from the cartilage.Daily fluctuationsYour height actually decreases slightly through the day. In between your spinal disc s there are fluid sacs. When you stand up your head and shoulders put a..."	Ravens are omnivores, but prefer meat. I hope you are not squeamish because the best things to feed him are, in order, baby mice or pieces of baby chick, water-soaked high protein dog food, scrambled eggs, and fresh fruits and vegetables. Half of his food should be baby mice or baby chick; you can vary this with chicken hearts and livers, other raw meat scraps, or turkey parts, but not too often, because our commercially raised animals are full of hormones and antibiotics and would not replicate his natural diet. If you can handle picking up fresh roadkill and cutting it up for him to tear into, that would be ideal. He should be given all of the roadkill, guts included. If you can’t deal with this, you should give him chicken wings or turkey necks to allow him the natural behavior of tearing the meat off the bone. Allow him to eat as much as he wants; ravens won’t overeat. As he gets older you can graduate him to bigger mice until he is eating fully adult mice.You can vary his diet with rabbits, frogs, crayfish, snakes, lizards, salamanders, rats, grasshoppers, cutworms and mealworms.If you keep your raven healthy, he could live to be 40 years old.
how do we avoid whey in yogurt	is bad breath a sign of a strong stomach	0	I make yogurt much of the time utilizing 2% drain and the whey dependably isolates a bit. Indeed, even locally acquired yogurt does this. (However, maybe I'm not understanding your question.)We generally strain the yogurt in a colander fixed with material (i.e., cheesecloth) over a bowl to permit a great part of the whey to deplete out. This is on the grounds that we like the yogurt to be thicker. This is significantly more work, in any case, in the event that you favor less whey then you could attempt this strategy. However, understand that notwithstanding doing this the whey will pool in the yogurt and that is alright.	Here's what both a pediatrician and a pediatric dental practitioner informed me relating to one kid with chronically bad breathe (I do not know if this applies to adults, therefore I made sure and indicated it is a pediatric doctor and pediatric dentist)... They both said it was the sign of an active metabolism and optimum calorie burning. It's not necessarily going to be bad news, as was the case when we went in.Do you find yourself keeping a distance from people or trying to constantly mask bad breath? Embarrassed when people find out or constantly trying to mask it with mints and sprays? Yep. I've been there. Halitosis can screw with your relationships, your career and your self-esteem. Rather than try to constantly mask it you're much better to deal with the root of the issue with something like this: http://dumphalitosis.space

The gods made that [women], and it delights me. The gods made this [men]... and it delights me. When it comes to war I fight for Dorne, when it comes to love — I don't choose sides.""This is a quote from Game of Thrones, and the philosophy is a compelling one. If one has a desire, but does not act upon it, they are denying themselves the pleasure of experiencing what the world has to offer. We live in a world and a society that has become quite open and free for the gay and bisexual community, that there seems to be no reason why one should feel ashamed of experiencing their desires. In this case, my advice is to treat this just as a typical love-interest. Ask her out, tell her how you feel, she can only respond in one of two ways; either she will be attracted to you as well, in which case life will be just dandy, or she will not be, which happens in our everyday lives as well."

why does massaging one  temples soothe a migraine or headache	what are the causes and most effective ways to treat or cure migraine headaches	0	"Massaging your temples or another's temples to soothe a headache can help with the pain in several different ways: distraction from the pain and also maximization of circulation and optimal myofascial (muscle/connective tissue) function.   This answer is mainly directed toward someone with a headache in the temple region, outside of the eyes.  The answer may be different for someone with a headache in a different region of the head.  When you massage the temples, you can do several techniques: mainly friction (rubbing across the skin) or various methods of kneading (rubbing into the skin and underlying tissues).  Friction mainly is for draining pain-inducing chemicals from the tissues, to be resupplied with fresh blood supply, which essentially ""cleanses"" the tissue of pain and result in inflammation.  Kneading (like the circle patterns we usually do) is to break up areas of myofascial tension and adhesion to underlying structures via repeated tension cycles. This will be for several goals: to break apart connective tissue that is cutting off blood/lymph/nerve supply and also to stimulate and reset optimal fluid flow in the tissue.   Now, if you apply constant pressure to trigger points in the temporalis muscle, you will get relief from tension in the following areas (of red/referred pain):The tricky part is that these areas can be referred and triggered from other areas, which is a whole other question.  But, it does feel good to release these points if you have a tension headache.  If one has a true migraine, they may release part of the tension headache component with this, but the true migraine is unfortunately a different beast. It requires much more complete and systemic measures to address."	I am writing this based on 30 years of my own experience of reducing migraine headaches sans medicines. So, this is a proven method, which can be used by all migraine-affected people, with zero side effects. It reduces the frequency of migraine attacks substantially, for sure. Here is my simple but very very effective remedy to prevent/reduce migraine headaches:always cover your eyes with a good-quality pair of sunglasses & also cover your head with a comfortable cap/hat, whenever you go out in the sun/in any kind of glare. Wear the sun-glasses & the cap/hat all the time when you are outdoors, or when you feel that the glare is too much to bear;Eat something at your daily-intake times, without exceptions. What you eat & how much you eat is secondary. What is vital is to feed your stomach at regular intervals, or at/around the time you normally consume food everyday. This eradicates the ill-effects of bile & prevents headaches;Do not keep awake late at night. Ideally, a 11 pm to 6 am sleep is desirable. Also, try to stick to your daily routine, to the extent feasible & avoid erratic daily routines as far as you can;Keep stress as low/less as feasible. Try your best & then, accept the results coolly. Worrying over what is beyond your control is a invitation to migraine headaches;Have more fruits, salads, nuts & other natural foods. Avoid processed/non-veg./fried foods, or consume as less of it as may be possible;For peace of mind, do meditation (focus on breathing) daily, morning & night. Vipassana meditation is very good;Keep this attitude as regards the results, after putting in your best efforts: 0% expectations & 100% acceptance. This will reduce stress & thus, reduce the frequency & intensity of headaches. Do your best & then, accept the outcome with grace & equanimity. This attitude will reduce headaches.
which one is better among kmc manipal and kmc mangalore	what is the brief comparison of kmc in manipal and mangalore	1	I DO NOT regret joining MIT, Manipal.Before coming to Manipal, after going through all the admission processes of various colleges, I finally got into SRM, Chennai (kattankulathur) with Mechanical (which I wanted) and I was satisfied and happy about. I didn't want to apply or appear for any other college after finally securing a good seat. And then I received my MIT's counselling dates. My mother and my aunt (who did her MBBS from KMC, Manipal) convinced me to just visit the place once for counselling. I finally agreed as I already had paid for SRM, so no harm in just visiting Manipal. When we (me and my mother) landed in Mangalore, the airport, long drive to Manipal and the rains were a big turn-off for me. My mother was very optimistic about the place. We didn't book the rooms in good hotels before coming, so we finally got a room at Hotel Ashlesh (for the price of one room in Fortune Inn Valley View). Another big turn-off. Next day, we went to the campus and got into the campus tour bus. After seeing Marena, Audio-visual theatre, Edu Building, the campus, facilities, hostels, medical insurance facilities for students, international hostels, etc., I just wanted to cancel my SRM allotment and come and join Manipal (even if I were I getting Biomedical Engineering). So, that's how I got into Manipal.After a year of failing 9 out of 12 subjects and getting a year-back, I questioned my decision of joining Manipal and whether I was really interested in the field of Engineering or just joined the Bandwagon. The next six months I was at home, thinking about my past and future, and concluded that I was more into Business Management than Engineering, and that I joined the Bandwagon and was trying to become just another engineer. As I couldn't get any admission in any college in the mid of the year, I decided to finish what I started (pass all the subjects which I failed) and then start applying for Business colleges. I re-registered for 8 subjects and cleared all in that one semester with a rise in GPA from 2.14 GPA to 7.4 GPA. During that period, one of the professors and mentor (Prof. Dashrathraj K Shetty) offered me a project if I were to stay back during vacations. I stayed back for those two months, published a few research papers in the field of Management after completing the project, during those holidays. I joined other senior professors along with my mentor for an international conference for Business Management and got the best paper award among all the other researchers. I later, went on to represent MIT for the Social Entrepreneurship Conclave organised by Fourth Ambit and the Government of Karnataka where we won the third prize. I joined Lions Clubs of Manipal University and became the president after a year. So, being in an engineering college, I learnt management and entrepreneurship, something that I always wanted to do.So, I don't regret any part of being an MITian. Next year, this time, I'll get a degree in B. Tech. with a lot of experience in Business Management. MIT always provides you with opportunities. It's on you, how you utilise them. And if you start regretting your decisions, you will never learn from that phase of life. Instead, start enjoying every moment, no matter what your circumstances are. Be determined and tackle your hurdles with ease, cause the hurdles are going to get bigger at every stage, only thing that can change is your ability to deal with them.Things are always going to get better. How worse can they be?My LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/name...	Either of the kmc colleges in Mangalore and Manipal Belong to the same University. If you prefer to stay in a big city or you are a metro city addict then Mangalore may suit you well as it has all facilities of a developed city that is international airport to huge malls and many star hotels and restaurants and many luxury apartments with sea view. Urban sprawl of Mangalore is bigger than manipal. College buildings in mangalore are scattered across the city but manipal as a whole is itself a campus. Culture of people is same in both places as both belongs to tulunadu. Academics are both good.
why are my best friend still ignoring me	what should i do when my best friend is ignoring me	0	We were sitting in KFC’s small outlet. (We had no choice.)Both hungry after 8 hours of jee-mains lectures which hammered our every last desire to live.I ordered a regular sized paneer zinger burger & fries. He ordered some tender juicy chicken wings.I brought in our orders. The AC was too rough which made the urge to pee greater than the urge to hog in food.But when I returned, half my fries were missing along with a huge bite of my burger. I felt a current of anguish and pain running through my spine. The only person I trusted, the only person who knew I’m vegetarian & would not even taste his stuff, betrayed me & was now devouring on his chicken, half immersed in that bucket!I knew this was the end of friendship. I knew something greater than bro-code, the pen-ultimate Joey code was broken.I never trusted that guy again, I never left my fries under his watch again!If you were expecting a story of friendship seeing an end because one of them got a girl, that’s pretty much normal for me these days.Image source: Pinterest.	First of all….relax urself for a few days. Stay away from ur cellphone. Eat good. Sleep good. N avoid thinking anything about ur relationships.U must honestly explain ur situation to both the guys. Both of them have right to know ur views. Don't forget the fact that things won't remain the same anymore. Don't even expect to be.Accept the new moods. People have a tendency to leave…..so do they.. U are not the only one facing such issues. Everyone has such phase in their relation.Ask S clearly what he wants…whatever be his decision.. Respect it. Also share it with R. Don't cheat him in anyway. A good bond has place for all the anger n chaos.Talking clearly is the only solution.Hope everything gets smooth soon. Take care.

what are the best ways to properly finger yourself	what would be the best way of keeping yourself amused in a prison	0	"First & foremost you need to check this links  http://www.tnlounge.com/1180/how...http://www.tnlounge.com/sexualityQuick Note: Make sure to trim and file your fingernails, and wash your hands beforehand to prevent any injury or infection.You're going to be probing inside your body, so you want to use proper hygiene.Step 1: Relax and Start With Your Nipples Begin by taking a warm shower or bubble bath to relax, empty your bladder, and make sure you have some uninterrupted privacy time. Gently caress your breasts and focus on your nipples. Try stroking or pinching them until they begin to get hard and erect. If your breasts are large enough, you might try to lick the nipples yourself. Fondling your breasts is a great way to get in the mood for self-gratification.Step 2: Include Your Vagina While continuing to caress your breasts with one hand, use your other hand to tease your body and begin to explore your vagina. Gently run your hand along the parts of your body that are more sensitive to touch than others, such as your belly button, before reaching your vagina. Eventually you'll want to focus on your cl*tor*s by sliding back the hood. Try rubbing or stroking it using two fingers to expose the clit, while keeping your other hand busy with your breasts.Step 3: Finger Yourself As the excitement begins to well up, your breathing may become shorter and shallower. Remember to keep breathing while continuing to caress your breasts, and stroke your cl*t until your arousal fluids begin to flow. When you are ready, move your finger(s) into your vagina simulating intercourse. Experiment by learning how to finger yourself using the hook method by shaping your finger(s) into the shape of a ""C"" when sliding them in and out, and remember to continue rubbing your cl*t with the palm of your hand. This will accomplish what only a hand and finger(s) can do, and that is stimulating both your cl*t and your G-spot at the same time.Step 4: Stimulate Your G-Spot You can locate your G-spot two to three inches inside the top wall of your vagina. You'll know you have got it when you feel a small cluster of skin with the texture of walnut. A lot of girls can achieve an orgasm by stimulating the G-spot. Gently rubbing the G-spot leads to a vaginal orgasm that is much deeper and stronger than a clitoral orgasm and the good news is you can have multiple orgasms in the same session.Step 5: Try Different PositionsYou can finger yourself in a number of other positions besides the missionary position.From behind: Try fingering yourself from behind while laying on your back by reaching around your lower back, over your anus, and inserting your finger(s) into your vagina. The disadvantage is that this position makes it difficult to stimulate the G-spot; however, the advantage is that you can stimulate your an*s with the palm of your hand at the same time.Sitting: There are several ways to learn how to finger yourself while in a sitting position. Try using the headboard on your bed to support your back, or the top of a dresser with your back against the wall. The advantage of fingering yourself in this way is it allows for deeper penetration with your finger(s).Standing: You can also finger yourself standing up. Try using a chair to prop up one foot and have at it. The wonderful thing about masturbating while standing is that you have the best of both worlds, the option of front or rear entry. Just make sure you have something to hold on to when you reach a climax. If you really want to get a little bolder, try watching yourself in the mirror while masturbating.Doggy: Although a bit more primitive, going doggy style is just another way to enjoy self-gratification. Just get on your knees, throw your 6utt in the air, and with your head down reach around and let your finger(s) create the magic. Try it, you may like it.NOTE It is very important that you have an appreciation of your own body and how to finger yourself. Besides, it only stands to reason that the more you masturbate and become comfortable being sexual with your own body, the more you'll want to be sexual with your partner. Self-gratification is going to stimulate the part of the brain that is going to keep your libido alive, it's extremely sensual, and you will be so turned on that you might just kiss your social life goodbye for a short while.Read more about sextalk at http://www.tnlounge.com/1180/how..."

how do scientists work	where do scientists work	0	The process is actually ridiculously simple. Scientists perform science the same way a child learns to open a tap. They try one thing, with a result in mind (e.g. turning a tap will result in it releasing water). If it happens, great - they then try to explain why this is the case (e.g. water pressure from below ground drives water up and through the tap when it is opened). If it doesn’t happen, they try to explain why that happened (e.g. I turned the tap the wrong way, the opening of the tap remained closed, and therefore no water was able to escape), and then try another method (e.g. turning the tap the other way).It’s literally just trial and error. It’s so simple that there’s even some evidence that animals can do this. The reason why scientists still have jobs is because the problems they tackle are usually much more complex (e.g. there are millions of factors that influence whether a person develops cancer) and require much more complicated methods to try and test than just turning a tap on and off. However the principle always remains the same.	Differentiate scientists from engineers:Engineers are generally only dedicated to building things using knowledge that exists. Scientists can also sometimes do that, but they spend more time looking at things that no one knows anything about.For example, if Jim doesn't know how an engine is constructed but he is required to design pistons in an engine and he spends time researching engine construction, he's still an engineer. But if Jim spent his time working on creating a recipe for a new material to make pistons out of, and that material is something no one knows anything about, then he's a scientist.In general, engineers know more about building things - they typically don't have a PhD (but they can). Scientists almost always have a PhD, and they only know little bits about how to build things. Scientists spend more time analyzing things in broad strokes, in generality, but engineers spend more time looking at the minutiae. But things become confusing since many scientists start out as engineers and the other way round. Also scientists have to frequently build things - they sometimes seek the help or employ engineers, but it is as likely that they figure out how to build things themselves as well. The engineers that scientists employ are sometimes called 'R&D engineers' - and they sometimes like to think of themselves as scientists.Engineers in general have more breadth in topical knowledge over scientists and scientists have more depth in a few topics. Engineers go to scientists when a very specific piece of the puzzle doesn't fit nicely.To conclude, there's also a third category - technicians. Not to knock against them, but they also like to self-identify themselves as scientists or engineers. In my personal opinion, there are far fewer engineers than scientists (that are already very few). Most people are merely technicians looking up things and implementations.
what is the condition of tourism in pakistan	preferable pg courses for be eee student in tamil nadu	0	Pakistan and India may be the only countries who have been blessed with all kind of weathers and landscape simultaneously. India as usual has upper hand here too. Yearly thousands of tourists visits India but on the other side Pakistani government and tourism department failed to attract the tourists from all over the world. This even became more worse with ongoing bad security situation in Pakistan.Pakistan has beautiful land and natural beauty is one of the blessings of Allah we have. But we also have the most dumbest people working in our departments who can't make good policies. Bottom line is Pakistan's tourism industry is going through a bad phase but situation is becoming better now. 	You can apply to various PSU and Tangedco. But these type of in-plant training will not do any significant help during your placement. Instead try to learn programming skills, Data analytics or apply with some startups where you get a very good learning experience.Basically you need to understand that the work going on an electrical site is very serious and generally it takes engineers years of experience to handle the heavy electrical machinery therefore they dont allow any fresher to just walk in and work without proper training.You can apply with NTPC as they have a very well structured in plant training during summer.

what are the best selfhelp books you have  ever read	what are the top self help books i should read	1	I would like to learn how to stop thinking about what other people think of me. That said, what is the best self help book you've ever read on this subject?	"Here are a few of my favorite books that changed the way I live. They have changed the way I look at the world and the way I react to the world. I revisit them frequently because I get more out of them every time I go through them.However, books cannot change your life – only you can do that. Simply reading the book alone, then moving on to the next one is useless.The books can guide you down the right path, but you must take massive action and dedicate yourself to doing the work.Grit: The Power of Passion and Perseverance by Angela DuckworthAchievement isn’t reserved for only talented individuals, but for those with passion and perseverance.Grit is about what creates outstanding achievement in people. Through her own story of success, research, science, and interviews with high achievers from various fields, Angela Duckworth reveals what it takes to persevere in any situation.Key Takeaways:Grit = perseverance + passion + purposeWe obsess over talent because it protects our ego – if we believe we either have it or we don’t, we don’t have to feel bad about not measuring up.Effort has a much greater impact on achievement than talent.Combine small, low-level, daily goals with a larger vision to stay consistently motivated.Grit is changeable with:Interest: enjoy what you’re doingPractice: deliberate practice to improve on your weaknesses to constantly improvePurpose: know that your work mattersHope: believe in yourself. Have a growth mindsetPeak: Secrets from the New Science of Expertise by Anders Ericsson and Robert PoolIf you’ve heard of the “10,000 Hour Rule,” then you’ve heard of Anders Ericsson’s work, but you may not know the entire story.His work has been both lauded and debated, but it’s finally time to properly examine the truth.Key Takeaways:The path professionals take is called “purposeful practice” and it consists of four parts.Have a clear, specific goalRemain focused during practice with no distractionsAlways push yourself just beyond your limits to achieve moreGet specific and immediate feedbackWhen you practice in a mature field of expertise and have someone to guide or mentor you, purposeful practice becomes deliberate.True genius isn’t an innate talent – but the mere result of years of deliberate practice.Mindset: The New Psychology of Success by Carol S. DweckWhat’s the difference between people with a fixed and a growth mindset. Turns out A LOT!Success in school, work, sports, the arts, and almost every area of human endeavor can be dramatically influenced by how we think about our skills, talents and abilities.Key Takeaways:People with a fixed mindset – those who believe that their abilities are fixed – are less likely to flourish. These people think ""This was the way I was born. Therefore, this is how I'll always be.""People with a growth mindset – those who believe that abilities can be developed – have the capacity to reach outstanding accomplishments. These people tell themselves ""I can achieve whatever I set my mind to.""Change your mindset to one of growthBe curious and constantly ask questionsTry to learn something new every dayPick something that you're not good at and try to improve by finding a coach, taking a training course, watching instructional videos, and PRACTICING!Whenever you find something you wish you were good at, always tell yourself you CAN if you put your mind to itTurn challenges and failure into motivation and creative problem-solvingDon't ever give up. If you reach a plateau, keep your true north star goal in mindSurround yourself with people with positivity, grit, determination, and passion (they have a growth mindset)Dream bigThe Power of Habit: Why We Do What We Do in Life and Business by Charles DuhiggHabits are at the core of everything you do. When you learn to change them, it will have a major impact on you, your life, your business and society.Key Takeaways:The habit loop sta..."
is evernote useful	what is evernote used for	1	At first it will seem useless, as you will end up using it for brief notes (you never refer to), clipping web articles (you most likely won’t read again) and creating shopping lists. You can do these with a range of other apps. So for the first few months the benefit will be negligible or zero.The key to finding Evernote useful lies in integrating it with how you work; in my case I use it as my information and ongoing thoughts store. So if I get important emails with attachments, I put them in there, write comments and tags and (depending on how you use Evernote) then put it in a notebook. Other things you can do are add meeting minutes, store other files (with your own summaries attached) and almost replace your paper notebooks. I still use the latter, but now I scan my notebook pages into Evernote (which I can search in). You can create reminders and to do lists.If you dump information into Evernote, it will quickly become chaotic. One useful feature is that you can link different notes (pages) together. This can save a lot of time if you currently have to search lots of emails or various file stores. Tagging and notebooks are critical to staying organised, so look up some tips online.One useful think I have found is to create two folders in My Documents on my computer, one is the working folder where I have for example all Word files I am editing for a particular project. I then have an Evernote Sync folder. Once a document is complete, I move it to the Sync folder and erased from my computer. If I need to find the file again I go to Evernote. Don’t forget that services such as IFTTT and Zapier to connect lots of online services together and can automatically feed information into Evernote. This can include creating a daily summary of all the files changed in shared folders or data from CRM systems. Integration with third party systems such as Google Docs/Drive is useful and improves workflow.Evernote is only useful if you make use of its many features like notebooks, links and tags plus also use it as your main data store. However, if you do that, it is a lifesaver in this age of email and endless Cloud file folder options. Don't forget there are many excellent tutorials online and it is a matter of finding the right usage style for you.A long answer, but I hope it helps. I have no connection with Evernote.

a title for my continuation to the gift of the magi	how do i start my continuation for the gift of the magi	0	"A  saint who was visiting river ganga to take bath found a group of family members on the banks shouting in anger at each other.. Then the sain turned to his disciples,...smiled and asked ""why do people shout at each other when they are in anger""... ..His disciple thought for a while , then one of them said .."" Because we lose our calm,we shout""...."" but why should you shout when the other person is just next to you? You can as well tell him what you have to say in a soft manner"" said the saint...The disciples gave some other answers but none satisfied the saint...Finally the saint explained"" when two people are angry at each other their hearts distance a lot and to cover that distance they must shout to be able to hear each other.... However when they are in love ,their hearts are very close and even silence speaks a thousand words""....."	"I have to buy something for him. Something special. Something that would remind him of me constantly. It was their wedding anniversary and she felt lost. She had so many gifts in mind but every single one of them would cost a fortune. They barely managed to pay for daily necessities. How was she going to buy him the unforgettable gift? She took out her purse and started counting. 100. 200. 250. 258. Not a rupee more. What could she possibly buy for such paltry amount and at the same time, mesmerize him? She had  2 more hours until he got back home. She had to think something quick. This is not happening. She looked around the house in despair - hoping she'd find something good enough to sell. The house was barely furnished and all they had was old stuff their parents were gracious enough to give as wedding gifts. That's when she laid eyes on her sitar. It suddenly reminded her of this sly music shop owner who mentioned he can fetch her a good price for it. The sitar was part of her family tradition. Her grandmother played it. Her mother played it. Her childhood evenings were spent learning that sitar. She even played it for the entire school audience. It had become a part of her. But I'm not that girl anymore. I have only one responsibility now and that is to make my other half happy. I haven't even touched it for years. She lugged the sitar to the nearby music shop. ""How much can you give me for this?"" she asked the owner. ""This is very old. The strings look like they might collapse any minute. Is it even in tune?""""Oh, yes it does. I tune it every other month,"" she lied through her teeth, ""let me play it for you."" She played the tune she learnt from her mother. As she wrapped it up, the owner just stared at her, mouth wide open. Few more seconds passed and he started clapping. ""That was beautiful. You should play for an audience."" He remarked. He continued, ""I'll loan the money to you. Till you return it to me, I'll keep the sitar in my possession. How much do you need?"" ""Rs. 5000,"" she said without blinking. ""That's too much."" He inspected the sitar. ""I can give you Rs. 3500. In the current market, you won't get more than Rs. 2500 for this. The strings in this sitar are very old. No one uses them anymore.""She was beaming inside. She had already started making a mental list of all the things she could buy with that money. ""That's fine,"" she blurted out. As soon as she had the money in her hands, she headed straight to the gift shop. And there it was, the perfect gift for her husband. A heart-shaped slot where two photos can be inserted. Her husband always wore his family heirloom - a gold locket -  around his neck. This would perfectly fit into the locket. She knew he'd love it and at the same time, it'd constantly remind him of her. She rushed back to the house and started cooking his favourite snack. He's going to love my gift. As he entered home, she was waiting at the door for him. ""How was your day?"" she asked. ""Nothing remarkable. You?""""Me too."" she pause for a few seconds and continued, ""Do you know what day today is?""""Of course! Our wedding anniversary! And I think I have the perfect gift for you.""""Yeah, me too! But you show me mine first!""""Okay. Remember how you always wanted to play the sitar as a profession? I bought you new strings and booked a show for you in this fancy new auditorium. You will open for Ravi Shankar! It's going to make you an instant celebrity!""It took her a few seconds to grasp the situation. He continued, ""Your turn. What do you have for me?"" She produced the heart-shaped slots.""This will go perfectly well with your gold locket."" That's when she noticed that he wasn't wearing it today. ""Where is it?"" ""I sold it to book your show,"" he admitted sheepishly.

i argued with my gf that she made friends with the person that hit on her she said i am a control freak and she wants her freedom what should i do	i am a girl in middle school my best friends are all girls i have  found out that i am bisexual how do i tell my best friend who  a girl without her freaking out and it changing our whole friendship	0	Don't listen to this fuckheads. I have stolen other mans girlfriends and wife's like it was child's play. Precisely because they just wanted to be “friends” or “hangout”.Your insecurities, tell you that there's something wrong with your current emotional content.You have every right to feel the way you do, you have every right to make your demands on your relationship, that will bring you piece of mind and conform.It's not like asking her to cut ties with these particular people will have such a devastating effect on her current life.It's not like her want, because is definitely not a need to have contact with this people is detrimental to her happiness. And if she says it is then kick her to the curve.Because it means that this people are holding hostage some of her emotional content and the only way they can do that is that she gave them that power.And no one, especially no other man should have any power over your girls emotional content. You should be the only one that has just some of that power. And that's because she gave it to you.Because of the chemistry you guys have or in this case had. And that's the problem here, shes building this chemistry with other man, which means she will feel affection for these other man. And it doesn't matter if she acts on it or not.The fact that she was willing to share that bond with someone else, while you loose sleep and feel like at any moment your world will be turn upside down is cause for termination.Don't listen to this ridiculous ideas, that's okay if your girl is hanging out with some dude, who has a hard-on for your girl. Because in one moment of weakness (i.e. Drunk, drugs, perfect scenario were you won't find out.) this dude will cream-pie your girl.Don't lie to yourself to think your girl is different. That's shes a saint that couldn't possibly cheat on you. Because you girl is not above the laws of attraction.I know I have done it. Monogamous relationship are not natural. As such there must be a constant, conscious commitment to stay loyal to your partner. And most times that means to cut ties with other humans beings that can potentially alter your emotional content.Essentially cutting ties with threats.And while this idea of layolty is created among the participants of said realitionship, you can bet your ass is okay if one of those ideas is for your girl to stay away from douchebags, like myself who don't care if we fuck your girl and your world up.	"If you were unsure of your sexuality, and found out that you are actually straight, would you announce it? No. Why should it be any different for bisexuality? It's a preference of who you like. It doesn't affect any of them or their preferences, unless you have feelings for one of them. However, you didn't say that, so I'm gonna assume that that's not the case.If I were you, I'd simply end up with a girlfriend one way or another, and introduce her to them as such: ""Guys, this is my girlfriend ___"" (___ obviously being their name XD). Because, really, it's who you love. They should support you no matter what, and they also shouldn't be bothered by it as you'd be in a relationship, so it's not like they can assume you have feelings for them. Bisexual is just a label for you and others to understand what it is you 'prefer', but as long as you make it clear to your friends that just because you are capable of loving a female like that, doesn't mean you love EVERY female ever, and therefore you don't have feelings for them.Don't worry about it. It's just a label to explain who you are capable of loving. They'll later ask about your sexuality if you do follow my example with the girlfriend thing (I'm not even kidding, do it), but there's a chance they won't too. Besides, it'll probably just be; ""You didn't tell us you were lesbian!"" or ""Are you lesbian?? Why didn't you tell us?!"". Just explain to them that a) you're bisexual, not lesbian, and b) why should you have to make a big deal out of it? People always say it's not a big deal, so why make a big announcement of it? There's no point, that's just hypocritical really."

why do dreams look so real	if you dream about some kind of harm will there be injuries in real life	0	I’ve asked myself the same question plenty of times over and have recently been told that perhaps I lucid dream. I’m not sure if this fits exactly as with lucid dreaming a person has control over their dreams (I can control them at times but not all the time).Like you, even if I’m extremely tired, once I go to sleep my dreams are very vivid, somewhat highly imaginative and sometimes just bizzare. When I wake up I always remember my dreams and can recall them days, months and even years later. It’s a common thing between my friends and I for them to ask ‘what did you dream of yesterday’ as they always find is so fascinating due to not remembering their own dreams!This isn’t a new thing for me either. I’ve been like this since I was very young and growing up, used to frequently confuse dreams for reality. For example, around 8/9 I had a dream that I was driving an uncles car and had crashed it through a local supermarket window. I was convinced this had happened but my family just didn’t want to talk about it with me as every time I brought it up they’d say it was just a dream! Even to this day I still have to remind myself at times that it was actually just a dream (a long with other dreams of course!)Do you by any chance have (or have had) any mental health issues? The reason I ask is that I once suffered from severe social phobia and whilst seeking couselling discussed my very vivid dreams which I was told at the time is quite common amongst those with mental health issues.	"One thing to remember about stories you read about is that there are a lot of people who just make things up.  Some may be placebo effects (which are shockingly powerful), some may be coincidences, some may be lacking context or reading too much into things, but many personal anecdotes lies--pure and simple.  This is especially true with hearsay, where one person tells another person something, who tells someone else something, each person adding their own embellishments, until what gets to you has almost nothing to do with what even appeared to have happened.Since this is an A2A, I will assume that your story is not a lie.  There are nonetheless many possible causes.  I will list a few of them.  The probability of all possible causes should add up to 100%, so the longer the list, the less weight each possibility has.  The probability distribution, however, is not uniform.  Potential causes that conform with more of what one's general understanding of reality should be given more weight than those that contradict it:1) As you suggested, dreams cause reality.  Think about what this possibility implies, from the perspective of the child killer in your dream.  He (guessing at pronoun) did not know you were dreaming, and certainly did not know you were dreaming about having your blood drained.  He was simply going about his life, which just happened to involve the extremely unusual activity of draining people's blood (in addition to killing children, because he is apparently very busy), and decided to choose you of all people for whatever nefarious reasons--probably thought up long in advance and before you were asleep.  Your dream then reached back in time via some mechanism (psychic dream tendrils?), of yet undiscovered by science (and, if discovered, could some people very rich), took control of his brain, and made him drain your blood, all the while thinking it was his own idea.  This bizarre scenario goes sharply against almost everything I know about how the world works, so I would only consider it if every single alternative were conclusively disproven.  Probability share: very, very small.2) Reality causes dreams.  You were anemic for some pre-existing medical reason (might be worth looking into) and slept on your arm causing the pain and redness (or maybe that was related to the anemia, or a separate condition).  You felt the effects of the anemia and arm pain while you were asleep, so your subconscious generated a story to explain what it was experiencing.  Probability share: High.3) Placebo effect.  Your dream scared you, and suggested that your were lacking blood and might have pain in your arm, inducing a placebo reaction.  The effects of placebos are well-documented, common, and extremely powerful (they can literally kill you).  Probability share: High.4) Coincidence.  The dream was unusual, and so were the effects you felt when you woke up, so what are the odds of both of them happening at the same time?  Actually, higher than you might think, largely because you wouldn't be asking if you had a boring, forgettable, or nonsensical dream, or any dream followed by nothing interesting happening.  Probability share: Moderate to High.5) False Reading.  Your dream was of a child-killer stealing your blood.  You felt ill and had some arm pain.  These are not the same.  Did you find a syringe hole?  Are you sure the illness was actually caused by lost blood (did you measure how much blood you had before you went to sleep and after you woke up)?  Do you have any evidence at all that a person was near you when you were asleep?  Do you have any evidence at all this person, if they exist, has killed children?  If the answer to any or many of these is ""no"", then your dream was wrong and should count as evidence against dreams having any correlation with reality, not as evidence in favor.  Probability share: Not Applicable, but I include this answer because it may diminish the need for any explanation at all.6) Some other explanation I haven't thought of.  I like to think that, on a typical late night of binge-Quora writing, I can consider a question from all possible angles and give a 100% perfect and complete explanation.  Unfortunately, honesty and humility (those spoilsports!) force me to admit that there will always be an unknown amount of possibilites that I fail consider, no matter how hard I try.  Thus, there may be any number of explanations of your experience that command respectable probability shares that I have not included on the above list.  Collective Probability Share: Moderate to Very High.Summing up, if we were to draw all of the above explanations on a pie graph, I believe that 2, 3, 4, and 6 would each command large sections of the pie, which isn't very large to begin with because of 5, with 1 being a tiny crumb that fell out of the pan.  In other words, not very likely.The same reasoning could be applied to the anecdotes you read about, except that I would add possibility 7) they are lying, (""they"" referring to the individual, or to one or several of the people in the chain of reporting) which would take 75-90% of the pie in each case, with 2, 3, 4, and 6 again finishing off the remainder."
do cricket players really drink tea on a tea break	do cricketers actually drink tea during tea break	1	It has actually come from the old tradition where people used to drink tea more those days than the energy drinks or something.Generally tea break is just for relaxing after a session of play and discuss the plans for next session of play with their team and coach.

how can i get entry in mit	what are the requirements for selection into mit	1	I admitted the undergraduate students to MIT for 28 years, nearly 10 as Dean of Admissions.  It is very difficult to describe how one gets admitted because it is a subjective process based on a variety of factors.  But let me say that of all the answers below, Anonymous is closest to the truth.  Simply put, you need a 'hook', which means something so special that it is pretty rare.  (A hook is also known in the admissions business as an 'institutional need', something that the schools want but will never tell the public about.  Div 1 athletes, children of major donors or celebrities, best in state, best in nation, academic superstars, someone who is published in a major publication, etc are examples nationally.  MIT has its own institutional needs that their outstanding admissions office works hard to identify and admit.)  Note that this is not just high scores and perfect grades, as most people believe.  It's different.   As Anonymous says, for MIT  be world-class at something (accent on 'world class'), crush school (that's right - crush it, no excuses) and build writing and interpersonal skills so you can communicate effectively with others.  MIT people are action people so the admissions office is looking for people who regularly make things happen for themselves and others with great self-initiative.  A deeper than normal curiosity is critical because that screams MIT.  And a fearlessness is necessary because not only is MIT the most extraordinary university of its kind on Earth, it's also one of the most demanding.  (There's no place to hide in the curriculum there as one can in Ivy schools.)  Each of these attributes must be represented by actual evidence in the case.  But it's the hook that gets one admitted.If I could tell future applicants anything, it is to understand the culture of the individual school and see if you are a match.  For example, MIT is an action place and so is well suited for action-types and not really that suited for intellectual types.  Also, do not pick a college based on ranking.  That's just ignorance.  All ranking systems have been designed to sell products so they are neither neutral authorities nor really true. You must learn about schools yourself in this era of Big Spin.  That takes work. And most importantly, don't take advice about college admissions from anyone who has never admitted for a living.  Your friends and parents know nothing about such an arcane process and do what we all do - make assumptions about how it appears to work and then act on the assumptions they just made up as if they were true (a process I refer to as M.S.U. - making sh*t up).  That never ends well since it isn't based in truth.I hope this helps.

does a fetus breathe when it  inside a womb	how does a fetus exhale in the womb	1	What are the most persuasive arguments that abortion is murder? Please just answer the question or ignore it. If you have a comment that's not an answer to the exact question that was asked, post it in the comments section exclusively.	The answer to this question is simple: They don’t! Not even a tiny little bit!A fetus/baby in the womb. You can clearly see the umbilical cord connected to the placenta in the background.The fetus develops inside what is literally a sack of water inside the mother’s womb. It does not take a single breath until some time after it is born. The developing fetus/baby gets everything it needs to sustain its life and development through the Umbilical cord. This includes oxygen. The umbilical cord is in turn connected to the Placenta, which is where oxygen and nutrients are switched from the mother’s bloodstream to the fetus’/baby’s bloodstream. So, because of this the fetus/baby does not need to breathe or exhale.During a typical birth the baby comes out first, and then sometime later the placenta comes out. It can be as long as half an hour before the placenta comes out, and in un-normal cases it can be a lot longer. When the baby is first born, it is still connected to the placenta and the mother through the umbilical cord which is almost like a wire hanging out from the mother. As soon as the baby is out in air, it can start breathing using its lungs for the first time, but actually, as long as it has its umbilical cord and the placenta is still connected to the mother, it does not have to. For example Water birth has become much more normal, where the baby is actually born in water, not in air. As long as the umbilical cord is still intact and the placenta has not been birthed, the baby could actually quite happily stay submerged in water without breathing.A water birth where the father holds the placenta in a bowl while the umbilical cord is still attached.In the bad old days doctors and midwives were very keen to make the newborn baby breathe using its lungs as quickly as soon as possible, which is why they sometimes smacked the baby’s bottom to make it cry out. In modern medicine it is appreciated that the newborn baby can continue to use the umbilical cord for some time, and the baby is allowed to experience a more gentle adaptation to the outside world. It is also thought that leaving the umbilical cord attached for some time will allow the blood in there to be retracted into the baby’s main body with significant health benefits to the baby.So, in conclusion, fetus/baby does not breathe or exhale inside the womb. I added a little bit of extra info that I hope you enjoyed and found informative.

do you regret your divorce	have you ever regretted your divorce	1	I get asked a lot about this. I will speak only to my own regrets.We had a very loving relationship, particularly in the beginning.Things escalated fast, we went from long distance relationship to quickly living together, and soon there was pressure for us to get married. We eventually did and that added a type of pressure our relationship wasn’t quite ready for.In terms of regrets, there are a lot of things I would have done differently. As a young hard-headed man, and in the moment, I was blind to a lot of the issues that were afoot. And if I had a chief regret, it would be that I wish I’d been a more attentive husband.The worst part about the divorce is not necessarily the divorce itself, after all, no good marriage ends in divorce.The actual worst part is the descent from a loving relationship to an ugly place where people say and do a lot of things they regret. Things that cloud and pollute the good memories you had.By the time you get to the courtroom, the damage is usually done and the divorce is just a formality.	I’m writing this on Father’s Day. Yesterday, I drove 250 miles round trip to have dinner with my adult daughter who was working at her fun part time job after her first week at the full-time job that she got after graduating college and getting married. It’s a trip that I have made many times and we still communicate pretty much every day.I regret the emotional damage it did to my daughter. Although I tried everything to make sure she was emotionally protected, I simply couldn’t afford the endless litigation that my ex-wife brought to the table. Heck, my ex-wife once threatened my daughter that she would call her lawyer if my daughter she didn’t stop crying.Ok, a little background. When my daughter was young, it was a good day for her if she didn’t cry at school. She was always emotional but I always knew how to deal with her to calm her down. And it drove my ex-wife nuts our daughter would go to me when she was upset. My ex-wife was one of those mothers who would put the baby half way between the two of us just to see which parent she would crawl to first. The results were always the same and that made my ex-wife very angry. She once told me that she wanted another kid because maybe the next one would favor her and not me. The result of the divorce was my daughter spent years in therapy.Even though it has been well over a decade since the divorce, and we both have moved on and have remarried, I still get angry thinking about the amount that my daughter suffered. Over the past month, I got to spend 6 hours at my daughter’s graduation with my ex-wife and then the next week with all of the ex-family members who also hold an incredible grudge at me for fighting for my daughter. Great times. A divorce when there are kids involved means that there will be events that you will always have to be around them. And no matter how long it has been, there will still be issues.As for what I could have done to make a difference, I’m really not sure. Personally, I would have stuck it out in a marriage that wasn’t all that great if it would have helped my daughter but it wasn’t my choice in the matter. I’m much happier without her but it still makes me angry to know what my daughter went through.
how much does your dna change over time if i were to clone myself 70 years from now will the clone have the same hair color	how much can a person  dna change from birth to death in a life span of approximately 70 years	1	"From the point of view of a basic biological model, yes. However, as you go more into detail, there are plenty of exceptions that might be notable.Natural mutations can occur in cells of living organisms due to a variety of causes, and actually it does so quite often. We have a DNA repair mechanism, but sometimes it fails. Substances that may facilitate this are called carcinogenics, because an accumulation of natural mutations may lead cells to go haywire with uncontrolled replication (i.e. cancer). In addition, many cancers evolve mutations that increase mutability of their DNA.Germline cells create gametes by meiosis. These new cells are, of course, haploid and thus have ""different"" DNA. Not only that, but some epigenetic changes such as Genomic imprinting occur here.Immune cells that create antibodies. Each antibody binds highly specifically to a single antigen structure (epitope), at which point the antibody and its target are removed from the body by white blood cells. Because the body does not know in advance the structures of possible invading cells it needs to catch as many possible structures as possible -- around 10 billion different ones in humans.To achieve this, the immune cells that produce antibodies change their own DNA in the loci that contain the antibody genes. This way, each immune cell has its own signature antibody that it produces like a factory. When a target is actually found corresponding to an antibody, the unique cell that produces it is made to replicate and live longer, so that the recipe for that antibody may be remembered in case of future invasions. This is the principle that drives vaccination.Viruses introduce new DNA into a cell, and some can even insert themselves into their host's chromosomes, i.e. changing their DNA. This is called a provirus.Epigenetic changes do not pertain to the sequence but the structure of the DNA, which changes continually. An extreme and famous example is that of X-inactivation.Mosaics and chimeras are organisms composed of two or more populations of cells with different genomes, due to mutations or other changes early in the developmental state of the zygote. For example, some people have male and female cells in different parts of their bodies.I'm sure there are plenty more examples, but these are the ones that I come up with off the top of my head."

is it right to tell a girl the you have feelings for her	what are some cool facts about facebook	0	It is always right to be open and honest about your feelings, with one caveat:You have to think about the person you are talking to. Being open about your feelings always feels good, but if you are making someone uncomfortable, or jumping into something deep without an understanding about how that person feels, then it turns in to a selfish impulse.So it depends on your immediate circumstance. You know a girl, a friend, and think it’s time to try and take it to the next level? By all means, tell her that you are interested. Don’t say she has your undying love (just yet), even if you feel that way. :)If the girl is a stranger, don’t say anything at all until you know her better.Finally, after considering all the above, and don’t let a potential friendship or relationship die because you were a little too timid to make a move.Good luck!	"Once you post a status to Facebook, you are more or less hoping to receive interaction from others, right? It could be like clicking, commenting, or simply ... watching. And in order to attract these activities, in addition to good or right post content, there are a number of other factors that also contribute to how other people interact with the content you post to Facebook. A few interesting things that Facebook people sometimes don't know.1. Posts with photos that are liked more than 53%According to data from Kissmetric, posts with photos receive 53% more likes and 104% more comments than posts that are full of words. And if there is a link in that post, the number of users clicking on the link will be 84% higher than the traditional post posting. And of course, beautiful photos with profound content, self-explanatory ability are getting more and more interaction.Meanwhile, a survey by Wishpond Research said that the photo post will receive 120% more interaction than normal, and the photo album will receive 180% more interaction, a very impressive number. This means that if you have a lot of photos, you should put them in the same album, so it will attract more friends than posting them individually.2. Posts are liked and commented moreWriting short states is not just for Twitter but also for Facebook. If your article has less than 250 characters, you will get more than 60% of the maximum interaction, and if you drop it below 80 characters, this number will increase to 66%. You can also see this with adjusting yourself, that when you encounter too long posts on Facebook, we tend to ignore, especially if it doesn't relate to yourself. Therefore, keeping it short and concise is very important.3. Using emoticons will be 33% more commentsIf you think emoticons are only for teenagers, you may have to think again. According to AMEX OPEN Forum, a specialized place for entrepreneurs and entrepreneurs to share experiences with each other, the post-emoticon posts will be 33% more commented by others than traditional postings. And also with emoticons, you will get more than 33% share, 57% more likes. The reason for this is because emoticons contribute to making your post more friendly, and of course there is far more ""emotion"" than traditional dry characters.4. Posts on Thursdays and Fridays are more interactiveCompared to other days of the week, the BuddyMedia study shows that if you post status on Thursday and Friday, people will see, like or comment more than 18%. It's understandable, because these are the last two days of the weekend, and during that time people tend to go to Facebook more than work.The study also surveyed various fields, such as sports, retail, electronics, cars, health ... to see which days are most suitable for posting relevant status. Although the results vary slightly, the focus is mainly on Wednesday to Friday. Surely no one wants to post status on Monday and Tuesday.5. The post contains more than twice the comment questionQuestions are one of the most effective forms of interactivity. Kissmetric says that their question-based posts are 100% more commented by others, which is double, compared to a traditional text post. HubSpot research firm also came to the same conclusion, ie the comment into your state will increase, but clicking like and sharing will decrease compared to other types of content.You also need to know that the words you put into the question will also affect the interaction. HubSpot found that if your question contains ""so"", ""which"", ""who"", it will get more comments from others. For example, I posted a status like this: ""Have 100$, should take a girlfriend to eat tea or eat hotpot?"" then people will enter more comments, although this is a relatively ""closed"" question. With more ""open"" questions, such as ""why"", ""how"", people will be less interactive because it requires thinking before writing a comment.6. 35% of users click like a Page to participate in competitionsIf you have a Page of your own and want to attract more fans, organize a contest, because according to Buffer, 35% of Facebook users click like Page just to participate in the contest. A title contest for photos has also received 5.5 times more comments than regular posts. According to BuddyMedia's research, test-related words, such as ""winners"", ""wins"", ""participation"", ""competitions"", ""competitions"" will attract users to interact more.7. Most Facebook users use social networking support servicesBusiness or social networking users say that they feel social networking support services give a rather high profit performance, helping them save time and effort for the next. close to customers. Indeed, according to statistics from Sell Real Likes, a company that provides services to support likes, comments, followers on social networks, it is assumed that in 3 companies, 2 companies contacted them for cooperation and on average in 2018 the total number of people buying their services increased 5 times compared to 5 years ago.8. 42% of users click like Page to enjoy discounts and promotionsThis data is given by survey company Socially Stacked. According to the company Wildfire Interactive, the advertising campaign with coupons attracted people to interact more than the campaign gift or related campaign requires people to participate in the competition.Good luck!"
is donald trump taking cocaine as howard dean suggests	are there any strong indications that donald trump does cocaine	1	Howard Dean himself has said that he think it’s “unlikely” that Donald Trump is using cocaine, but that he can’t rule it out and that he’d like to know more.Howard Dean stands by Donald Trump cocaine tweetI saw Dean’s tweet when it went live during the debate, and while I think it far more likely that Trump has a sinus infection or some other minor cold that was making him snuffly, it is a fair point that Trump’s behavior is not inconsistent with someone who is routinely using stimulants such as cocaine.I personally don’t think Trump is using cocaine or other stimulants, but it’s not that far of a reach. And the weird nature of the medical releases made by the Trump campaign, and the candidate’s persistent claims to have “great stamina” (something which stimulants would make much easier to sustain) and the campaign’s constant attacks regarding his opponent’s health put his own health quite fairly into legitimate question.Instead, Trump’s campaign has taken the position that there were no sniffles; apparently, those weird snuffly noises we were hearing were caused by a “defective microphone”.

is it true that in order to be part of an elite or just rich and successful you have to join a secret organisation otherwise no chance at all	what is the syllabus for icse 2017 geography map	0	No. Set conspiracy aside, and even if your assumption was true, if you don’t have the skills and the capabilities, you can never become rich and successful. You might become rich by simply inheriting your relatives’ money, but by no means would that make you successful.If you are born into a rich family, then being rich is simply achieved by pure chance. This would only increase your odds of becoming successful, as you would have more resources than the average individual, but that would still not make you successful.Many “nobodies” became rich and successful because of their skills and capabilities.Examples include:Oprah WinfreyShahid KhanLarry EllisonJack Maetc…	Mountains:AravalisWestern GhatsEastern GhatsGaro HillsKhasi HillsJantia HillsThe Great HimalayasShiwaliksVindhyasSatpurasPlateaus:Malwa PlateauDeccan PlateauChhota Nagpur PlateauPasses:Karakoram PassNathula PassCities:SrinagarDelhiAllahabadMumbaiCochinChennaiHyderabadVisakhapatnamKolkataBengaluruA coal fieldAn iron ore fieldAn off shore oil fieldAn on shore oil fieldRivers:IndusJhelumChenabRaviBeasSatlujGangaYamunaGomtiGhaghraGandakKosiChambalBetwaSonDamodarBrahmaputraNarmadaTaptiMahanadiGodavariKrishnaTungabhadraKaveriCoasts:Konkan...
which is more financially beneficial being in a firm or teaching in an architecture college	why might career training programs be more beneficial than a college degree if at all to aspiring entrepreneurs and tycoons	0	It depends on you if you want to be on top of your game be in the firm or if you want to play at a safer side stable job then work as a internal recruiter.The answer could be more detailed depends on the more detailed question and background.Make Sure To Follow My YouTube Channel Blog : TheStaffingCircle | HR | Staffing | Technology | Sales & Business Development | CV & Resume | Career Management | Job Search & More.	Bzzt! Wrong assumption. About 70 percent of the adults in the USA don’t have college degrees. There are 18.5 million white blue collar production workers and 14 million white service workers. If you put them together with their white spouses, that’s only about 40 percent of the people in the USA who don’t have college degrees. So these are the “people without highly p;aid jobs” referred to here.A majority of working class people in the USA don’t vote at all. And thus they don’t vote for Republicans.But there’s another major group of people without college degrees: Small business owners. There are 17 million of them and they are 86 percent white — much whiter (86 percent white) as a group than manual and service workers. Moreover they vote more regularly than the working class does and they tend to be predominantly Republicans (78 percent say they are conservative on economic issues). And their average income is $102,000 a year — so they are not low paid. We could add in real estate agents and brokers into this list.There are also 1.8 million managers, 8.8 million supervisors, and 1.6 million cops whose jobs don’t require a college degree. Some may have a degree, but it is clear that there are tens of millions of non-working-class people in the United States who lack such a degree.If we add in their white spouses, you can account for all of the 29 million people without college degrees who voted for Trump in 2016.It’s been true for decades that a sizeable minority of union members vote for Republicans. But the more affluent small business and supervisorial-bureaucratic classes are really much more of a major base for the Republicans. This also explains why the average income of Republican voters is higher than Democrat voters.

why is sandeep maheshwari not on quora	who is sandeep maheshwari	0	I am a employee at a small startup, I leave home at 8 am in the morning, work my ass-off for the next 9 hours, travel 1:30 hours back home. I reach home at 8 Pm in evening, and to be honest I am so tired by the end of the day that after having food I directly jump on the bed.So a just another guy like me has barely any time for using any social network, think about a CEO of the company who has to be workaholic and round the clock available whenever he is needed because a lot is on stake i.e his company, his employees and finally his reputation of delivering the best to the clients.This is the reason why guys like Sandeep sir are not on this wonderful platform, not only Quora he is not on any of the social network even if he is, the account is managed by his PR team.Also one takes out time from his busy schedule for leisure, again people like Sandeep sir prefer to gain more knowledge by involving themselves in reading books, spending with family.Also Quora as a platform is too demanding, you have to write the answers in a way that it satisfies the asker, and for that the answer has to be lengthy so that each and every aspect is understood perfectly.

how can i convince people to stop blaspheming against the holy spirit	does it matter from which college you do your graduation bcom from for admission into a top indian bschool even if i score high99 percent 	0	There are as many different ways to worship and blaspheme the holy spirit as there are people on this planet. Each has their own way (or not) of communicating to the divine. So how you perceive blasphemy is not how others see it and you will never convince another to do different than they do.In any way which include connecting/talking to god or not our god does not judge us for the little things, and words of blasphemy is a small thing. Jesus said turn the other cheek.We can only change ourself and how we feel about another not change that person, so don’t even try. Even god doesn’t try to change us, he ever patiently waits for us to change ourselves.	Original question: Does your graduation score matter during MBA.If you are aiming for iBank and Top consulting companies, yes your graduation college and marks matter a lot.Yes it does. Almost all colleges allocate certain points to your graduation marks. So another person with a similar cv but higher graduation marks from a better college has a better chance.Your marks will also matter during your final MBA placements. So whoever said marks don't matter was either lying or did not know anything about India education system.
why can not i stop watching porn	why should  should not  i watch porn	0	Why can't I seem to stop watching porn and masturbating? I think I'm under control and the next thing I know, I find myself doing it.	I guess the question itself is the origin of dilemma... Rather you should be asking yourself why do I want to watch it. Porn is all about unrealistic behaviour. The characters involved are not lovers but they are actors. Porn is all about humiliation of women and dominance of men. It is a major cause of human trafficking. Can make you addicted as of dopamine secretion. Physiologically affects you giving a fake image of sex. Reproduction is a necessary life process but it make you sick if it gets over your mind. I myself was an addict for 3 consecutive years and that's why I strictly advice you not to watch it. Porn isn't natural. Though masturbation is natural (though I won't recommend that also) and normal but over doing it oftenly comes along watching porn which makes it bad for health and a major factor of times waste. AVOID PORN
how can i start trusting any one	how can one learn to trust again	0	this is a gut instinct.if one helps you somehow, this means that he is doing something for you. you should trust him because not everyone can do this for you.	That is hard. Really hard! And the difficulty to start trusting again gets bigger according to how much you had trusted that person before and how that person broke your trust.I think, that person is the one who should prove himself/herself again for you to start trusting that person again, because it is that person’s fault that the trust was broken (unless it was a misunderstanding between you two).Starting to trust a person again who broke your trust is a scary thing, unless that person IS REALLY now a trustworthy person and has repented for breaking your trust and has been working hard to prove that the person is trust worthy.But, I must say, in case you have lost trust in all other people around you because of that one person who has broken your trust, then you must understand that not everybody is the same and really kind and nice people (like me ;p) still exist in this world. Do not lose hope. Basic trust among us humans is what that keeps the world still going and helps to maintain harmony (at least a bit). But, it is not easy to find such good people. So you must take your safety measures. Trust people around you to some extent, but don’t trust them fully. Be alert and aware of what is happening around you. Only time can answer if all the people around you are really good people.Finally, let’s stay good in heart and be a human. Cheers!

how did you first come across porn	how were you first introduced to porn	1	Like Daniel Boorstin, 'I write to discover what I think'.I prefer show to tell. My answers share some of my interests, knowledge and quirks. A quote by Arthur Raymond Marshall explains the underlyi...	When I was about 8 or 9, my parents bought me an iPad so I could play games and watch videos without me bothering them. When I was around 12, I was looking through the internet, and one way or another, I came across porn for the first time. I was interested and going through puberty like any other boy my age would be, and I watched more and more of it as time went on.As someone who’s growing up in an extremely Christian household, my parents were very strict about things. I didn’t get my phone until I turned 13, and I’m denied any kind of social media until I’m 18. I’ve never had a sleepover before, which I think of as a crucial part of growing up. I’ve never had a girl over at my house, and have never hung out with a girl outside of school. I didn’t watch much TV growing up; I never really watched Disney channel, and I’ve never seen a full episode of spongebob to this day. My parents are very homophobic, so I’m denied being friends with or hanging out with anybody they consider “too gay for their household”. All this, leading up to my porn habits, eventually lead to my mom searching through my iPad and finding my search history.She was hysterical. She yelled at me, beat me with a belt, and overall threw about every insult she could think of at me. She immediately told my dad, who proceeded to do the same to me. Long story short, I wasn’t allowed to use my iPad for a good few months or so, and my parents installed an app on my iPad and phone that lets them track my search history and screen time, as well as disable my phone at any time they wanted.I’m 13 now, and my parents haven’t gotten any more lenient. I’m often downplayed for being known as the kid who’s never really done much, and it’s taken a toll on my self-esteem and social life.All that being said, if I had a daughter that was watching porn, I would sit down and have a conversation with her. I’d ask her why she was doing so, who or what introduced her into it, and inform her of the dangers of watching porn and what it could do to her and her health. One thing I wouldn’t do, though, is punish her. Being introduced to and watching porn it’s something that every child goes through in their lives at one point or another.You can’t take complete control of what your child is exposed to on the internet, only how they react to it and what they know it could do to them.
which car services are available in normal il how good are they compared to taxis and relative to each other	which car services are available in atlanta how good are they compared to taxis and relative to each other	0	Currently Uber is the only ride share operating in Springfield, but Lyft will be here in a week or so. From what I have heard, Lyft has a much more rigorous “interview” portion for new drivers, so their drivers are probably a little better than Uber, but most Uber drivers are excellent.The taxi providers here absolutely blow. They charge an arm and a leg compared to Uber and the vehicle are usually run down, with driver’s who are late, even you called them 2 hours in advance of when you need them. If you go with Uber, you better not request that ride until you’re ready to go! The most you will wait is 10–15 minutes, but usually it’s less than 5.Also, taxi services are a cash only business. Uber is totally cash-less. Me being a person who doesn't carry cash, Uber is my speed. Lyft, being an online ride share app as well, is also cash-less.	Both Uber and Lyft have a large presence in Atlanta. I believe there are a couple other small startups trying to get into that space but they don’t have much of the market and I have never tried them. I've tried both Uber and Lyft and settled on using Uber early on. I found that I felt Uber was a little more professional than Lyft, but that was a few years ago. You can't really go wrong with either.Both are far and away better than taxis in a city like Atlanta. Atlanta isn't the type of city where you can just step to the curb and hail a cab like New York is. Aside from a select few places around Atlanta, like MARTA stations or the airport, you have to call the taxi company to hail a cab. Opening up my phone and pressing a few buttons is just way too convenient and I generally feel safer when taking an Uber or Lyft. I've also found that car sharing services are a lot more consistent than taxis in Atlanta in terms of quality of service.TL;DR You can't really go wrong with Uber or Lyft, but both are far better and far more convenient than taxis in Atlanta.
why can nonascii t charged molecules pass through the lipid cell membrane	why can not sodium channels pass through potassium channels	0	It is a problem of free energy. The charged molecule (depending on polarity) prefers to interact with the polar/charged heads of the membrane (the outside). The inside is non-polar/hydrophobic. The de-solvation barrier of the molecule in question alone is enough to prevent its passive diffusion through. Otherwise, the molecule would have to physically change the permittivity of the membrane to enter the hydrophobic part.Some charged molecules/ions (e.g. chaotropes) can actually adsorb and change the permittivity of the charged membrane. They become more permeable to water, and maybe this will cause leakage. But in general, thermodynamically, diffusion of polar and charged molecules is not favorable, at least in a kinetic time-scale that matters.	Why doesn't the resting membrane potential become more and more negative? Potassium leak channels are more permeable than sodium channels, so more potassium will leak out than sodium leaking in. How does the resting membrane potential stay at -70mV?
how does it feel to be a spouse of a renowned porn star	how can i get rid of the feeling that my spouse is cheating on me	0	Being in a polygamous relationship is nice once you finally decide to try it and let go of what it means to be monogamous, which means to somewhat force yourself to only love that one person.A polygamous relationship gives you a lot of freedom and is very healthy as long as everybody involved is happy with the situation. Not everybody in a polygamous relationship are the same, and not all said relationships are the same either.Some people are in a polygamous relationship with people who also have multiple partners ( IE: 1 guy can have 3 girlfriends, and each of those girlfriends might have 2 boyfriends each )But some relationships ( like mine ) are some where a select number of guys/girls are in a relationship with one person. I have three boyfriends who all love me and I love them all as well. Two of them are twin brothers and the other is a good friend of theirs. They apparently all fell in love with me because I was one of the few girls who was nice to them, and eventually we ended up in a four way relationship and we are still very happy today ( Started the relationship when I was fifteen. Currently 19 )We made sure to keep it secret from the public, since it isn’t seen very well by many cultures. But if you’re willing to give up the pride of letting everyone know you’re in love with someone, or many someones in this case, it’s definitely worth while. You feel a lot safer when you have more partners, and the guys don’t mind sharing me at all, which is a big thing. You don’t want anyone in the relationship to be jealous, otherwise it can ruin it for everyone.When it comes to sex, there are many avenues you can take: Sex with one at a time, or sex with multiple/all partners at the same time. This is something that can also be helpful, as if one person doesn’t quite feel like sex, you have others that you love that might be in the mood. If everyone is in the mood you can try group sex, which is an amazing experience on its own.Overall I recommend it. If you can manage to forget the words of the many that judge you for what you decided to do with your own love life, it’s a wonderful experience that should never be completely dismissed!	Don't accuse your spouse of cheating unless you have solid proof. Just ask your spouse calmly “have they ever cheated or thought of cheating “ . prepare your self for the one answer you don't want to hear.If they say yes … your marriage is on trouble suggest consouling if that's what you BOTH want.If the answer is no…. Discuss why you asked the question . Explain the events leading up to your suspicions. Your partner may unknowingly have sent the wrong message to you. Then apologize for thinking the worst.Married couples assume to much. The reality is.. Neither are mindreaders. The key to a good marriage is communication and trust and respect for each other.Good luck hope it all works out for you and I've helped you a little.

Its outstanding nutritional profile, high protein and low calorie count makes it a ‘superfood’.Centuries ago, the Aztecs and the Mayas realised the healing properties of spirulina and enjoyed this source of vegetable nutrition as a ‘power-food’ to boost their energy levels and enhance stamina.Recent scientific research has revealed numerous health benefits of this ‘super-food’. Spirulina has been shown to help regulate blood sugar, blood pressure and cholesterol, alleviate pain, inflammation and allergies, balance the immune system, improve digestion by increasing good gut flora and deliver antioxidant activity to protect from life-threatening diseases like cancer, Alzheimers and strokes.It has also been shown to suppress appetite and help weight watchers. Its high beta-carotene content helps maintain good skin and hair.A study conducted at the JC Bose Institute of Life Sciences, Bundelkhand University, Jhansi, published in ‘Current Pharmaceutical Biotechnology’ in 2005, reported that spirulina improves the activity of white blood cells, stimulates antibodies and increases the population of natural killer cells.Spirulina’s concentrated nutrition makes it an ideal food supplement for people of all ages and lifestyles, fussy eaters and especially those who do not manage to eat adequate amount of vegetables. However, pregnant and lactating women and people allergic to seafood or seaweed must consult their physician.Tropical weather, strong sunshine, pure water resource and pollution-free environment is all what Spirulina needs for its cultivation. However, if water is polluted or contaminated with heavy metals, it is not suitable for spirulina cultivation as these metals and toxins will get highly concentrated in spirulina and make it unsuitable for human consumption. Hence, the source and purity of spirulina is critical.Commercially, Spirulina is available in the form of powder, tablet, capsule and health tonic. It can be added to soups, pastas, fruits, vegetables, salads, pulses and lentils. Being high on nutrition and easy on digestion, it certainly is a good addition to our daily diet.

what would hillary clinton do now that the election is over	what will hillary clinton do now	1	What I hope she’ll do:Take a week off and go wherever she wants.Divorce Bill so he can spend his time with any young lady he wants and so she can get her own young, handsome poolboy.Staying on excellent terms with Bill, immerse herself at the Clinton Foundation and raise boatloads of money. The Clinton Foundation will want to increase focus on domestic beneficiaries to pick up where a GOP-held federal government will fail American citizens.Write books and give speeches to earn even more dough. She’s earned it.Be a behind-the-scenes adviser to a new, resolved, and massive progressive movement.Hop onto the public stage whenever to benefit anyone with a dream of making the world a great place for all.Email whoever the hell she wants whatever she wants.What she’ll do:Take a short amount of time of.Say some words to help heal the divide before the Trump presidency.Do a proper job closing up shop on her campaign.Help the DNC and other future Democrat leaders and wanna-be leaders learn from the campaign.Stick with Bill (I do believe they are truly in love with each other, but can still get annoyed with each other at times).Dive head first into the Clinton Foundation. Raise boatloads of money for foreign and domestic beneficiaries.Write books. Give speeches.Start a small but prestigious consulting gig.Hop onto the public stage when needed by progressive causes.Email whoever the hell she wants whatever she wants.Remember, she’s an incredibly accomplished, intelligent, and qualified person. She has admirers probably numbering in the hundreds of millions (internationally). She has earned and deserves any position she wants. I hope she enjoys whatever she decides to do and know that she won’t be the one pilloried in the White House.	Considering that she is now 69 years old and will be 73 when the next election cycle rolls around, and she has zero prospects for being appointed to any office in the Trump Administration (except maybe head of a federal prison work crew), I would say her political career is likely over.Even if she remains in good health, I can’t imagine her winning the nomination again in 2020. We saw on Tuesday just how unpopular she is. Even taking into account all of the people who were just fed-up and voted for Trump because he was an outsider, do you think for one second that if Barack Obama were eligible to run for a third term and had been facing Trump, that he wouldn’t have won?This was her last chance to be President. But look out for Michelle Obama’s upcoming attempt to become the first female President in the country’s history…

how i start prepare for ugc net english literature latest syllabus	how do i prepare for net jrf in english literature	1	The syllabus for UGC NET English is extremely vast, but unfortunately there is no shortcut-it is a continuous process, there is no point starting a month before the test and thinking you’re going to clear it. You need to strictly dedicate a certain amount of time every day for the preparation; make it part of our routine. Firstly, one has to be thorough with one's MA coursework. Get a general idea about all literary periods (right from Chaucer to the postmodern/contemporary), major authors and their works.Make sure to have read a standard history of British literature book- A Critical History of English Literature by David Daiches, History of English Literature by Edward Albert, An Outline History of English Literature by W H Hudson are some of the affordable choices. Also read Beginning Theory by Peter Barry. While you are reading through these, make sure to collect as much info as possible about each important author/critic and works mentioned in it. You could use the Oxford Companion to English Literature for this. It is a costly book to buy, but most libraries will have a copy in their reference section. Or you could buy the Concise version which is affordable and supplement it with info you collect from the web and the library. Reading entries from the Oxford companion (the latest edition is better as it will be the most updated) daily will help us to learn about works and authors from other literatures like American literature, Post-colonial literatures, world literatures in English etc that you won't find in the British literature history texts.Another important step is to be thorough with terms from M H Abrams' Glossary of Literary Terms. You need to make sure to have studied at least one or two entries from the Glossary daily.Also stay updated on contemporary developments in the field of literature especially the important literary awards like the Booker Prize, Pulitzer Prize, Nobel Prize etc.Maintaining a healthy reading habit is also important. Also solve previous question papers to get an idea about the kind of questions asked.An important step: Do not ignore Paper I as many people tend to do, because it is easy to score marks in this paper, which will help in increasing your average percentage, and thereby the chances of making the cut-off. You may buy any good guide for Paper I available in the market and practice as many sample questions as possible.While the NET is a hard nut to crack, with timely and systematic preparation, it is doable. Simply solving previous question papers is not enough, you need to develop good knowledge of your subject. Combined study is a good idea if you have friends who are also preparing for the same. All the best! :)	The syllabus for UGC NET English is extremely vast, but unfortunately there is no shortcut-it is a continuous process, there is no point starting a month before the test and thinking you’re going to clear it.

how did early europeans get protein before the columbian exchange	how did they say breakfast in portuguese before coffee was introduced to europeans  and  the portuguese language	0	The European diet was heavy on grains (minus maize, of course), heavy on the brassicas like cabbage, and used Old World spices like black pepper and cinnamon, cloves, grains of paradise, etc.There was, of course, much greater regional variety. While Italy may have been growing rice, wheat, and barely, northern European countries were eating oats and rye in greater quantities than they do now.Thee was no Turkey, but there were Guinea Fowl brought up from Africa. Game was important as long as forests existed. Fish was big along the coasts and rivers, and drying, salting, or smoking them made them available inland.Cows and their milk (and the cheeses made from them) were important dietary items, but so too were sheep and (regionally) goats.  In fact, if you just take away the New World foods from today's diet and you pretty much have what they were eating then. Northern Italian, Swiss, Eastern European, and Scandinavian diets of today are quite close to their historic forebears'.	In Portugal we don’t say café da manhã. Our word for breakfast is pequeno almoço, which literally translates as “little lunch”. I have never heard any Portuguese saying café da manhã, ever.So how was it called?Either pequeno almoço or desjejum.

is alex jones a satirical show	how is the canterbury tales a satire	0	A2A. I don't follow his shows, nor am I a fan, but I have watched a few of his clips back in my video watching days...One thing is for sure... it's not satirical, nor is it intended to be...Much of what Alex says is spot on... and there is method behind his madness... so to speak...He is undoubtedly an Illuminati front man... Its too much for me to get into all the nitty gritty, but the nutcase persona he portrays is very much intended. And it's accomplishing exactly what it was intended to...This question as to whether his show is satirical is proof of my statement above...He is actually exposing the agenda... in a way they want it to be exposed... So by people thinking of him as some nutcase, it destroys the credibility of all his assertions, and that's exactly what they want... The conspiracy is too vast, too encompassing, to keep completely under wraps. So they have their stooges, like Alex, to tell you versions of the conspiracy they want you to hear... Its like the Harry Potter series... by making it all seem like kiddies fiction, you would never think that magic and all this witchcraft stuff is actually quite real... so if you are ever confronted with such, you'll just shrug it off as some fantastical load of fiction, when it is actually quite real, and quite rife...These guys are smarter than anyone thinks... they know exactly what they're doing... and guess what?Its working like a charm...	Satire is the use of humor to expose someone or something's vices or flaws. In The Canterbury Tales, Geoffrey Chaucer uses satire to expose the faults of institutions, and common stereotypes of  his time. Satire is broken into six elements, all of which are prevalent in the tales.1. Verbal Irony - to say one thing and mean something else2. Mockery - to make something the laughing matter3. Understatement - implying the opposite something by saying less than one means4. Overstatement - implying something by exaggeration5. Parody - a mocking imitation6. Sarcasm - the use of praise to mock someoneEven in the General Prologue, the reader is exposed to Chaucer's satiric tone. This is especially true when he introduces to us the characters. For example, The Knight's  description is understatement. He is meant to poke fun at the Knights's of Chaucer's time that no longer followed the Code of Chivalry. Usually, the more Chaucer dislikes a character the more prevalent satire is in their description. An example of this is the Pardoner, his horrible description is overstatement to show what a horrible person he is. Also the animalistic description of him is a parody for the same purpose. Corruption of the Catholic Church was a major problem during Chaucer's time and, is a major theme in The Canterbury Tales. Through the use of satire, he exposes this issue to the audience. A major example of this is the overstatement of how bad the religious figures. The only moral religious figure, the parson, is a understatement whose pure lifestyle is meant to exemplify the adulterated lifestyles of the other clergy members. Hope this helped!!!!
should i learn angularjs  87  instead of angularjs 2 if i do not  know typescript	which should i start with angular 2 or angularjs 1	0	Unfortunately Angular 2 is pushing users very hard to use TypeScript instead of Babel, but this should not be an obstacle for learning the framework as TypeScript is very easy to pick up if you're competent with JavaScript.I love JavaScript, but I'm a also a huge fan TypeScript. I think it's absolutely the way to go if you're looking for either an improved tooling, value static analysis, or are simply looking for a reliable, high-quality ECMAScript transpiler.Having said having said that, as appropriate TypeScript you may wonder why I consider Angular 2’s push toward TypeScript unfortunate. The primary reason is that Angular 2 uses TypeScript in a very awkward, non idiomatic, and frankly confusing and off-putting way. It's a terrible introduction to the language that will confuse just about anyone because what the end of their team wanted was a language with reified types and TypeScript is not that language. All of the types in TypeScript code exist for static analysis, tooling, and static code verification. They are by design completely erased from the emitted JavaScript. One very big caveat to this is classes which JavaScript programmers tend to think of it types but are actually values. Since TypeScript models class-based programming patterns, to a degree, it can be confusing to distinguish between the runtime and compile time nature of a class in TypeScript. Angular 2 complete these things with reckless abandon and to the detriment of its users and itself. It tries to pretend the TypeScript and by extension JavaScript are different languages than they actually are, trying to see them as more like Java, but this is not a viable way of coding. Typescript get this right, it tries to model JavaScript with types that match the way the language behaviors and is used, and stays true to its dynamic nature.Definitely learn TypeScript it's well worth it, but learn JavaScript first. If you learn typescript by way of Angular 2 you will likely end up with a distorted view of the language. For example of one of TypeScript's main purposes is to provide tooling and static checking but Angular 2’s APIs are loosely typed to the point of almost an almost 100% negating this benefit.It's also it's also worth mentioning that it's very pleasant and productive using AngularJS 1.5 with TypeScript.	Hi Friend ,It had been Great to learn AngularJS/ReactJS,As they are trending Now.Learning Angular 1 and Angular 2 are mostly different.About Angular 1:Angular is a JS framework released in 2009 and it is manly used for Creating dynamic,mostly SPA pages in web.As Angular is developed by google Team and it follows MVC ,so it became popular within less time and usage of Angular increases gradually.As Angular 1 follows only MVC but it lags in mobile support a little .After many years of research google team decided to extend Angular so that it will much faster and mobile supportive as well.About Angular 2:If any one is newbie and interested to learn Angular ,then better to start with Angular 2.Angular 2 is built around the concept of components, and more precisely, with the Web Components standard in mind.It was rewritten from scratch by the Angular team using Typescript (although you can use it with ES5, ES6, or Dart as well).Quick start if you already aware of NodeJS at Angular website.Learning Angular Made you to stand on top in many aspects.Now Google Team is gearing up Angular 2 as well they are releasing new angular version for every six months.More over Angular 3 is not released(Due to some issues with dependency with Angular 2 and they are working to fix) and Angular 4 is going to spin up soon.ReactJS:If you already have some knowledge in NodeJS and Java-script then you can start with ReactJS.ReactJS is much easier and simpler than AngularJS .It is released March 2013 as after Angular 1 is much popular and after few months ReactJS become big competitor to Angular as it is developed and used on using NodeJS concepts(On top of NodeJS).The main disadvantage with react is it only responsible for View, it will not have Controller and Model.This is used in Facebook, Atlassian | Software Development and Collaboration Tools,Dropbox,Flip-kart,Instagram …,etcIt’s main advantage is Virtual DOM, it makes the high performance for the page.Conclusion:If you are a beginner who don’t know java-script then learn it and then get some basic idea on NodeJS and then learn Angular 2 or ReactJS.As of now many projects in production are working with Angular 1 but soon after few months Angular team is going to stop support for Angular 1.As well most of the companies are using ReactJS in their projects.It is Upto You to choose Angular or React ,as Both are more popular and are using drastically in production.The google people are going to release angular version after every 6 months and react also recently updated it’s version i.e 16.0 alpha but stable version is 15.5 as well angular 4 is going to spinup soon in production as there is no angular 3.Note : The future of front end is angular and React.Image Source : GoogleHappy Coding …………………..
why can not we fall asleep on some days	why do we fall asleep	0	"I used to have this problem.  As a teenager, I would stay up until 4 in the morning playing World of Warcraft, crawl into bed, and still not be able to fall asleep.  It was terrible.A bunch of doctors suggested medication and/or sleeping pills.  I was never one for that sort of ""answer,"" so I chose insomnia instead.It wasn't until a few years ago that I started meditating, and I was finally able to fall asleep.  Now, I lie down and am asleep within 30 seconds, and I don't wake up until my alarm goes off.This is something that takes practice, but too many people mistake their busy thoughts as ""themselves,"" and either accept insomnia or resort to sleeping pills—neither of which are very desirable, in my opinion.  We all need sleep!  To meditate, simply sit in a comfortable, upright position (I usually sit on the floor with my back against a wall.  Comfortable enough, but not so comfortable as a chair that I'll fall asleep).  Close your eyes, place your hands on your knees (palms up if you want to feel more buddha, palms down if you're still that ""this shit doesn't work"" phase),  and breathe deeply.  You will hear your thoughts very loudly.  Don't tell them to shut up—this will only make them louder.  Instead, just listen.  Breathe and listen.  Stay there for at least five minutes.  Shoot for ten.  Fifteen and you get a gold star.Do this every day for six months and let me know what happens.  My guess: sleep."	John Medina, in his book Brain Rules, introduces data that forms the following graph:The data shows that student attention level takes a dive, approximately 10 minutes into a lesson.  This is a natural occurrence (and I believe the reason YouTube videos were initially limited to <9 minutes), but can be dealt with by a good instructor.  The problem is most instructors (particularly at the university level) know next to nothing about the learning process and instructional theory.  A good instructor will introduce variation into a lesson every 10 minutes to regain the students' attention (as depicted in the below graph).This variation can be accomplished in many ways - from inserting a student activity to asking questions or otherwise soliciting involvement from the students to changing the delivery style or mechanism.The problem is that so many instructors see instructing as a one-way communication.  If a student is not contributing to the communication, they lose focus and many literally go to sleep.There are other triggers for sleeping during lessons, such as eating a large meal immediately before the lesson, poor ventilation in the classroom, and tired students.
what are your views on modi governments decision to demonetize 500 and 1000 rupee notes how will this affect economy	what are your views on ban of 500 and 1000 rupee notes in india	1	Withdrawing high denomination currency notes [demonetization] has been done before [1946, 1978]. However, I believe the present move [2016] might have a bigger impact than the one done by British India and Morarji Desai. This is a move I have been dreaming for years and glad that it was done.The fact that the government was able to do this so secretly in such a connected manner speaks volumes. Indira Gandhi tried this in early 1970s, but could not as the move leaked out and the bad guys quickly changed over the notes. The government had to back out of the move then. I’m even thinking if the move to ban NDTV was just a ploy to distract the whole media, to pull this off. And it was possibly scheduled on US election day likely to get the global media off the heat and attention, as foreign media has been ultracritical & condescending of any major move in India.There are 5 key incentives for this:Bringing out illicit money sloshed stashed in the parallel economyHaving a lid on the fake money racket supported by our western neighborIncentivizing India to go cashless. The banks would not hand you wads of the new cash, but will just credit the money to your bank account in place of your old currency.Moving the notes to a more secure standard - with better protection against counterfeiting.Curbing inflation in real estate and reducing gold imports.As the 6th incentive, it would impact coalitions ahead of the major elections in UP and Punjab. It is not shocking that elections, especially in these states with multidimensional politics [a lot of parties fighting] involve a lot of illicit money. MLAs get traded like horses - with suitcases of cash. Some of that trading will get impacted.Unlike in the past, I don’t see much impact on normal users of currency. The transactions that happen on Rs. 500 and Rs. 1000 should be moving to netbanking/cheque/cards anyway. If someone is still holding out against modern transaction methods, this is the opportunity to come out from under the rock.For the poor who don’t have debit/credit cards, there might not be much impact either - as most of their transaction happen under Rs. 500.Impact of the move1. Black Money & corruption: The impact on black money usage will be temporary as those would eventually move to the new Rs. 2000 notes in time. Also, a lot of the black money lies in real estate, gold and other physical things. Still even a temporary, small impact on this sector is better than nothing. The mere fear of government taking out your black money is good enough. That the government could so secretly do this will increase the fear.2. Elections: Especially with the major elections barely weeks away, the move would impact politics in the crucial states. My guess is that the government waited for the Diwali to pass [will be a huge pain for many to have this move before the festival] and do it reasonably before the elections [EC could throw a spanner on any major move just before the elections]. Thus, unlike the previous occasions, the government didn’t do this on January 16. It could have impact on corruption in those elections and it is a way of the government saying, “Maha Gathbandhan, Check”.3. Counterfeiting: The impact on the counterfeit notes would be more significant. Many “dealers” with the existing counterfeit notes would be stuck as they would have to take the notes to the bank and have better chances of getting their racket exposed. Thus, they are more likely to destroy their notes and incur losses. Losses to the bad guys is good and maybe some of them could get shot unable to pay their debts. It would be quite hard to counterfeit the new currency and until they develop the technology for that, there will be an impact on counterfeit notes and terrorism that is funded through that.4. Cashless society. All of the above things are temporary things. But, I believe the long lasting one could be in moving cashless. The pain of transferring cash could incentivize many to think about going bits and plastic. Today could be a day to introspect for the legal users of the currency. That could have a more significant impact on counterfeiting and unaccounted money.5. Gold/silver. In the short term, gold and silver buying will be hampered, as a lot of the buyers buy with their black money. That means less importing. Over the long term, there might be more purchase of gold as the black money guys will be afraid to hold too much cash.6. Real Estate. In the short term, prices of real estate would come down for the same reason above. There will be less suitcases moving. It is not clear what would happen to this sector in the long term. Maybe there could be a little more land buying, but that could be neutralized by the spiraling down of the prices that could go now.7. Markets. This is overall a positive move that is lauded by a lot of people and could bring more confidence in Indian markets by overseas investors. However, the exit of black money temporarily could cause other repercussions in buying. I would not be surprised if the market goes a bit down in the short and medium term.8. Overseas Indians. There is a lot of INR that gets transacted outside of India. Technically it is illegal [NRIs, foreigners can’t leave with rupee], but there are not many practical alternatives. They would be impacted as they cannot change the money to the new notes quickly and those overseas currency trading markets on rupee would be impacted [UAE money exchanges won’t accept notes in India recall]. Some of these transactions are good ones that improve the economy, while others might help Dawood bhai like ones.9. Banking to all. The government’s key objective is to bring banking to all and this will help that. If you have more than Rs. 4000, the bank will not give you new notes, but will just ask you to open an account and credit it there. This when followed with the fees on ATM transactions will make it harder to transact on cash.10. Consumption and economy. This is one thing I believe it is going to be negative. Black money drives a lot of the economy and now that it is gone, it will impact consumption levels. There could be a deflation and damp economic growth for a couple of quarters. In the long run it doesn’t matter though.Think about this. India’s total tangible wealth is of the order of 280 lakh crores. World bank estimates at least a quarter of this is black. That means 70 lakh crores. It is possible that 10% of it is in cash, with the rest in real estate and gold. That is 7 lakh crores of black cash that is lying around. Maybe 80% of it will turn white and even with that Rs 1.4 lakh crores of black will be gone. That is big.The government gave the black money holders enough time [until Sept 30] to come clean [Black money: Rs. 65,250 crore disclosed under Income Declaration Scheme] and following up on its warnings would make them take the government seriously in this aspect.On the whole, the government has announced that it is alive and bold. At a time it looked like the government was sagging and losing speed, it is a time to reinvigorate.	What do you think of the decision by the Indian Government to demonetize 500 and 1000 rupee notes? Do you think it will it help in curbing black money and corruption?

why is saltwater taffy candy imported in greece	why is saltwater taffy candy imported in china	1	Why is salt water taffy candy imported in the United Kingdom?Is it? Never seen it anywhere. I only know the term from old Scooby Doo episodes.We don't have the word “Taffy” here, so if anyone wants taffy (rather than toffee or fudge), they would need to make it or import it.I asked an American living here what it was and I seem to remember she said it was softer than toffee, but not the same as fudge. If so, it might be different enough to import some, but probably not different enough to displace those two very popular types of traditional sweets*. If there aren't many people who want it, its unlikely to be economic to make it here. Especially if part of its appeal is in being a traditional american sweet.*I like bonfire toffee the best.

what are the minimum requirements to enter mit	how can i join mit	1	I admitted the undergraduate students to MIT for 28 years, nearly 10 as Dean of Admissions.  It is very difficult to describe how one gets admitted because it is a subjective process based on a variety of factors.  But let me say that of all the answers below, Anonymous is closest to the truth.  Simply put, you need a 'hook', which means something so special that it is pretty rare.  (A hook is also known in the admissions business as an 'institutional need', something that the schools want but will never tell the public about.  Div 1 athletes, children of major donors or celebrities, best in state, best in nation, academic superstars, someone who is published in a major publication, etc are examples nationally.  MIT has its own institutional needs that their outstanding admissions office works hard to identify and admit.)  Note that this is not just high scores and perfect grades, as most people believe.  It's different.   As Anonymous says, for MIT  be world-class at something (accent on 'world class'), crush school (that's right - crush it, no excuses) and build writing and interpersonal skills so you can communicate effectively with others.  MIT people are action people so the admissions office is looking for people who regularly make things happen for themselves and others with great self-initiative.  A deeper than normal curiosity is critical because that screams MIT.  And a fearlessness is necessary because not only is MIT the most extraordinary university of its kind on Earth, it's also one of the most demanding.  (There's no place to hide in the curriculum there as one can in Ivy schools.)  Each of these attributes must be represented by actual evidence in the case.  But it's the hook that gets one admitted.If I could tell future applicants anything, it is to understand the culture of the individual school and see if you are a match.  For example, MIT is an action place and so is well suited for action-types and not really that suited for intellectual types.  Also, do not pick a college based on ranking.  That's just ignorance.  All ranking systems have been designed to sell products so they are neither neutral authorities nor really true. You must learn about schools yourself in this era of Big Spin.  That takes work. And most importantly, don't take advice about college admissions from anyone who has never admitted for a living.  Your friends and parents know nothing about such an arcane process and do what we all do - make assumptions about how it appears to work and then act on the assumptions they just made up as if they were true (a process I refer to as M.S.U. - making sh*t up).  That never ends well since it isn't based in truth.I hope this helps.	Firstly visit here The Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT)Now you already know about GRE and TOEFL/IELTS, good.Being in college should give you some Extra-curriculars (ECA) to do. Try them- Things like MUNs, Debates, Quizzes.If possible join an NGO and be active.These things play a considerable role. MIT just doesn't want a Techie geeky nerd. They want a person, an all rounded one. So show that to them.Score perfect on your GREs (or somewhere in the ballpark)MIT is need-blind so if you can show you need FA they’ll provide you as much aid as they can (Maybe 100% as well)Build your profile, do things you always wanted to do (Constructive) and try to be the best at that in your city/state/country.If you are the best at something in the world and you have scores which are good, you are already in. (They admit top 1% of the world, at least thats what they say)Good luck~

what are natural numbers	what is a least natural number	0	Do you want to know what natural numbers really are?This is how they are set-theoretically defined at the very heart of all of mathematics, and anybody can understand it.In mathematics, we must start with some completely unambiguous mental concept that we have in common. What do we have in common?Nothing.So we start with nothing. The empty set, denoted {}{}\{ \} . The things inside the curly brackets are what is inside the set. As you can see, there is nothing in there, and when we regard it as a set, this amounts to conceptualizing it. {}{}\{\} is the concept of nothing, the empty set. This is the number 000, literally.Good. Now that we have the concept of nothing in common, we have in common the concept of the concept of nothing! This is the set containing the empty set, {{}}{{}} \{ \{ \} \} . This is the number 111, literally.Now that we have the concept of nothing and the concept of the concept of nothing, we have the concept of those two things! This is 222, formally written as {{},{{}}}{{},{{}}}\{ \{ \} , \{ \{ \} \} \} , the set that contains both the empty set and the set containing the empty set.Now we have three concepts in common, all built from nothing: 0,1,0,1,0, 1,  and 222. You can see what we do next: the concept of these three concepts is the number 333.Recursively, each natural number 𝑛nn is the set of its predecessors. This definition even applies to 000, which has no predecessors.So the natural numbers are:000 = {}{}\{\}111 = {{}}   {{}}   \{ \{\} \} \ \ \   ( = {0}{0} \{ 0 \})222 = {{},{{}}}   {{},{{}}}   \{ \{\}, \{ \{\} \} \} \ \ \  ( = {0,1}{0,1} \{ 0, 1 \})333 = {{},{{}},{{},{{}}}}   {{},{{}},{{},{{}}}}   \{ \{\}, \{ \{\} \}, \{ \{\}, \{ \{\} \} \} \} \ \ \  ( = {0,1,2}{0,1,2} \{ 0, 1, 2 \})⋮⋮ \vdots 𝑛={0,1,…,𝑛−1}n={0,1,…,n−1}n = \{ 0, 1, \ldots, n-1 \} That is what the natural numbers truly are. And as you can see, each number 𝑛nn contains precisely 𝑛nn things.We start with literally nothing, and then we have the concept of nothing, then the concept of the concept of nothing, and so on.It is thus that mathematics is built from thinking about nothing.	It is a matter of convention whether zero is a Natural number. If it is, it is the least, otherwise one is the least.In mathematics the set of Natural numbers is denoted ℕN\mathbb N or 𝐍N\mathbf N. This set almost always includes zero, that is 0∈ℕ0∈N0\in\mathbb N, and the set corresponds to the non-negative Integers.If you want the set of strictly positive Integers, it is usually denoted ℕ+N+\mathbb N^+ or ℤ>0Z>0\mathbb Z_{&gt;0}.In set theory it is natural to identify the Natural numbers with the finite Cardinal numbers. With this definition zero, being the cardinality of the empty set, is the least Natural number.If we interpret the phrase “least natural” as an English superlative adjective, my favourite number[1] 𝜍=𝜔‾‾√ς=ω\varsigma=\sqrt{\omega}, might qualify. The concept of a square root of infinity certainly seems unnatural to many people…Footnotes[1] Alan Bustany's answer to What is your favourite number and why?

how we can travel faster than light	is it possible to travel faster than light	1	1.Space: Space mean universe. You ever wondered, can light go across our universe? Answer is NO! The space is expanding at a speed which is far more than speed of light, and it is increasing. This phenomenon is called as metric expansion of universe. The rate of expansion of space is 67.15 ± 1.2 (km/s)/Mpc, roughly 68 (km/s)/Mpc.Metric expansion of space - Wikipedia2. Quantum entanglement : Actually this does not violates the Relativity as nothing happens which is faster than light. But when two quantum particles are entangled you can predict state other particle with respect to other irrespective of it's position in space. It might be at the other end of universe but still you can predict state of other particle and you can manipulate the state of other particle wrt here. And it does not takes any time to happen. So quantum entanglement is faster than light.3. LASER: Suppose you're pointing a strong laser towards moon and suddenly you change it's position. This slight misalignment will cause a movement of geometrical position of spot of light faster than speed of light. A laser is a unique source of light. But you'll ask if laser is a source of light then how come light travels faster than light itself. Actually, photons does travel at speed of light. But if you measure geometrical distance the spot of light travel in certain time. You'll get speed more than light.4.You but only through Wormhole: Einstein has hypothesized wrap in space time through which one travel through space and time. This would make you travel faster than light. But this would require tremendous amount of energy and there are no experimental proofs of this phenomenon.5. Tachyon: Tachyon is a hypothetical particle which is predicted to travel always more than speed of light. There is NO experimental evidence of this particle's existence. You can get more information at Tachyon - Wikipedia	Few things can actually travel faster than light. One among them is Cherenkov radiation.These are electromagnetic radiations emitted as electrons by the spent nuclear fuel particles when it is placed under water for quite a few years in the spent fuel bay in a nuclear power plant.The characteristic blue glow is due to emission of this radiation. Note here that the speed of Cherenkov radiation is greater than light only in water, where the VELOCITY OF LIGHT HERE BECOMES 0.75 x 3 x 10^8 m/s.I am luckily one among the few persons who have seen this radiation. I witnessed this in Madras Atomic Power Plant, Chennai, India some few months before. The colour glow will be just fabulous to witness.Hope it helps!! Feel free to comment.Cheers,KSAM
what are the differences between pocso and sexual offenses in the ipc	do we need the ipc section 375	0	In a landmark Judgment Bombay high court held that looking lusciously at minor children is punishable under the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act, 2005.Section 11 of POCSO act, 2005, defines the sexual harassment of a child. And accordingly Bombay High Court deemed that “constantly watching a child with sexual intent”.For more please refer to Lexcarts News blog LOOKING LUSCIOUSLY AT MINOR IS AN OFFENCE UNDER POCSO: BOMBAY HC published at Quora	Meaning of Marital RapeBefore expostulate the term Marital Rape, we have to understand the term Rape. Rape has been defined under Section 375 of IPC, 1860 and it endows that a man is said to enunciate rape when he penetrates his penis to any extent into the vagina of a woman. How far it has gone inboard vagina is intangible. Even slightest penetration of penis by a man into the vagina of a woman amounts to rape. Marital Rape refers to inexpedient sexual intercourse by a man with his own wife which is achieved by unlawful force, threat of force, or physical violence, or when she is in capacious to give her consent to such sexual copulation. Marital Rape is a non-consensual act of violence deformation by a husband against the wife where she is physically and sexually abused.More Info: - Lawyer in Patiala
what is an alternative for the word is	what is the alternative word for creative	0	There exists no true synonym for that particular verb in all its forms. I assert this because one can define it in English in seven different ways. A word that ambiguous can cause real frustration. I find it far more useful and effective to avoid it altogether.By way of example, you won't find it in the above paragraph. Or this one. But you might in the next. Or not.One other answer refers to E-Prime, developed by a student of Alfred Korzybski’s philosophy of General Semantics. Practicing it allows you to clear your thinking, replacing “to be” with whatever you actually mean by it. I highly recommend it as an exercise.(Please permit me to also recommend Language in Thought and Action by S.I. Hayakawa and Alan Hayakawa.)	"What is the alternative word for creative?Many many... many artists & designers use the word ""creative"" in their documents to describe themselves. I am curious to know if there are any alternative word(s).Imaginative, inventive, originative, ingenious, prolific, resourceful, artistic, fertile, clever, innovative, inspired, fruitful.Source: http://PowerThesaurus.org"
what is considered an illegal screen in the nba	shaquille oneal considers tim duncan a power forward therefore disqualifying duncan from the nba great big men discussion does oneal have a point	0	"Basically two things to bring up.  First, the player setting the screen needs to have his/her feet planted (not moving.). Second, and similar to the first, the player setting the screen cannot immediately and actively continue to ""get in the way"" of the player he just screened (or another defender for that matter.) This would be akin to blocking in American football (which is legal in football if you aren't holding the defender.) Not so shocking, many basketball players also play or used to play American football.  An illegal screen happens a lot on a ""pick and role situation"", when after ""the role"" the player who just set the pick continues to step in the way of defenders rather than freeing themselves up for a shot.  Other illegal uses I see a lot are when a really tall player uses his/her next step and exploiting their size to immediately get in the way of a defender (without being firmly planted.). It's highly unlikely you set up two sequential screens immediately right after the first one, yet players loose sight of this during a game, or they are actively breaking the rules withy the hope to not get called.  Bottom line is when a screen is set, the player setting the screen must stay still and they cannot immediately take a step and really expect that they are setting another screen.Note that after setting a screen you are obviously allowed to move and even try to get a get position."	First of all, Shaq has a vested interest in protecting and advancing his own legacy by discounting Tim Duncan as a center. In nearly every all-time NBA ranking, O’Neal is ranked behind Duncan. Therefore, disqualifying Duncan from the list would effectively advance Shaq a spot in the discussion of the greatest big men to play the game.Let’s also acknowledge that rankings and even position estimates are very subjective. Skill sets are changing; at one time a 7-footer like Dirk Nowitski would have been told to not shoot threes because that’s something that guards do; today he’s #15 all-time in 3-pointers made. We might call Lebron James a small forward even though he’ll be guarding a power forward on a nightly basis and the offense runs through him, with the ball in his hands as often as any point guard. Stephen Curry shoots the ball more than any shooting guard and the ball-handling responsibility moves around so much with the semi-positionless Warriors that he’s certainly not a “traditional” point guard, but we call him one anyway. James Harden is a shooting guard who leads his team in assists, dominates possession of the ball, and plays alongside a nominal point guard/defensive specialist in Patrick Beverley whose offensive contributions are significantly more limited. And does anyone even know what position Giannis Antetokounmpo plays? He’s grown since entering the league and is probably legitimately 7′0″ but Coach Kidd suggests he should be considered a point guard for the Bucks moving forward.Bottom line: we can assign these position labels, but ultimately who cares what they call you as long as you produce on the court, and that’s exactly what Tim Duncan did.The reason many people think of him as a power forward goes back to the start of his career, when he was playing alongside David Robinson after being drafted. He also possesses tremendous versatility with excellent passing skills and a strong midrange game, and the power forward position is often perceived as being the more skilled, “finesse” position of the two as opposed to the low-post battling of the two. ButAccording to Gregg Popovich, Duncan was the Spurs’ starter at center for the past 15 years; the exact number is a likely figure of speech from the acerbic Spurs coach but non-coincidentally it closely aligns with the end of the Robinson era in San Antonio. So for Shaq to say Duncan isn’t even a true big man is a bit much to swallow. But like I noted earlier, any attempt at ranking all NBA players regardless of era or position is going to be hopelessly imprecise anyway, so he’s free to consider Duncan any way he wants.
nothing excites me anymore how do i regain that excitement	why do i feel like i am excited about something when i have nothing to be excited about	0	Knowledge kills curiosity. So you have to unlearn all the stuff which you have learnt. It might seem stupid for first time but mind you it is the only way.Have you ever thought why small children are always happy?You also must be a happy child but happiness went away gradually with increase in age.Just imagine when you had seen sun for the first time then how much curious you were to know what it is, you did not knew its name.You just saw it with mind full of curiosity but when someone told you that it is sun and you got the knowledge about sun then your curiosity just went away as you know it is sun then what is the point looking at it.Same has happened to you with every aspect of life, you have known whatever you wanted to know, now you don't want to know anything because with your experience of knowing things deep down in your heart you know that knowing things didnot helped you in past.Knowledgeable mind always tells you the facts which you have known about the things when you see or think.Like if you see a flower- you will say it is rose, I know it but you missed the unknown present in rose.First thing to do is - When ever you see something donot pay attention to thoughts which your mind will create according to your past knowledge of that thing. Try to see the things like you are looking them for the first time, donot give names to the things in mind when you see them.Second important thing is to learn the art of- Being in the present.Mind always thinks weather of past or future, it never stays in the present which is the cause of all our miseries.Try to sit silently for 20–30 mins in a day by focussing on breathing. (Silently here means thoughtless).By practice you will be able to stay in the present and there is always happiness in the present.	Why do I feel tired, lazy and unmotivated all the time? I don't feel any excitement in my life anymore. I'm always feeling down and low all the time. Every day is the same day and nothing changes. How can I overcome this feeling?
what are the life lessons that batman teaches us	what are the life lessons you can learn from the dark knight	1	I am cognizant of the fact after reading the top answers for this answer that every exceptional and great scene of The Dark Knight Trilogy and the comics and the games have been cited and voiced, so there's no point in answering from the Movie point of view, because people over here according to me have described a particular scene from the movie and then went on to conclude in a line as to how did it effect the world.Rather I want to take a Movie Vs Reality approach in my answer. I will take different aspects and characteristics of the Batman and Bruce Wayne (Which I can make out of after having seen the trilogy for at least 10+ times) which have been displayed to the audience by the creators and directors.So Coming right to it,(This list is not at at all exhaustive and can be decoded and improvised according to one's appetite)Responsibility: Bruce Wayne went on to become the silent protector because he sensed a feeling of responsibility towards his city which was shattered and consumed by atrocities and lawlessness which also took his away his loved parents from him. He didn't want that to happen with the other inhabitants of Gotham City.But in real life, who are we responsible towards? We are responsible towards our parents, our life-partners, children and ultimately oneself. If you are dirty rich, then you've an obligation towards the needy people. You don't need to wear a cape for that. Perseverance and Patience: Bruce Wayne and Batman both lost everything they once had. Bruce Wayne lost his parents, his love, his friends (After the Birthday debacle in Batman Begins), his wealth and everything else he had cherished, his own Palace of a home. Batman lost Harvey Dent, he lost all the people who were killed by Bane, he lost his physical power to Bane, and much more.But in reality, we are faced with unsatisfactory jobs, we lose our loved ones, we lose jobs, homes but not faced with the herculean task of a city. We can look up to Mr. Wayne and Batman is that Life is all be being Patient. Patience is the key to lead a happy and content life. All is never lost, until you perceive it to be lost. Someone can take your wealth, but not your patience, not your will power. So never ever be under a false impression that you've lost EVERYTHING. Sacrifice: Bruce Wayne and The Dark Knight sacrificed everything they had. Bruce sacrificed his wealth, models, and a billionaire life. The Dark Knight sacrificed his identity for protecting his near ones. He sacrificed his Life for his city (Well, technically he is dead now in Gotham, after the third installment)In your life, if there comes a moment where you have to sacrifice something, do not think twice about it. It is just for the greater good. You just don't know what good just yet. Nobody is asking you to live a life of a recluse.

how do you stop a criminal  attempt to kidnap you so you escape unharmed	how do you stop a criminal  attempt to kidnap you and escape unharmed	1	Hippos, like bears, are faster than people and will 100% murder you if you fight it. As such, your best option is to never to that.However, if you are, strategies that work on bears will also work on hippos. Try running downhill. It will 100% outrun you, but you can move to the side a lot better than it can, and thereby escape. If there are no hills, you can still try to sidestep and run. Just know, it will probably chase after and murder you anyway.	"You're not going to like what I'm about to say. But that's okay. Truth is often bitter. And it always hurts.

It should have become a bible on this topic, where people come for enlightenment and having found their answer, they never procrastinate ever again in their lives.And yet, this thread still breathes. New answers are requested every day. What am I missing?When I was a kid, every year, my parents would take me to the fair. The fair came to our town every September and that one day would be the best day of my life. The moment we would enter the fair, my senses would be overwhelmed by the barrage of lights, and colors, and sounds. Hundred upon hundreds of stalls - spread out in the open under the starry sky - visible as far as your eyes could see. They carried sweets and decorations, utensils and pottery, paintings and woodworks, and toys. Oh my god, the toys! Shiny and colorful, big and small, beautiful things of every shape and size imaginable.A million toys, and I wanted them all.I remember, once in this shady looking stall, I saw a toy gun. My eight-year-old brain was immediately fascinated by the idea of owning it. I was a kid possessed. And I knew exactly how to get it.""Papa, I want that gun""""No""""But...""""No""An ugly fight ensued. Tears were involved. Slaps too. At some point, my mother tried to intervene but I was adamant. The gun was what I wanted and I was going to have it.In the end, my parents had to cave in. The gun was purchased. Triumphant, I returned home.For the next two days, I played with the gun to my heart's content. After all, I had fought brave and hard for it. Hell! I was going to play with it my whole life.Then, on the third day, I forgot about the gun. No, I didn't lose it or misplace it. I just… lost interest. I never bothered to pick it up again. It must still be lying somewhere at the bottom of some old dusty trunk inside my house, along with hundreds of other shiny toys that met with the same fate.You, there!Yes, you.Tell me. Can you see it yet? The truth?You're not looking for an answer to your procrastination, are you?You're looking for a shiny new toy.The tricks in the 2300 answers on this thread - that's what they are. Bright and shiny toys.Oh! the 'five-minute rule'! That sounds so interesting...Look! the 'first quantum rule'! How cool and sciency is that!What! Inside my brain, there's a scientist and a dinosaur? Fuck! This sounds so life-altering. I think this is what will fix all my problems.Welcome to the carnival of ""How to beat Procrastination"". We have a wide assortment of shiny tricks for you. Feel free to pick whichever one you can fool yourself into believing would change your life. Take it home, play with it for a couple of days, and when you get bored and throw it away, feel free to come back here for another shiny new trick.Wait! How do we know that you'll come back?Because you always do. Think. Think hard. Do you remember it now? This is not your first time here, is it? You have come to us before. Perhaps in a different place and time. But you have.Everyone has.So, why do we do it? Why do we fall in love with a shiny new toy only to throw it away in a couple of days?Here's the reason, and if you read just one line in this answer, this is the one you should -Sometimes, we fall in love with the ""idea of possessing something"" rather than the thing itself.You are here on this thread. Tell me, does reading every new trick in these answers give you a little dopamine rush, even though you haven't implemented it yet? When you sit down to apply it, do you feel the rush fading away? Do you then abandon the trick and come back to this thread to get a new trick and a new dopamine shot?If the answers to all these questions are affirmative, then perhaps you're more in love with ""the vision"" of you sitting in a dark room and working hard, having overcome your procrastination; rather than actually overcoming your procrastination, sitting in a dark room, and working hard.Can that be?So, what's the answer?There is none. Procrastination is just a symptom. A symptom of the fact that you don't realize just how short and precious your time on this planet is. Or how illogical it is to while it away. Procrastination shouldn't be a problem, any more than ""I know how important breathing is, but sometimes, I don't feel like doing it and keep putting it off"" is a problem.I mean, can you imagine Elon Musk logging in to Quora and asking the question -""I have to send rockets to Mars, but I can't stop procrastinating. What should I do?""But we can’t all be Musks, can we? So, let’s pretend that our stupidity has an official sounding name - “procrastination”. Let’s pretend that it is a ‘real’ problem for which an ‘efficient’ solution must exist, which we’ll perhaps find someday on some obscure quora or reddit thread.And until we do, let’s keep using ‘procrastination’ as an excuse to waste our time.In case we’re meeting for the first time,Hi, I’m Abhimanyu Sood, the storyteller.Thanks for reading my answer…"

daniel ek when an we expect spotify in india	daniel ek are there any future plans of releasing spotify in india	1	Before I start answering this question, I would like to say that there’s no organization in this world (except a few) who doesn’t want to expand. Even a street vendor in India who rises to popularity wants to expand within the city and even beyond that. So, first and foremost thing that Spotify isn’t available in India is not because they don’t want to expand. They surely want to expand, not only in India but in almost all countries in the world. In fact, think about it yourself, why wouldn’t Spotify want to expand in India, being the second most populous country in the world?Moving on to the main part of the answer, there are several reasons why Spotify isn’t available in India. Music licensing is one such trouble and it’s legal equivalent of herding sheep in space. Launching in a new market involves thousands of hours of legalese and negotiations with many people spanning many companies, and there is also generally large upfront investments needed, often of several million dollars. Even with all that work, things will only be partially under their (Spotify) control - they will need others to allow them to have their music on the service - until they’ve managed to convince the major labels in a country like T-Series, Sony Music Company to name a few, they simply cannot launch.India is of course an important market that they want to be in, but it's also an enormous country and therefore the label landscape is also enormously complex.Adding to that, India is a country with very spotty internet connectivity, something they're not used to (something similar was quoted by Snapchat’s CEO on being questioned about expanding Snapchat in India), and which creates a technical hurdle on top of the legal complexities. Nothing is unsolvable, of course, they have awesome people for both the problems, but it's non-trivial and they're not here yet.Once Spotify arrives in India, lite version can be launched for people having slow internet connectivity but tackling legal actions with dominance of major labels will tend to be their prime concern. Until Spotify isn’t available in India, you can refer to Sahil Singh's answer to How do I use Spotify in India? and continue using Spotify on your desktop / laptop / smartphone.I almost forgot to mention one more thing. Though it’s not the reason why Spotify isn’t available in India but it might be one of the highlights of this topic. Piracy, yes, you heard it right. We, Indians (majority) are so used to piracy that we won’t ever pay for paid subscription which is the primary source of Spotify’s revenue. In near future, even if Spotify is made available in India, number of paid subscribers will be very less in comparison to FREE users. In India, piracy can be broadly divided into 2 categories:First category deals with things for which we feel guilty at some point of time. This category includes piracy of movies.From the above point, it’s obvious that this section contains things for which we don’t feel guilty at all and there’s no scope of feeling so in near future. It includes piracy of softwares (especially Microsoft Windows, Microsoft Office etc), Android applications, songs etc. I once asked a friend of mine if he wants to share my Apple Music subscription or not and he replied saying “gaane ke liye kaun pay karta hai bey” (Who the hell pays for songs?)NOTE: Some readers may feel offended after reading this but ask yourself whether I’m saying right or wrong. Also, I’m not pointing out everyone out there, there are people who are not indulged in piracy and they should be proud that they are supporting the creators by doing so.

what does the phrase he who does not love abides in death exactly mean	what does the phrase love begets love mean	0	The quoted phrase “He who loves not abides in death” is taken from Bible. For understanding the meaning of messages in Bible you need to read it in the context.Love One Another (1 John 3: 11–15) “For this is the message that you have heard from the beginning, that we should love one another. We should not be like Cain, who was of the evil one and murdered his brother. And why did he murder him? Because his own deeds were evil and his brother’s righteous. Do not be surprised, brothers,c that the world hates you. We know that we have passed out of death into life, because we love the brothers. Whoever does not love abides in death. Everyone who hates his brother is a murderer, and you know that no murderer has eternal life abiding in him”.The message is clear, isn’t it? Even when there was only very few people on earth Cain thought of making everything for himself and killed his brother. It happened because he had no love for Abel, his brother.If you love a person and when he is getting praised for something you will be proud of him. You will feel proud for he is your friend.If the wife love husband she will be proud of him when husband gets acceptance in the society and appreciated by others. Because he belongs to her. But if wife do not love him she will be jealous and start hating him!Same is the case with all friends and family members. Love tolerates everything. Love take pride in everything.If you do not love your fellow beings there is no eternal bliss awaiting you.	As you sow, so shall you reap. This is one of the famous phrases used frequently.Literal meaning is, if you sow wheat then wheat will grow and wheat will be reaped not barely or rice.This phrase has a deep meaning and it revolves around the Karma, the deeds a person does. Anything you do has an outcome, it comes back to you in one or the other way. You can not escape the consequences of your actions. If you do good work, results will be good. If you do bad things in your life, you are going to get bad returns.What goes around comes around. Probably, Newton was also enlightened by this phrase and he derived the third law, “For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction,” but in real life reactions maybe more.If you take up any task with good intentions then the outcome will always be good. If your actions and intentions are bad then the results are going to fall in the bad directions.Watch your actionsImage source: Google

can you get high if someone touches weed and then you shake their hand and then you eat something with that same hand	if someone grabs you by your shirt with both their hands and tells you to shut up is that assault and can you call the police	0	You wouldn’t even notice if you touched a block of hash and then stuck your fingers in your mouth, and hash is pretty much pure active crystals smashed together. Maybe if you were responsible for separating kief from the rest of the plant and licked your fingers frequently, you might get something. Even then it wouldn’t amount to much unless that was your 8-hours-a-day job or something.	"If someone grabs you, that's battery.  Generally speaking, in the US, ""assault"" is the threat to commit a battery or other violence, while ""battery"" is actual physical contact.  You can call the police if the other person's words and actions alarmed and/or disturbed you.  Aside from the battery you suffered, causing someone to be alarmed and/or disturbed is often the basis for a general disorderly conduct complaint.Of course, an officer will probably ask what happened before the battery.  Depending on the situation and location, you might end up being the person in trouble instead of the other person."
considering the current trend of information technology what is the future of print media	what is this model  name i see her everywhere	0	I believe that the print media as such will never cease to exist: it's a cheap and very affordable technology that does not require, say, electricity to run. It can be produced easily and with little knowledge, and it can be placed anywhere or handed out, given away and dispersed in many ways. It can reliably store data for many years.  As for the books, I believe the same: the books themselves aren't going to change that much, they're just about to change the media from paper to e-ink or whatever the future is. And printed books will follow the vinyl records: they will still be there for those of us who love to smell the freshly printed books, and for those who don't want to rely on their gadgets for reading.

"Here's an easy and approachable pizza recipe that will yield excellent results.  Follow it closely and you'll be able to make an amazing pizzeria quality pizza at home.  I've made over a thousand pizzas and this is the recipe I share with people because it doesn't require special oven or a mixer.   All that's needed is a baking stone/steel and an inexpensive scale.  With the exception of the flour, which is really important (more on that below), it's pretty easy to find the ingredients at the supermarket.Note:  This answer focuses on making the dough.  The sauce, shaping and preparation are also very important but probably something that should be addressed in a separate question/answer.  Ingredients796 grams high gluten flour - Pendleton Power or General Mills All Trumps brand is what most pizzerias use.  See below.493 grams filtered water - Dasani, Aquafina or spring water is fine.1 teaspoon active dry yeast - Instant dry yeast or rapid rise yeast is fine if active dry yeast is unavailable. 2.5 teaspoons fine sea salt - Don't use coarse sea salt or table salt.1 teaspoon sugar - Plain old white sugar.1 teaspoon diastatic malt - If diastatic malt is unavailable, use 1/2 teaspoon of sugar, bringing the total amount of sugar to 1.5 teaspoons.1 tablespoon olive oil - Extra-virgin imparts too much flavor.  Use a plain olive oil.  About the IngredientsPizza making, and baking in general, is all about precision and attention to detail.  Everything makes a difference, and seemingly unimportant details, are important, so a few notes:Flour - The type of flour used is really, really important.  You can use what you have lying around, but it won't be nearly as good as using a high gluten flour.  If you go to an amazing New York style pizzeria, you'll probably find big bags of Pendletons Power or General Mills All Trumps in the kitchen.  You can also use King Arthur Sir Lancelot, but in my opinion, it's better suited for bread making.Water - It's not uncommon to hear people say that New York pizza is great because of the water.  This is a misleading statement.  Good water is a factor in pizza, but it isn't what makes pizza great.  You can't use bad water, but it just needs to be good enough.  Filtered water or spring water will do just fine if the tap water isn't good in your area.Yeast - Use active dry yeast if possible.  SAF or Red Star are great brands.  Trader Joe's will have these, so will some supermarkets.  If not, any brand will work.  Make sure it's not too old.Salt - For the most part, salt is salt.  Don't use table salt because it's too salty.  Don't use coarse salt because it might not dissolve properly. Diastatic Malt - Malt, if you have it, is an excellent browning and flavoring agent.  It's more subtle than sugar, but not required.  Preparing the DoughMeasure the ingredients - You'll notice we're using weight measurements (grams instead of cups).  A cup of flour can a significant variance. But 125 grams of flour is 125 grams of flour.  Whisk yeast and water - Add the yeast to the water and whisk for about 15-20 seconds.  The water should be lukewarm, about 85F, or warm to the touch.Mix flour and water/yeast mixture - Pour the water/yeast mixture into a large mixing bowl.  Add about 500 grams of the flour.  This doesn't need to be exact.  Using a wooden spoon, mix the flour/water mixture until it comes together.  It should take about 30 seconds for it to form into a batter-like consistency.Add the remaining ingredients - Add the remaining ingredients to the bowl:  salt, sugar, malt, olive oil and remaining flour.  With your hands, mix the dough for about 4-5 minutes.  You should end up with a nicely formed ball.  There shouldn't be any dough or ingredients sticking to the side of the bowl.Cover and Rest - Cover the bowl with a towel or some plastic wrap and set aside for 30 minutes.Knead and Ball - Grab the dough and give a quick knead (5-10 seconds).  You'll notice that the dough is much smoother than it was 30 minutes ago.  Using a dough cutter or a knife, divide the ball into 4 balls,  each 325 grams in weight.  A 325 gram ball will make a 13"" pizza.  This is a great video on balling dough:   Refrigerate - Place each dough ball onto a tray or individual plastic bowls.  If using a tray, cover tightly with plastic wrap.  I prefer plastic bowls.  Coat the bowl with a tiny amount of oil.  This prevents sticking.  Next, place the dough in the refrigerator for 48 hours.Making The PizzaAfter 48 hours, the dough will be ready for shaping.  As mentioned previously, stretching the dough, making a sauce and topping the pie are worthy of their own posts, so I won't go into great detail here.  Here are some basic steps though:Preheat Oven - Place a stone or baking steel in the oven and preheat to 500F.  Allow the oven to warm up for an hour.  This is important.  30 minutes, as most recipes call for, isn't enough. Remove dough from the refrigerator - Take the dough out of the refrigerator and allow it to warm up.  Place on the counter for an hour while the oven heats up.Shaping the Dough - Sprinkle some flour on a clean, dry countertop or surface.  Remove the dough from the container or tray and dunk it into a bowl of flour and shake off the excess flour.  Stretch the dough.  Here's a good video on shaping dough: Place on a Peel / Top - Once the dough is shaped, place it on a lightly floured pizza peel.  Add the sauce, cheese and toppings.  It's important to complete this step quickly to prevent the dough from sticking to the peel.  Give the peel a tap/shake every 15-20 seconds to keep it moving.  Bake - Slide the pizza from the peel onto the stone/baking steel.  Bake until done, most likely 8-12 minutes.  Each oven is different. There's a good chance the recipe will yield excellent results even on the first try.  If not, keep trying.  Technique is very important, and like most things, practice makes perfect."
what are some good places to learn mountaineering in india	what are some good mountaineering institutes for a beginner level mountaineering course	1	A2A,I've written about this before, but suffice to say that I have yet to find any evidence of Indian Mountaineering courses and institutes of providing anything other than techniques that were out of date in the 80s, and gear that is not suitable for mountaineering:What are some top institutes in India to get certified in mountaineering, skiing, rafting, kayaking, and paragliding?With that said this only matters if your goal is to learn how to bag peaks, and climb mountains independently. The majority of climbing in India focuses on the commercial climbing method, or siege style. They used aid climbing and fixed ropes to ascend all but the easiest terrain instead of technical skill and physical ability. So if you’re happy being a cog in a slightly unsafe machine, then Indian Mountaineering Instituites will provide you with excellent opportunities to help out other people on summits until you have risen up in the hierarchy.Here is why the course are terrible from the perspective of classical mountaineering and alpinism:Skills that critical to mountaineering (whiteout navigation, glacier travel, free climbing, proper rappel techniques) are absent, or undervalued on these courses in favour of fixed lines.Many of the techniques and equipment used on courses I have seen photographic evidence of are incredibly dangerous and would lead to serious legal consequences in other parts of the world.The fact this exists shows there is no oversight, or standards within Indian mountaineering. Instruction in safety techniques should ALWAYS have oversight from legitimate authorities. The lack of proper safety procedures reveals the whole system is brokenCalling this out led to outrage, and frustration towards myself, rather then the actually systems which were objectively incorrect according to every other international standard.I would strongly recommend against taking any course from anyone without IFMGA and UIAA accreditation. IFMGA and UIAA use scientific methods to test various techniques and practices. Nepal is the closest country with IFMGA certified guides: Nepal National Mountain Guides AssociationMajor skills are absent, or undervalued on these coursesThe courses do offer good comraderie, and a excellent chance to experience what a climbing expedition might look like in the Indian style.With that being said, I am biased by my western notions of mountaineering as a independent means of travel in hazardous environments that focus on small groups, onsight climbing and route finding, free climbing (gear and ropes, but ascent by purely physical rather than mechanical means), moving faster, and lighter.Mountaineering traditions in India were legitimate thirty years ago. Today they haven't evolved and are behind the rest of the world. The sole focus is on siege style methods, aid climbing, and “attacking” and “conquering” peaks with very large groups and any means necessary. Such style was rejected by European climbers in the fifties, though they kept the practice up in the Himalayas well into the 80s. Commercial expeditions too continue to follow this trend.But this style is rejected by guides, alpinists and mountaineers in the west, and southern America thanks to fancy lightweight gear, and leisure time to allow for skills and fitness training. there is also less social stigma for climberswho choose not to adhere to the norms of building families and careers. These options are not available to the average Indian, and to a certain extent one should make the best of what is available to them.But please review the answer I wrote. Some of the techniques taught have led to loss of life. I would highly recommend purchasing a UIAA recommended textbook like Mountaineering: The Freedom of the Hills, 8th Edition or Alpine Skills: Summer . Be critical of your instructors. Remember they are a self-certified organizations which means nothing. Trust these books over your instructors. These textbooks have been built on decades of learning from thousands of professionals using scientific methodology.Also, perhaps write to this program Arc'teryx Alpine Academy - Chamonix and tell them you are interested in bringing alpine style climbing to the growing market of Indian mountaineers. If you can convince Arc'teryx you could make money for them, perhaps they would sponsor you to go on the course.	A2A,I've written about this before, but suffice to say that I have yet to find any evidence of Indian Mountaineering courses and institutes of providing anything other than techniques that were out of date in the 80s, and gear that is not suitable for mountaineering:What are some top institutes in India to get certified in mountaineering, skiing, rafting, kayaking, and paragliding?With that said this only matters if your goal is to learn how to bag peaks, and climb mountains independently. The majority of climbing in India focuses on the commercial climbing method, or siege style. They used aid climbing and fixed ropes to ascend all but the easiest terrain instead of technical skill and physical ability. So if you’re happy being a cog in a slightly unsafe machine, then Indian Mountaineering Instituites will provide you with excellent opportunities to help out other people on summits until you have risen up in the hierarchy.Here is why the course are terrible from the perspective of classical mountaineering and alpinism:Skills that critical to mountaineering (whiteout navigation, glacier travel, free climbing, proper rappel techniques) are absent, or undervalued on these courses in favour of fixed lines.Many of the techniques and equipment used on courses I have seen photographic evidence of are incredibly dangerous and would lead to serious legal consequences in other parts of the world.The fact this exists shows there is no oversight, or standards within Indian mountaineering. Instruction in safety techniques should ALWAYS have oversight from legitimate authorities. The lack of proper safety procedures reveals the whole system is brokenCalling this out led to outrage, and frustration towards myself, rather then the actually systems which were objectively incorrect according to every other international standard.I would strongly recommend against taking any course from anyone without IFMGA and UIAA accreditation. IFMGA and UIAA use scientific methods to test various techniques and practices. Nepal is the closest country with IFMGA certified guides: Nepal National Mountain Guides AssociationMajor skills are absent, or undervalued on these coursesThe courses do offer good comraderie, and a excellent chance to experience what a climbing expedition might look like in the Indian style.With that being said, I am biased by my western notions of mountaineering as a independent means of travel in hazardous environments that focus on small groups, onsight climbing and route finding, free climbing (gear and ropes, but ascent by purely physical rather than mechanical means), moving faster, and lighter.Mountaineering traditions in India were legitimate thirty years ago. Today they haven't evolved and are behind the rest of the world. The sole focus is on siege style methods, aid climbing, and “attacking” and “conquering” peaks with very large groups and any means necessary. Such style was rejected by European climbers in the fifties, though they kept the practice up in the Himalayas well into the 80s. Commercial expeditions too continue to follow this trend.But this style is rejected by guides, alpinists and mountaineers in the west, and southern America thanks to fancy lightweight gear, and leisure time to allow for skills and fitness training. there is also less social stigma for climberswho choose not to adhere to the norms of building families and careers. These options are not available to the average Indian, and to a certain extent one should make the best of what is available to them.But please review the answer I wrote.

do new table tennis balls damage rubbers	how do you unlock a car with a tennis ball	0	They don't. Table Tennis rubbers get damaged because of:Hitting on the table whiling chopping low balls or top spinning just-outside-table ballsGetting regularly brushed up against one's own clothesGetting brushed against other people when playing in a crowded placeErosion with timeBut never by the ball… unless you are playing with spiky metal balls.	"Sorry John, Prayas and Alex. The ""tennis ball trick"" is pure bullsh1t. It doesn't, can't and never has worked.Really old Mercedes door locks DID work on a vacuum line to lock/unlock.... but the tennis ball gag creates higher pressure air rather than a vacuum.And before someone suggests using your cellphone to TRANSMIT the open command from someone else holding the remote - again I call Bullsh1T! Mobile phones don't broadcast in the same frequency as that put out by a remote control - usually either 315 or 433 MHZ. So the signal can't be transmitted by a phone!!"
is it wrong for me to be content with my life	what is a cover story	0	I am 25 and I too consider myself content and I dont run behind money , job .I have a job, enough money for my expenses and a good family . I consider myself to be the luckiest man on earth. But my advise to you will be that at this age 21 what you are earning is enough . But when you will get married at age of 27–30 you will have responsibilities of 4 more people in ur life . Your parents , your wife and your kid . So at that point of time you cant say you are content and expect the other family members to be content too .In case of any medical emergency the hospitals will only entertain you if you have a bag full of money otherwise you may lose a loved one .Being satisfied is the perfect option only if there are no strings attached to you .So at this young age if you have a good job you are blessed . But see to it that you take it as blessing and continue to work hard . And do not let your laziness make you feel content . ;)A big storm is coming towards you and you should be prepared for it .Hope I am clear . I am glad to see that I met someone in quora who thinks exactly the way I think .	Cover Story is generally the main story in a magazine relating to the picture on the front cover.Feature Story is an article or report of a person, event, an aspect of a major event often having a personal view and written in an individual style.I hope I answered you question but if I need to elaborate then probably your question must be more explicit.
is gravity only a theory	according to the mtheory there are 11 dimensions why are only 5 dimensions in regards to gravity addressed in interstellar	0	Yes it’s just a theory.Just like the theory of Electromagnetism or the theory of Evolution. Bohr’s atomic model was just a theory which we don’t use now since we have a better theory- Quantum mechanical model of the atom. Until it is not falsifiable and can predict the future then it is correct else not.Newton’s gravitation was disproved a 100 years ago by Einstein’s relativity. After that we are still using Einstein’s relativity in our calculations which require precision, because Newton’ s theory isn’t completely wrong it is just a is generalization (or special case) of Relativity.The current theory of gravity breaks down at the quantum level and hence scientists worldwide are working on quantum gravity and when that theory will be found then we’ll have better theory. That’s how science works.I’m hoping that you are asked about the currently used theory of gravitation and not doubting the presence of a fundamental force-gravity itself. If former is the case then read on, if latter case then I’m sorry for you.	"It's because M theory is merely one of the many theories that are vying to be the 'Grand Unification Theory' or 'Theory of Everything""Other such frameworks are 'Quantum Loop gravity', 'String Theory', '12 dimensional Super Gravity' etc. All of them trying to reconcile General Relativity and Quantum Physics. (They are mutually exclusive frameworks as of now)We need a theoretical framework for gravity at the quantum scale in order to understand The Big Bang and gravitational singularities correctly, while also bringing all laws of physics under a single umbrella.Also, such theories aren't really theories as of now, due to lack of evidential support. Merely competing hypotheses. You are free to believe in any one of them until we prove one specific idea with observation and evidence.In the film, it's never really mentioned what data Cooper uncovers inside the black hole's singularity. They've only shown that he succesfully discovers some data that his daughter uses to come up with a new framework that will save humanity by allowing us to manipulate gravity.The film borrows parts from most of the competing ideas and other works of science fiction. And presents the borrowed ideas as a final solution while leaving a lot of things vague and unexplained on purpose. That's just good film making. They could not have made a documentary. Could they?"
how could i become a fighter pilot when i have less than the required eyesight	i have terrible eyesight can i still become a fighter pilot in the air force	0	The first thing you must understand is that there is much more to being a fighter pilot than looking cool and making women swoon. (Although those are certainly major bonuses when it comes to Naval Aviators)The job of a combat aviator is to be technically and tactically proficient with your aircraft in order to locate, close with, and destroy the enemy by delivering the weapons at your disposal.Basically killing bad guys by being smarter, quicker, better equipped and more lethal than they are.The training is long, tough intellectually, emotionally and physically. So tough that despite caliber of those selected, it can be the first time in their lives the student pilots face failure or tough criticism. It's humbling, yet extraordinarily rewarding.If you're a SJW, pansy, democrat, or any kind of liberal, “gender bender”, druggie, gun hater, or other sort of troublemaker, THIS IS NOT YOUR PLACE. While you may be physically capable of flying the jet, your mind works counter to the mission, and your presence is disruptive to your peers, making their job needlessly more difficult and risky to their lives.BE SURE YOU WANT TO BE HERE FOR THE RIGHT REASON.The act of flying the jet is an individual sport, it takes massive teamwork to get to that point. Thus, experience in such an environment helps. And it affects which service you choose to fly for.But back to the original question.Finish high school with high grades.DO NOT ENLIST. Pilots are Commissioned Officers with 4-year college degrees. While there are enlisted-to-officer programs, they are infrequent, highly competitive, and if you're in a critical MOS, you won't be allowed to leave until enlistment is up. GO TO COLLEGE.Start thinking about where to go to college early. If you want to go to Annapolis, West Point, Coast Guard, or Air Force, you better be working on it by your sophomore year. ROTC Scholarships, by Junior year. We will discuss service selection later.involved in extracurricular activities and/or sports.Be computer savvy. Hate to say it, but video games play a part in warfare today…Flight Simulator is goodStay fit. This is not a carnival ride. Fighting another jet or CAS when you're being shot at can be as brutal as a car crash.If you can afford it, get your private pilot's license. Learn the airspace, navigation, planning etc. Don't worry if you can't do this, because flying a cessna is so different than what you'll be doing, unless you've become truly proficient, it won't make much difference. The ground school, however, will.READ. Read news, history, biography, trade journals. Understand what you're heading for technically, historically, personally, and politically.Decide upon a college. If it's USNA, USMA, USCGA, USAFA, you're on autopilot for 4 years. Elsewhere, even if no scholarship, get involved in ROTC or the USMC OCC/PLC program immediately.Get a 4-year degree in something useful and technically oriented…biology, chemistry, computer science, engineering, geology, history(with technical electives), mathematics, physics, etc. NOTHING THAT ENDS IN “STUDIES”. While most any major is acceptable, these will make your journey easier because you simply must understand the dynamics of flight, weapons, and warfare.Get good grades in college. Be involved in previously mentioned commissioning programs. If they offer Aviation Guarantee, take it and don't screw it up.Accept your commission. Complete basic officer training. Go to flight school. Do well, and select your pipeline, then your jet.But what if you're a well-rounded, top achieving, high school graduate who has stayed away from the dark side of temptation, find yourself in college, taking the right courses, but are a “late decider”, not in ROTC or PLC/OCC, and want to fly?You can still do it.While I'd suggest applying to all 3 branches that fly fighters (and Coast Guard & Army if you'd fly bombers, transports or helos), consider what branch suits you best. Understand even in the other branches, you can end up a bomber, transport, or helo pilot too, if your grades are lower, or if you choose those routes.SERVICE SELECTIONFirst and foremost, the United States Marine Corps Naval Aviator is the epitome of fighter pilots and military men. Once out of jet flight school, you will fly F-35Bs, F-35Cs, F-18s, Harriers, or for a couple more years, Prowlers. You'll go to the boat and CQ (Carrier Qualify) like the Navy guys, but you'll also land the VTOL jets on amphibs, and operate from land bases. (Which makes your duty to the adoring women of the world somewhat more convenient). Do understand USMC life is more austere than the others, so the cameraderie with your fellow officers is critical. If you loved Fraternity life in College, this is a good fit. Remember, the entire USMC is in support of Troops on the Ground. You're a fighter pilot until you clear the airspace, then you're doing strike, attack, CAS, in support of the Marines on the ground. (Flying low and fast is more fun than flying high and fast anyway…) Being a Marine Corps Officer is truly different than all others. An honor and a privilege. And it's the branch least corrupted by political correctness. If you want to be at the tip of the spear, this is where you want to be.A close second are our brothers and peers in the US NAVY. Both USMC and USN go through the exact same training. They fly pretty much the same jets…but no VTOL…although the mission is different. It's carrier-centric, and you deploy at sea for 6 months at a time. Still, Navy and Marines interoperate seamlessly all the time. Navy life is similar to USMC for junior officers, but later on the Navy is more “buttoned down” and less tolerant of eccentricities. Sadly, political correctness has all but destroyed the “Top Gun” ethos in any way visible to the public. But Naval Aviation remains an incredible place for men of honor, skill, confidence and action. (Even if they aren't Marine Officers)The USAF. Yep, they have the F-22. They have F-35As. They have F-15A/C/Ds, They have F-16s. But since all students take the same syllabus, unless you are at the top, there's a LOT of seats to fill in B-52s, KC-135s, KC-10s, C-5s, C-17s, etc. Great if your goal is to be an airline pilot in 10 years. Sucks if you want to be a fighter pilot. The USAF is the branch most deeply corrupted by political correctness. Much of this is because the USAF has the fewest combatants in proportion to the overall size of the service, the lowest overall physical standards, and the fewest leaders who have actually faced enemy action. This breeds a ”corporate” culture where inferior individuals brown-nose their way into positions of authority while their braver, stronger, smarter, more honorable peers are off in harm’s way with the Marines, Navy and Army. While this crap is fine in a hippie commune, it's absolutely toxic to a military organization. Certainly, the USAF Fighter Wings and Squadrons, because of the type of man who is capable of becoming a fighter pilot, have a lifestyle approaching that of the USMC and USN, but they can't land on Aircraft Carriers, and women will always seek out the Naval Aviators first. Admittedly, the USAF lifestyle is the most comfortable. Their base facilities rival Club Med. Even deployed, comfort comes first. Where the Marines and Army dig a trench to give birth to a liberal, the USAF has air-conditioned tents with running water and flush toilets. Where the USMC slept on cots in tents on the muddy airfield in Aviano, Italy, the USAF aircrew were coddled in luxury chalets and hotels in the mountains, shuttled back and forth in helicopters like Russian oligarchs.All joking aside, we're all on the same team. Regardless of the branch, American aviators are the best in the world.There are differences between the branches. Figure out what suits you best.Understand that to become a fighter pilot…USMC, USN, or USAF… you must be one of the best. Tens of thousands dream of doing it, but only a couple hundred guys a year actually make it. You're going to end up in a very exclusive club, and the work is just beginning when you earn your wings.To summarize:Prepare. Morally, mentally, physically.Graduate HS. Top grades, activities.Follow commissioning path through college.Excel in flight school.Fly fighters.	"Yes....you can...The road to becoming a pilot can be challenging, but the following is information about where to take your first steps and a basic idea of what is in store. There is a large amount of free information concerning certification, training and various things available straight from the FAAStep One:   Obtain a First Class Medical CertificateA ""First Class"" medical is something that you'll need to maintain throughout your pilot career. I won't go into the particulars of the medical however I highly recommend obtaining one if you'd like to be an airline pilot. You can look in the yellow pages for ""Aeromedical Surgeon"" or call the local FSDO (Flight Standards District Office) for a listing of doctors that can examine you in your local area. Contrary to popular belief, you can wear glasses and still be an airline pilot as long as your vision is correctable to 20/20.Even if you cannot pass a class one medical, discover this early enough to weigh your options. There are circumstances in which you could apply for a medical flight waiver (even I had one of these for a period of time) and the earlier you begin this process, the better.Step Two:   Private Pilot CertificateThis phase is approximately 40 hours of flying time in which you learn basic maneuvers, navigation skills, and some basic instrument skills.Step Three:   Instrument RatingAfter you've built up some hours after your PPL, you begin to work on your instrument rating.   Basically, you learn to fly the aircraft solely by reference to the instrument panel.  You do various instrument approaches and cross country flights in actual or simulated instrument conditions.Step Four:   Commercial Certificate(s)The certification requires demonstration of advanced maneuvers and more precise flying skills than shown for the private pilot check ride.  You need at least 250 hours in order to qualify for this certificate. Also, many students will begin their multi-engine training in which you learn to fly a multi-engine aircraft -- usually a Beechcraft Duchess, Piper Seminole or Seneca. You will be responsible for demonstrating that you can do instrument approaches with both and only one engine operating.Step Five:  Time building!You can obtain your Certified Flight Instructor certificate in order to build flight time by instructing other student pilots, fly banner towing, friegh, aerial surveying, or whatever else you can do to build flight time. Some freshly certified commercial pilots are fortunate enough to be offered positions at a regional airline affiliated with the flight school at which they learned. Flying for a regional airline is critical because you fly advanced equipment into high density airports and hone the skills that major airlines are looking for in a new hire pilot.Step Six:  The Airline Transport Pilot CertificateYou can think of the ATP certificate as the ""Master's Degree of Flying"". You're eligible for this license when you have at least 1500 hours and meet some other requirements. Without an ATP, many major airlines really wouldn't want to consider your application until you do. I received my ATP during my initial captain upgrade training at Skyway Airlines a few years ago.FinallyApply. Apply. Apply.You may think that you're not ready for a job at a major, but unless you apply, they don't know you're out there. I'd even recommend apply to every major airline when you hit the 1000 hour mark. By the time you've earned your ATP, you've already built a history in the human resources file at the majors and be persistent.Anyone working for the majors would agree that this business is ""feast or famine"". Either no job offers are coming through or there is a FLOOD.Cheers...best of luck...!!!"

Finding Lower Back Pain ReliefNearly everyone will experience some form of back pain in his or her lifetime. The low back is the area behind the belly from the rib cage to the pelvis and is also called the lumbar region. Back pain is a major cause of missed work. Low back pain usually resolves on its own and is commonly the result of a strain injury. There are many treatments for low back pain.At Risk for Lower Back Pain?Low back pain can start in a person's early twenties and continue on throughout adulthood. Studies have shown that up to 80% of the general population are affected by low back pain (LBP) at some time during their lives. Learn to prevent lower back pain by knowing what activities could be putting you at risk.Common Causes of Low Back PainManual materials handling (especially lifting)Twisting of the trunkBending the trunk forwardBending the trunk to the sideExcessive reachingFallsProlonged sittingSedentary jobsHighly physical jobsExposure to whole-body vibrationCigarette smokingObesityExtreme tallnessLow Back Pain Symptoms: Does Your Back Hurt?Low back pain symptoms range from sharp and stabbing to a dull ache. The pains can be constant or intermittent and positional. Acute low back pain can appear suddenly after injury. Chronic back pain is defined as pain lasting more than three months. Consult a doctor if you have prolonged back pain longer than 72 hours.Low Back Pain and Serious Back InjuriesSevere back pain after an injury should be evaluated by a health-care professional. Warning signs of more serious injury include pain with coughing or urinating, loss of control of the bowels or bladder, new leg weakness, and fever. These additional symptoms require medical evaluation.Is It Muscle Strain or Sciatica?Back pain that occurs after excessive exercise or heavy lifting is frequently a strain injury. However, occasionally these activities cause disc injury and rupture or herniation. When a herniated disc irritates the sciatic nerve, it can cause back pain.What is Sciatica?Sciatica is a form of nerve pain caused by pressure on the sciatic nerve. The sciatic nerve is a large nerve that runs down through the buttocks and extends down the back of the leg. Pressing on or pinching of the sciatic nerve causes shock-like or burning low back pain. Sometimes people feel as if the pain radiates down through the buttocks and down one leg, sometimes even reaching the foot.Is Your Job Causing Back Pain?A job that involves pulling, lifting, or twisting with the low back can cause injury and low back pain. Even prolonged sitting in an awkward position can cause low back pain. Standing on your feet for hours on end? That can cause lower back pain too. The best way to prevent back pain is to know if you are at risk.Jobs That Can Cause Lower Back PainAirline crew (pilots, baggage handlers)SurgeonsNurses & healthcare workersBus and cab driversWarehouse workersConstruction workersCarpet installers and cleanersFarmers (agricultural, dairy)Firefighters and policeJanitorsMechanicsOffice personnel (eg, telemarketers, file clerks, computer operators)Find Back Pain Relief: Lighten Your BagsCarrying an overstuffed purse, briefcase, or handbag can strain the low back. If you must carry a heavy load, consider using a wheeled briefcase instead. By reducing the amount of weight you're carrying, you reduce the amount of pressure on the spine. Help keep your kids' backs healthy by making sure their backpacks are not overloaded. A heavy backpack could mean future back pain for your little ones.Workouts That Can Cause Low Back PainMost athletic injuries to the back are sprains of the ligaments or strains of the muscles surrounding the spine. Serious conditions or complications can have similar symptoms to those of a routine sprain or strain. The most common sports injuries occur after repetitive overuse of the spine either through twisting, compr...
have cavemen been scientifically tested	have mythical creatures been scientifically tested	0	First, a theory can be “proven” beyond a reasonable doubt. Any doubt the theory “the earth is round” has been proven?Second, there are a considerable number of observations that species of Homo lived in caves in southern Europe and the Mideast. There are remnants of fires, stone tools, flakes from when the stone tools were being made, bones of large animals broken open to get at the marrow, paintings in caves, etc. All these indicate that Homo sapiens (us) and Homo neanderthals lived in these caves.There is also evidence that some caverns within caves were used as burial sites, particularly an example in Spain and H. naledi fossils in South Africa.	Hobbits: Excavations of a limestone cave on the Indonesia island of Flores uncovered a three-foot-tall skeleton with a skull one third the size of a normal human—a hobbit. Researchers discovered the bones of nine such people, the youngest of which dates back about 12,000 years. They also found tools and other signs of civilization. There are skeptics who believe the hobbits are simply humans that suffered from a growth inhibiting condition such as microcephaly, but the popular opinion among scientists is that the hobbits are a separate species like Neanderthals that shared a common ancestor with humans. Moby Dick & Captain Ahab: Not only was Moby Dick inspired by an actual giant white sperm whale, but the real one was infinitely more badass. He was named Mocha Dick, perhaps because he lived near the island of Mocha. He came off victorious against a hundred whaling ships, sending some in splinters to the bottom of the sea. He also took on three whaling ships at once and won.Captain Ahab was also inspired by a man living around the same time as Mocha Dick. Captain Pollard didn’t seek revenge after his ship was wrecked by a whale, forcing him and his crew to resort to cannibalism to survive, but he did go back out to sea as the captain of a new ship . . . that also was sunk—this time by a storm. He spent his remaining years as a night watchman.
can climate change be reversed	can the global climate change be reversed or halted	1	Can the climate change be reversed?This question is almost the same as:Are the Climate change effects we experience reversible?The climate will be changing in a number of ways, some maybe be reversible, others not.One change that appears to be approaching quite quickly is melting permafrost in the Artic regions. This will be an irreversible tipping point as there is a massive quantity of carbon stored within the permafrost, biological matter that has been trapped by snow that turns into ice, and clath-hydrates. As the permafrost melts then this matter is then released, and degrades into methane, a greenhouse gas that is around 86 times stronger than carbon dioxide, once released this carbon matter cannot be recaptured so would therefore lock in substantially higher temperatures as there are estimates that the Arctic carbon is of the order of 11 years worth of human emissions. There is also significant carbon stored in the seabed in the form of methane clathrate or hydrates, although the mechanism around this form of methane is poorly understood, possibly implicit in 6C warming during the end-Permian extinction:Clathrate gun hypothesis - WikipediaThe IPCC has given us 12 years which suggests considering irreversible climate tipping points.It is therefore expedient to consider the risks, there are substantial risks in allowing Climate Change to progress, therefore it would be prudent to address Climate Change mitigation. A key part of mitigating Climate Change is the reduction of fossil fuel combustion, a point that will come at some stage as there is not an infinite supply of fossil fuels, so by bringing forward the move to carbon free energy we are reducing the risks, and massively reducing the wide range of pollution and it’s consequent health issues becoming pressing in many large cities. From an economic standpoint, renewable energy resources are falling below carbon in generation costs, suggesting economic benefit from migrating away from carbon based energy sources.	"Yes we can, rapidly.Most of the people answering that it can’t, or that it would take hundreds or thousands of years are focusing mainly on emissions and not the other side of the carbon cycle. Even the few that acknowledged the other side of the carbon cycle, focused mainly on CCS and afforestation. Neither of which is up to the job. So I understand their concerns and don’t dispute their numbers, except they are missing something.Recent advancements in the biological sciences have discovered a biochemical pathway that we have been missing for well over 100 years. This is the way the biosphere naturally builds deep fertile soils and cools the planet.Cenozoic Expansion of Grasslands and Climatic CoolingEven though this is in the fossil record, the actual way the biosphere accomplished this really wasn’t completely known. We did know for over 100 years though that the best agricultural soils in the world were found under grasslands/savannas and/or open woodlands where the sun reached the understory of grasses. Those soils being so saturated with carbon they were black and fertile very deep despite no one ever fertilizing them.Mollic Epipedon - SpringerFor that reason these were the prime agricultural lands. And agriculture basically degrades them in almost every case.Land Degradation: An overviewOnly 60 Years of Farming Left If Soil Degradation ContinuesClimate and Land Degradation — an OverviewSo the only known solution was simply to add fertilizers while still farming them, and when they degraded too far, let them go fallow. No one really knew how to farm without fertilisers and restore the soil naturally. Even most the organic farmers were heavily reliant on manure and compost inputs and fallow rotations to keep yields up. And lets face it, any solution to climate change involving soil carbon by necessity must equal or improve yields of food over green revolution industrialised agriculture. Lowering yields with our current growing population just won’t work. There just isn’t enough land left because most the land suitable for agriculture already is in agriculture.Farming Claims Almost Half Earth's Land, New Maps ShowIf we started degrading what is left we would basically leave no room at all for any wildlife! The whole biosphere could collapse and everyone dies if that happens!""The first duty of the agriculturalist must always be to understand that he is part of nature and can not escape from his environment."" - Sir Albert HowardSo it’s been a tough problem to solve. Some have said impossible.Fortunately, there are some stubborn scientists and farmers who regard “impossible” as a nothing more than a challenge to prove it is possible! It’s still unrecognised by the accepted mainstream, but with recent advancements in biological sciences and agricultural methods, it can no longer be called impossible. For the first time in human history we know how to restore degraded land while continuously improving agricultural yields at the same time! And low and behold, it just so happens it involves the other side of the carbon cycle! Coincidence?Currently the atmosphere and ocean have too much carbon while soils have lost carbon at an alarming rate due to development, conversion of native grasslands and forests to cropland, and agricultural practices that decrease soil organic matter.-Daniel KaneTurns out there is more carbon missing from our soils worldwide than the additional carbon in the atmosphere since the beginning of the industrial age. That means almost accidently, those stubborn scientists and farmers that found out how to solve the agricultural dilemma, actually figured out how to solve AGW too. Solve one, you solve both. There are still a few minor gaps with certain crops. But the principle is sound and the gaps are small enough that they don’t prevent action or end result. We still need to reduce emissions by converting to ..."
how should ask my crush for her number	what should i ask my crush	0	"Asking for a girl's number is the easiest part of the dating process. There's no special instructions necessary. I've literally written down ""Can I have your number?"" on a piece of paper and slid it over to my crush at the time and got her number. I've still got that piece of paper years and years later. You might think you need to make some kind of punch line or charm her into giving you her number but that is not the case. It's a very simple yes or no procedure and my Godbrother always advised talking as least as possible prior to getting the number, because you can talk a lot after you get the number. A simple compliment about a specific characteristic or specific part of her appearance (i.e. You're funny or You have beautiful eyes) and then go ahead and tell her you want to get to know her better and then ask for her number. If you get the number, thank her and then tell her you'll call her later and then disappear. You've been successful and there's no need to mess a good thing up so disappear and prepare yourself for the call you're going to make later. In the case that she doesn't want to give out her number, apologize for wasting her time and be off. Understand she has the choice to reject your approach and take it like a man. Don't have a temper tantrum like you're 4 years old. Let that fantasy go and keep it moving. "	Why not? But you are taking a risk asking her out if she doesn’t feel the same way about you. So what?

why do i believe that gravitation force exist	does gravitational force exists in all planets	0	"No need to believe on anything… First you theorize that then do some experiments to confirm your theory. Science simply doesn’t work with believes. I remember a dialogue form movie “The Theory Of Everything”. Jane; “You've never said why you don't believe in God?Hawking; ""A physicist can't allow his calculations to be muddled by belief in a supernatural creator,""so just be skeptic and fine your answer… You don’t even need to believe that earth is almost ellipsoid, whatever bothers you find yourself.cheers!"	Gravity exists everywhere. Its strength depends on mass, so on a small planetoid like the Moon it’s only 1/6 of its value on Earth.I see most people refer to it as a force. My physics professor was always very careful to avoid calling it any such thing, and taught us always to refer to it as “the acceleration due to gravity”, which in fact is what it is. An acceleration. How can this be, I hear you ask, when gravity is experienced by stationary objects. Well - there are no stationary objects in our 4 dimensional Universe. Everything is moving in the direction time at the speed of light, according to Einstein. So when we find ourselves in the presence of mass, which distorts space-time, we’re obliged to follow a curved path, and the effect we feel is what is commonly called “centrifugal force”. It’s not actually a force - it’s an inertial effect. That’s why it’s never been “unified” with the other three fundamental forces, and in my opinion never can be.Epic study confirms Einstein on space-time vortex around Earth | EarthSky.org
can congress stop presidents from starting a major war	what  a good source to purchase attorneys email addresses thanks	0	As has been stated earlier the War Powers Act of 1973 puts limits on the POTUS for prolonged military conflict. This was a direct response to our involvement in Viet Nam. However, because Congress is mostly made up of useless meatbags, they have never used this authority. Congress issues an Authorization to Use Military Force (AUMF) when POTUS asks for their assent to his actions. This is supposed to lay out the objective and parameters to prosecute the conflict.We are still using the most recent AUMF passed in 2003 to justify actions in Libya, Iraq, Syria, Yemen. The list goes on. President Obama inherited this AUMF which is written so broadly so as to justify virtually anything. Sacks of Potatoes (Congress) was urging (whining at) POTUS to change strategy in the Global War on Terror. POTUS then asked for an updated AUMF in order to comply with the wishes of Smart as a Bag of Hammers (Congress).Unsurprisingly, Useless as screen doors on Submarines (Congress) was unable to create a new AUMF that satisfied their demands. Their demands were essentially “do what you’re doing but do it different and better.” POTUS nodded and backed away slowly so as not to induce a seizure in tits on a bull (Congress)So yes they have the power. They are just afraid to use it.I hope insulting Congress (scratch-spit) is not a violation of BNBR. I apologize to any meatbags, potatoes, hammers, screen doors or bulls I may have offended.	Hey! Thanks for your question.This kind of marketing evolves the creation of lead generation campaigns, which mean ways to get people to know your product/service via outbound/inbound methods.Many people ask me how to generate leads properly, and the answer is that there are many different ways and approaches to do that. In any specific case we need to study on how your company’s target answers to each strategy and use the most cost-effective one.Obviously, during the time I’ve worked with lead generation and marketing, I’ve seen some patterns and answers being formed.Although many waves might be showing Inbound Marketing, it must be matched with Outbound strategies in order to get the most of your leads. Cold prospecting is a very effective strategy that you can use, and with the current tools, you can match it with social media, PR and even websites.One tool I find particularly good for it is The simplest tool for prospecting, it’s really handy because it works with many social medias and I can access it straight from my Gmail inbox. It works with credits, so you basically just have to use them as you find new people, so you can easily control how many new leads you’re finding.The best of it is that their software works in real time, which is more than awesome for PR prospecting. After you find your people, the software itself helps you with email sending and the next steps of prospecting.For social media, have a look at Twitter, LinkedIn, and even your target’s website, in any case, their software is useful to predict people’s contact information and saves time with prospecting.Just to make sure you got the idea, the step-by-step is:Build your prospects list;Let the software find their emails;Create your follow-up sequences;Manage replies as you see your clients list growing.I hope this answer was helpful!
is it safe to lose 25 pounds in 1 month	is it healthy to lose 13 pounds in a month	0	Hi, last I heard, which admittedly was quite awhile ago, was that the most you could supposedly safely lose was ~2.5lbs/week. A solid diet, with proper portion control and some exercise will be your friend. (so they say)I was actually diagnosed with diabetes this past Feb. I was introduced to a book called Smart Blood Sugar (best $27 I ever spent!), by Marlene Merritt out of Austin, TX. She’s an MSN nutritionist, as well as, licensed by the State of Texas as a Dr. of Chinese Medicine. The book is really more of a booklet, than a whole book, as it’s less than 60 pages long and maybe 8″ tall x 5 1/2 - 6″ wide. At any rate, she teaches in the book that if you eat 60 grams/day or less your blood sugar will stay with in normal ranges and you will almost certainly not develop diabetes. However, if you HAVE diabetes, by eating the way she recommends in the book, (which I do) almost anyone can get their Type II Diabetes under control and most will not have to take medicine (ie: metformin and/or insulin) to control it. The day I was diagnosed, my A1C was 10.8% and my blood sugar was 385. I immediately started eating the way she describes in her book and in 1 1/2 months my blood sugar was back into normal range, at 3 months, my A1C was down to 6.2%. Now, in Aug., I’ve been eating this way since the first part of March 2016, and I’ve lost 28 or 29 lbs. Carbs are NOT your friend! Try checking out the provided link. You DON’T have to have diabetes to eat healthy. And eating healthy is REALLY what this book is about! Lose the carbs . . . lose the weight! :-) hope this helps!	Here are some tips you can follow:Start off with talking good diet, add green vegetables and fruits to your daily routine diet. Diet is the key factor when it comes to losing weight, so get the grip of the most significant factor first.Next up, you can start following a workout routine, by workout routine it doesn’t mean you start lifting heavy weights, weight lifting is also a wise idea but just to get the ball rolling, take a start with some cardio exercises such as running, jogging, sprinting or swimming. With the course of time you can add on different exercises as it will only do good and no harm.Sleep is also very important in order to keep your body healthy and active. Once you are on the verge of weight loss, you need to make sure that you are doing every possible thing to keep your body as active as possible because you would need some extra energy to perform workout and other daily routine activities. Take sufficient amount of sleep at least 6 to 8 hours daily.Water intake must be consistent. Consume as much amount of water as possible. Water have 0 calories, so it won’t harm in any way instead consumption of water in good amount will aid in weight loss as it will keep the body detoxified and hydrated.If you can manage sometime of your daily routine, try practicing some other well renowned techniques such as meditation and yoga.So you see things are fairly simple but certainly requires some dedication and consistency. Try to cope with your instinct for a while and with the passage of time things will become easier.Looking for Healthy Weight Loss? Red Tea Detox Can be an Option
what are some cute shounen ai series	when will the pok nonascii mon series end	0	Well, the most recent shounen-ai to be really impressive is Yuri on Ice!! The season is finished for that one now, so you won’t have to wait for next week to see the next episode. Possibly the best writing in any romance anime, but especially in any shounen-ai anime, has to be Junjou Romantica. There was a series called Love Stage!! that came out a couple of seasons back that was quite cute. Then, of course, there are the classics: Gravitation, Loveless, Mirage of Blaze, Descendants of Darkness, & Gakuen Heaven. Mirage of Blaze & Descendants are also known as Honoo no Mirage & Yami no Matsuei.	"Lets hope it doesn't. I would certainly want my kids to fall in love with Pikachu probably in the next 10 years or so when i get married :-P , instead of watching ""The Filth"" that they air in CN nowadays and call it as ""Cartoon""(esp in India).Right now they are airing Pokemon Black and White series in CN. But as we all know the games Pokemon X and Y were released last year and hope they turn it into a TV series soon.Even my mom loves Pikachu and keeps making the ""Pika-Pika"" sound whenever I watch it :-D , and I bet many people still watch it but don't reveal that they love those cute little Pocket Monsters. I wish I had a personal Pokemon, and I know many of us secretly wish the same.My favourite like many of you is Charizard. What's yours?Thanks for the A2A."
why are police lights red and blue	why are police lights red andor blue	1	The real reason in the USA that Police use Red and Blue is convention. Blue generally represents Law Enforcement and Red lights are for Emergency Use only by law. A person can’t by law, put flashing red or blue lights on their personal vehicle for this reason. This is why you see yellow (the next most visible color) on Tow Trucks etc, or anyone who has a vehicle for business etc that needs extra visibility in traffic.The wavelengths of the colors etc were not taken into consideration when deciding what colors to use..just convention and tradition. There are different local conventions as well. For example for years the Michigan State Police only used 1 solitary Red light on all of their police vehicles. They still have the one red light but it is supplemented with additional light bars for safety today. Where I was a Fireman in Edwardsville Illinois the Fire used Red and white and the Police used Blue and White light bars.	The real reason in the USA that Police use Red and Blue is convention.

who owns nature	who owns natural factors	0	Very interesting question. Don’t know that I have the answer. Actually, I’m sure I don’t have the answer. That’s one of those questions that even if you got the correct answer, you wouldn’t know if that really was it or not. So, maybe it doesn’t even pay to ask some questions, unless it’s simply for mind stimulation instead of an actual answer. Part of me says we all own nature. We basically control that little space, that little part of nature that surrounds us at any given moment. We have opportunities to enjoy it at every turn. If we have the freedom to do that, then it really doesn’t matter who owns it, unless you’d just like to know so you could thank them for allowing you to experience it. Legally, I reckon recognized land owners own and control the nature on their property, to the extent, of course, that it doesn’t interfere with someone else’s property. But there’s enough public lands that are available to the general public for anyone to enjoy a lifetime of nature, if they so chose. Maybe no one owns it. Some people just assume control of it and pay the fee to use it to whom ever claims to own it in the first place. Most land was stolen at least once somewhere back in time, so that throws a whole other wrench in your monkey. We own nature. All of us, together as one living organism. Every breath everyone of us takes gets blown out into the same air that we all breath. The trees of nature sucks up all our breaths and filters it, pumping it back out for us to breathe anew, with every breath. We are one living being and whatever happens to the least of us happens to all of us. A healthy us makes a healthy nature. Nature is for all of us, unless one is imprisoned or suffocated and kept apart from nature, then they have their own nature and they own it. You own your own nature and you are responsible for it. Just make sure you enjoy your share and make sure you go vote.	It's still majority privately owned in Canada.  In my professional experience, very high quality formulations, manufacturing facilities and an excellent approach to marketing.
how can i install obbdata file on an android	i want to install exe extension files in android mobile is it possible	0	Right here we will make you discuss that how you can easily install with the OBB/data file on the android! Most often of all as we talk about the OBB file, then you are not much aware of this fact. If you are in search of the OBB file, then it is much important for the side of the people to know additional about it as well. Visit to know more about Installing A OBB Data File on Your Android Device; How can I install OBB/data file on an Android?	"Both No and yes, you can but you still can't. Let me tell you why, android is Linux an not windows, it uses java and not .net framework or c+ to work, compile and recompile, so as  a fellow person answered, android is programmed to open APK files and not EXE (executable Files).Yes, you can do it - make a EXE run on Android, use emulators- search For ""Windows Emulators for android"" and you can play with all the EXE files you want to, but note well that some of them won't work because of hardware limitations or limitations in the code of the emulator you are using.And you can do the reverse thing also, like you can run APK's on Windows using YOUWAVE or BLUESTACK, both of them are android emulators.Thanks for asking me to answer it. :)"
what is garbage value and why do we get garbage value in c	what is garbage value in c	0	"Good question. When you say variables declared insude the main() function, these are local variables. They are destroyed when the function finishes it execution. All local variables are stored in the stack. I hope you know what a stack is. Before a function begins execution, details like function arguments, return address, local variables, etc is pushed onto the stack. When the function finishes execution, its popped off the stack.Let's consider 3 functions f1, f2 and f3. First f1 gets called, and is pushed onto the stack. Now f1 calls f2, and f2 is pushed onto the stack. The stack now contains f2 and f1. After f2 finishes its execution, its popped off the stack. Now f1 calls f3, and f3 is pushed onto the stack. The stack now contains f3 and f1. But f3 is stored in the exact location of where f2 was stored earlier. Since the memory is not cleared before pushing f3, we get what we call ""garbage value"", which is actually the data used for f2.The varibales that are declared outside with global scope and not initialized are stored in BSS segment (.bss). The variables stored in BSS are reset to 0. This is actually an optimization done by the compiler to save memory. These variables can simply be mapped to the zero page, and hence do not need to be stored in the binary. These variables shall be allocated space at run time by the loader, just before the variables are used.Thus its mentioned in the C standard. All static and global variables must be initialized before the program starts. If the  programmer didn't do this explicitly, then the compiler must set them to  zero. If the compiler doesn't do this, it doesn't follow standard C."	"It's generally a term meaning that the value in that variable doesn't have some sort of planned meaning. I.e. when the variable was declared (i.e. the compiled program allocated space in RAM to hold a value for that variable) nothing was placed there. So whatever was previously in that spot in RAM is now the value.Something like this:#include <stdio.h>int main(void) {	int my_int;	my_int = my_int + 1000;	printf(""%d"", my_int);	return 0;}Just what is in that my_int variable? It might be 0, then again it might be a portion of a string which was in the html of the web page you last viewed, or it could be a set of bytes from a program which was last executed, or anything which was previously in that spot in RAM. The C compiler (usually) just builds a program which takes the raw bits in that spot and interprets them as an integer (because of the int type specifier), it doesn't clear anything, it doesn't set anything, it only allocates the RAM which was free before it ran.This is also referred to (more correctly) as non-initialized values. Because the most common way to avoid this is to initialize a variable with a value when declaring it. Or at least set it to something prior to making use of its value. I.e. rather than leaving it as is, you'd do something like this:#include int main(void) {	int my_int = 0;	my_int = my_int + 1000;	printf(""%d"", my_int);	return 0;}At least now you ""know"" that the value starts off as 0.Similar stuff happens with other types of variables. E.g. an array of ints is also such non-initialized values. Worse, a variable as a pointer means it may very easily point to somewhere which is impossible (e.g. beyond the available RAM). So in nearly all cases it's a very good idea to initialize your variables as soon as possible, you may leave it till a bit later in some very select cases where you want to optimize, but there's extremely few cases where you'd never initialize.You can set some command switches in some C compilers which would auto-initialize such variables for you, but you should not need to rely on that. Some other languages guarantee that they auto-initialize to some default values (usually 0), but C is not one of them."

what is the difference between a comet and an asteroid	what is the difference between asteroids and comets	1	Asteroids and comets have a few things in common. They are both celestial bodies orbiting our Sun, and they both can have unusual orbits, sometimes straying close to Earth or the other planets. They are both “leftovers” — made from materials from the formation of our Solar System 4.5 billion years ago. But there are a few notable differences between these two objects, as well.The main difference between asteroids and comets is their composition, as in, what they are made of. Asteroids are made up of metals and rocky material, while comets are made up of ice, dust and rocky material. Asteroids formed much closer to the Sun, where it was too warm for ices to remain solid. Comets formed farther from the Sun where ices would not melt. Comets which approach the Sun lose material with each orbit because some of their ice melts and vaporizes to form a tail.Right now, the majority of asteroids reside in the asteroid belt, a region between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter which may hold millions of space rocks of varying sizes.On the other hand, the majority of comets are in the farthest reaches of our Solar System: either 1. in the Kuiper Belt — a region just outside the orbit of the dwarf planet Pluto that may have millions of icy comets (as well as many icy dwarf planets like Pluto and Eris); or 2. the Oort Cloud, a region where trillions of comets may circle the Sun at huge distances of up to 20 trillion kilometers (13 trillion miles).The Kuiper BeltThe Oort Cloud.	Asteriods and Comets are both celestial bodies orbiting the Sun. The main difference between the two is their composition, i.e, the stuff they are made of. An asteroid is made of rocky material and metals, where as a comet is made of ice, dust and small rocks.Asteriods are formed much closer to the Sun. The temperature around the Sun makes it too warm for ice to remain solid.Whereas comets are formed farther from the Sun where ice won’t melt.Asteroids typically remain much more solid and self-contained, even when near the Sun.Comets, while approaching the Sun, lose material with each orbit because some of their ice melts and vaporizes to form a tail, which asteroids don’t have.Another difference between comets and asteroids are the path they take or orbital patterns. Comets tend to have extended and elongated orbits, many times going more than 50,000 AU from the sun (1 AU, or astronomical unit, equals the distance from the Earth to the Sun). Asteroids tend to have shorter, more circular orbits and group together in belts than comets.Comet.Asteroid

That logo will be seen league-wide on all fields as part of the NFL's ""welcome back to football"" campaign.

Columns of antique ruins in center and as it seems an antique temple in the back. Plus in the front a goat and some sheep? A typical European  picturesque landscape painting: 19th Century Landscape - The Pastoral, the Picturesque and the Sublime - The University of Arizona Museum of Art and Archive of Visual Arts.For to be painted in Italy the ruins combined with the snowy mountain in the back is a little bit strange. I have no idea where it could have been painted. Definitely not in southern Italy nor near Rome. Maybe it is a fantasy landscape? Anyway it doesn't look that well done and it's badly damaged in the center.The painter could be Italian, but German or British as well. Since Johann Wolfgang Goethe wrote his Italian Journey, Italy was the land of dreams for German painters.

what  beyond our universe	if space is expanding where does the new space come from	0	If the universe is expanding, then what does it expand into? What do we call that space which accommodates the expanding universe?	New space ‘emanates’ from all massive particles at the speed of light. What we see as a constant value, c, exists as a constant because photons exist in a state(s) allowing them to travel on the expanding wave front of space/time from all massive particles, synchronized across the universe by the ‘creative’ phenomenon we name the ‘Big Bang’. [e.g. When a photon is emanated by the sun, it expands on the wave front of the sun’s space/time emanations. When it reflects off of the moon, it is expanding on the wave front of the moon’s mass. When it is created by an explosion of mass / energy (equivalent, essentially) and reflects off a tiny particle, it moves on the wave front of this mass’s emanations and then the tiny particle’s emanations.]The source of this space/time emanation is temporal in nature. The crux of the explanation is that the big bang is not a distinct event that created the universe, but instead a continuously occurring and simultaneous phenomenon. The energy (infinite by our standards or nothing could exist), released in the big bang is continuously/simultaneously restructuring itself into the infinite pantheon of everything that exists in momentary memory.Instead of an answer, I have posed a possible solution, because nobody really knows the correct answer to this. I have been looking for the answer to this and a few other questions (such as why does gravity exist and what is its nature?) for nearly two decades with no answers forthcoming that do not make fundamental assumptions that something simply is, and has to be because the equation doesn’t make sense otherwise.Exploring this is imperative for our understanding of physics to advance in a major way. It is my belief that our understanding of multiple dimensions would be flipped upside down by a more accurate theory with which to frame this question that accounts for dynamic dimensional flow instead of simply various dimensional geometries. None of the answers have truly addressed this, and the Higgs Boson solution or other quantum explanations may be the closest model approximations we have yet conceptualized that are accepted by mainstream physics. My belief is that this is tied intricately into the question, where does gravity come from and why does it draw masses together (a wave-like cancellation of the ‘expanding’ space/time wave front between two masses that is ‘stronger’ as the masses draw closer or are more massive)? Also, why is there a maximum light speed? Or, rather, why do particles get more massive as they accelerate towards light speed?
is growing of hair a physical or a chemical change	can a bald person ever grow their hair back	0	Can hair structure change?Yes, hair structure can be changed with chemical texture services which cause a chemical change.Image of the Parts Of Human Hair - Henry Gray (1918) Anatomy of the Human Body - Bartleby.com: Gray's Anatomy, Plate 945The chemical change permanently alters the natural wave pattern of the hair, until the hair grows back at the root.Chemical hair services can be used to retexturize curl as well as add volume to straight hair. It can also straighten overly curly hair, or soften coarse, straight hair.Chemical texture services applied to the hair can make it much more pliable and easier to style.Texture hair services include, but aren’t necessarily limited to the following:permanent waving (known as perms)chemical straightening (removing all texture)soft curl perms (adding soft curls to straight hair)curl re-forming (restructuring natural curls)chemical hair relaxing (softening natural texture)All hair texture services are constantly being improved by new discoveries, and advancements.Each distinct chemical texture service may use different chemical formulations. They also may have different objectives or a different list of steps and/or procedures.All texture services involve chemical and physical changes within the structure of the hair.Hair And How Chemicals Can Change The Hair’s StructureThe major layers of the hair, starting from the outside working inward include:The Cuticle - This is the tough outer layer of hair which surrounds the inner layers and protects hair from damage.If someone has a strong compact cuticle layer, it makes the hair more resistant. This basically means that the hair resists penetration, When hair is persistent, it is more difficult to treat and service.The cuticle is not directly involved in chemical texture services. However, the chemicals must be able to penetrate through the cuticle in order to be effective.Chemical hair texturizers offer the ability to change the hair’s natural curl pattern.Alkaline chemical solutions soften and swell the hair, raising the cuticle and thereby permitting the solution to penetrate through the cuticle to its target within the cortex.Coarse, resistant hair with a strong compact cuticle layer requires a texturizer which is highly alkaline (high pH). a less alkaline (lower pH) solution is more suited to porous, damaged, or chemically treated hair.The CortexThe middle layer of the hair located directly beneath the cuticle is known as the cortex.The polypeptide chains of the cortex are connected by end bonds and cross-linked by side bonds which form the fibers and structure of hair.These chemical bonds hold the hair in its natural wave pattern and are responsible for the incredible strength and elasticity of human hair.Breaking the side-bands of the cortex makes it possible to change the natural wave pattern of the hair.Peptide Bonds (End Bonds)The chemical bonds which join the amino acids are called peptide bonds or end bonds.Peptide ChainsThe peptide bonds, in turn, link together to form long chains of amino acids called polypeptide chains.Proteins are long, coiled complex polypeptide chains made of different amino acids linked together, end to end, like an old-fashioned pop bead chain.It’s important to note that peptide bonds should not be broken during any salon service.Breaking the peptide bonds in the hair causes the polypeptide chains to come apart and dramatically weakens the hair.If used incorrectly, chemical hair texturizers can break peptide bonds and cause major hair breakage.Chemical hair texturizers must be used with care.Side BondsThe cortex is made of millions of polypeptide chains cross-lined by three types of side bonds of cross bonds:disulfide bondssalt bondshydrogen bondsDisulfide BondsThe chemical and physical changes in disulfide bonds make permanent waving, soft curl permanents (curl re-forming) and chemical hair relaxing pos...	Baldness is also called as alopecia or male pattern baldness. Male pattern baldness is caused because of genetics and hormones. If anyone in your family upto 4 generations on mothers or fathers side, then chances are that you will get baldness too.Male pattern baldness starts at the front on angles of hairline and in crown area. It slowly spreads to make the entire top of head bald.Prevention of baldness can be done in early stages of hair loss by regular use of minoxidil and finasteride.If the baldness is in very early stages with presence of small baby hair on head then hair regrowth therapy may work. It includes a combination of medicines and PRP therapy. Remember hair regrowth therapy is not a pne time procedure. It needs to taken continuously indefinitely. Despite regular use, regrowth is not guaranteed.But if baldness is in advanced stages then hair regrowth therapy may not work. Hair transplant remains the only natural and permanent option here. Hair transplant treatment includes taking hair from the back of head or beard or other parts of body and implanting them at bald areas. Sonce it is your own hair, they will remain lifelong and do not require long term of maintenance. It is a completely safe procedure. It helps in changing the looks of a person completely. Nowadays the technology is very advanced and hair transplant is possible without visible scarring.Other ways of treating baldness are artificial biofibres hair implant, scalp micropigmentation or wigs and hair bonding. All these techniques need long term maintenance and reapeated expenditure.For best advise on hair loss treatment and baldness treatment visit www.primehairstudio.com.
what is the difference between culture and history	how is chili different between cultures	0	I look at culture almost as a nation's DNA.  It doesn't change much over time and expresses itself in everything from how people relate to each other, how they eat, what they value.History is how a culture traverses time.  The German culture, for instance, is very old but the history of Germany as a nation begins in 1871.  We know that Germany fought two world wars, was spit, reunited, had an economic wonder.  Just as environment can have an impact on DNA, national history will impact national culture.  For Germans it affects the ability to be openly patriotic, to embrace military solutions.	Being Chinese, once I interviewed my Japanese coworkers who work in China,“What Chinese cuisine do you DISLIKE the most?”I asked this question because all of them have been constantly telling me they love love love Chinese food. When I asked them which cuisine is their favorite, they gave me an unbelievable long list. But, the thing is, 99.99999% Japanese people are freakishly polite, especially when they are your coworkers (which means, you can easily know what they like, but you can hardly know what they dislike). So I was deadly eager to hear their real voice.From 20+ coworkers, I got a ‘The Worst Chinese Cuisine For Japanese’ rank. And the No.1 totally shocked me.The steamed freshwater fish.There are lots of ways to cook fish in China. And steaming is commonly considered as the most authentic way, because you only put the scallion and ginger slice, light soy sauce in, steam shortly, without heavy cooking, to keep the original flavor of the fish as possible. It also means you can only make this dish with 100% fresh fish. In inland regions, people usually use freshwater fish to cook it because those are fish they can buy living from the tanks of morning markets or supermarkets. It’s also a gorgeous and expensive cuisine in high-end restaurants. Generous Chinese hosts like to order it for their VIP guests.But my coworkers hated it, despite that they tried hard to pretend to enjoy it for politeness.The reason?The fishy taste of ‘freshwater fish’. Most Japanese people eat mostly sea fish, hence their tongues are unfamiliar with the taste of freshwater fish, hence ‘fishy’. (Likewise, lots of my inland Chinese relatives who are rarely exposed to seafood say sea fish tastes ‘fishy’.) Some of my Japanese coworkers got shocked by knowing carp is a common dish too in China which they considered as ‘inedible’.Too many bones. ‘Putting something into your mouth then spitting part of it out’ is considered a no-no in Japanese table manner. So most cuisines in Japan are prepared bone-less. In the case bones are unavoidable, they tend to use the sharp chopstick tips to neatly remove the bones before putting into their mouths. There is no such a table manner in China. In a typical Chinese restaurant, a small plate is placed in front of each person. People freely spit out bones, nut shells, fruit seeds etc onto them. Waiters frequently replace them with clean plates. Most steamed freshwater fish have far too many bones to remove by chopsticks. This is a typical Chinese cuisine which is designed to ‘use your mouth and achieve your food’, which, apparently became ‘a pain in the ass’ to my poor coworkers who grew up in another food culture.‘I just can’t stand making eye contact with a fish to be eaten.’ Well, enough said.(Side note: Interestingly, 100% of my Japanese coworkers fell in love with Yangcheng hairy crabs, or in Japanese language, ‘Shanghai crab’, despite the facts they are from freshwater, they have countless bones which costs you a great effort to remove by mouth, and, their tiny eyes occasionally make contact with you too…)Lots of ‘weird food’ are on the rank, such as duck’s tongues. Apparently my coworkers are not particularly into French kissing ducks.Frogs.Snakes.They don’t hate the taste. They hate the awareness they know what they are eating- things which are considered ‘inedible’ in their culture.Different food cultures not only make ‘dislikes’, they make ‘likes’ too.My Japanese coworkers have a consensus:The best beef is in Japan. The best pork is in China.They make love with different, creative and diverse Chinese pork cuisines.Braised pork with brown sauce is one of their ‘must order dishes’.Sometimes Japanese coworkers who are karato (spicy food lovers) would suggest to eat hot hot Hunan cuisine. And every time, the first disappeared cuisine is this one- West Hunan chili fried pork.And their favorite Shanghai dim sum is ...
what does it mean when a guy says i like you	what does it mean when a guy says be safe	0	Men are usually more straight forward, than women. If a guy says he likes you, he most likely does. If you want to know if he likes you more for your body, or your soul, you can usually tell by where he looks when he is talking to you. The more he looks you in the eyes when he is talking to you, the more he likes you for your soul. The more he likes you for your body, the more he'll look at your boobs when he's talking to you. Despite most women's insistence that romance is everything, in my experience, there has to be a cirtian amount of carnal attraction, to keep a spark for any length of time. I'd say a healthy ammount of him looking at your boobs, would be 1/4 to 1/3 of the time. If he looks at your boobs more than that, he doesn't respect you as much as he wants to ravish you. If he looks at your boobs less than that, his sex drive is probably low.	Let me just compose a bit of dialogue here to help us visualize the situation in which this is commonly used.”Hey, I’m going out with Sam and some other friends tonight.””Alright, be safe.”As basic as that example was, ‘be safe’ has several meanings here. It literally means be safe, but it also implies that we care about your well being. Be safe would include things like not driving while under the influence, wearing a seatbelt, not walking in dark alleys alone at night. It’s not an insult, just a way to show that we care.
what makes a programmer good	what makes a good programmer great	1	The skill of being able to see and live day in the life of someone else.Given all the massively technical answers on parade, I have to disagree with the mass majority of them.Most things today are written for you.

Yes, some solve it faster, some slower, but computation is this: scale.

which european country is the best for asylum seekers	what are the best countries for whistleblowers to seek asylum	0	Seeking asylum is a specific process to get protection from individual persecution. Asylum seekers should apply for asylum in the first safe country — not think about what the “best” country for asylum is.The top answer of the question is a good example for what’s wrong with the perception of asylum. “My favorite [country for asylum seekers] is Sweden”. As asylum seekers are a burden to the host country (at least financially), this logic basically punishes countries who are open and hospitable for asylum seekers by “recommending” it for additional asylum seekers.This way of speaking about asylum ultimately is bad for asylum seekers in the long-term, because it softens up the originally very specific definitions of seeking asylum (from individual persecution) or seeking refuge (from hopefully temporary turmoil from natural catastrophes or war).For example, in Germany just 1% of the applicants for asylum are granted asylum. The others are either former refugees (e.g. from Syria or Iraq) or just economic migrants who try to use the asylum process to get residence in a rich European country.A person who is individually persecuted should try to get to a safe country with a stable asylum process. The first such country they enter, they should apply for asylum.A refugee from civil war should seek the next safe shelter. In the case of Syria, this would have been refugee camps in Lebanon, Turkey or Jordan. The living conditions in these camps are not ideal (and should be improved by rich countries), but if you then decide to migrate from these camps to another country, you’re not a refugee anymore. If you cross Turkey, Greece, Austria to get to Germany, you’re not a refugee. Any of these places have been safe.An economic migrant should use legal processes to apply for migration. Which will often be impossible for uneducated migrants from poor countries. Then still coming to Europe and “apply for asylum” is basically abusing the system. They know that in practice, many economic migrants are either not identified as such, or even if they are, they are not sent home for a plethora of reasons. But still, they’re abusing a system designed to help individually persecuted people, and thus reducing the long-term sustainability of this system.Now, of course the motivations of economic migrants, or Syrian refugees in the safety of Turkey, to move on to a rich European country, are understandable. Possibly, I’d try the same if it were made easy to me. But I believe it should be clearly dis-incentivized, so that less economic migrants or former refugees take dangerous and illegal measures to improve their living conditions.	"I don't know what life is like as a whistleblower anywhere else, but I can tell you quite a bit about what my life as a bank whistleblower living in the United States has been like...When I left Bank of America, they went on an immediate smear campaign against me I was not prepared for, with their corporate security team calling the Chandler, AZ police department to report a bomb threat on my facebook page. In my blog, The Night My Whole Life Changed... I described what happened the night the police surrounded my house in front of all my neighbors and accused me of calling in a bomb threat.I was calm and intelligent enough to stay out of jail, but I had been effectively blacklisted, and while I filled out paperwork to obtain unemployment and other government assistance, the bank was hard at work sending adjusted income forms to the IRS and collecting any and all information they could on me.The only reason I was able to survive any of this long enough to speak to a regulator (at the time, the State Attorneys General Coalition, who was pursuing the largest bank settlement to come out of the housing crisis) is because I went public via Anonymous and the internet. If not for Anonymous and the internet, I would be dead like the countless other whistleblowers who make ""Whistleblower found dead"" the top auto-fill suggestion on Google.Not only did speaking to the Attorneys General Coalition not affect anything, but I found myself with nothing. Nearly everyone around me cut me off as I was no longer climbing the ladder with them; I was now labeled a problem...a snitch...a whistleblower...It was while laying on rock bottom, on the precipice of overdosing on spice (synthetic marijuana that was ironically legal in AZ at the time), losing my house, my car, and my entire world that I pondered how this could happen to a man whose only crime was in telling the truth. I realized for every Bradley Manning we hear about, there are thousands who were silenced. That's the thought that led to me building my blog and becoming a writer.As a free man who blew the whistle on a civilian corporation in the United States (the supposed beacon of human freedom), I would say the only safe place to seek asylum is on the internet...that's where I've been hiding...Brian Penny"
where and how do the crop circles get generated	what are crop circles	1	‘How often have I said to you that when you have eliminated the impossible, whatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth?’ (Sherlock Holmes)In this case though he would want to prove the “guilty” to be innocent: It’s so easy to wait for an uncommon event to rev up the spotlights of attention and then step forward and bask in the limelight. And because these events are a little more uncommon than even the media cares for, they eagerly and uncritically jump to the first relief coming their way: a normal human being taking responsibility. Great, we can go back to sleep! But Sherlock isn’t that easily satisfied with shallow claims.This mandala appeared 1990 carved in the hard bottom of a desert lake in Oregon and comprised a total of 13 miles of 10″ wide furrows dug 3″deep. Lieutenant Bill Miller of the 190th Tactical Reconnaissance Squadron reported the details of what he had spotted to the authorities at the Air National Guard - “a 13.3 mile glyph of lines about a quarter of a mile square, on the extremely hard, sun-baked dry bed of a lake in Mickey Basin…” These pilots are trained to spot the unusual on a much smaller scale than that and there is no chance they could have missed the ongoing construction of such an image during their regular rounds.Now, here’s the recent account of a then 12 year old who claims to have camped out there for couple weeks helping his dad and a friend creating this perfectly executed pattern. Oregon Land Art (Sri Yantra)“It was really hard work because we didn't use any machines or special surveying equipment.” The challenge wouldn’t be the hard work, it’s the precision layout without compass and ruler and without leaving auxiliary construction lines.“…we had to draw some pretty big lines!” he states, and thus blows his cover: he used the wrong words, the right ones being “dig” and “furrow”, but these words wold immediately solicit the thorny follow-up question: “were did the dug up material go?”“We kept the project anonymous and left no traces of us having been there.” he writes, completely ignoring the fact that 13miles worth of furrows 10″by 3″ will leave you with 400 cubic meters of debris, which means moving and making disappear 600t of desert material. Now, I’ve helped my dad dig a lot of tree pits - in comparatively soft soil - so I have a good, hands on appreciation of what it means to manually move cubic meters of material. They would have collapsed with broken backs not half way into this.“It was really accurate too because small errors are smoothed out as a result of the large scale involved…” Another sign that this guy doesn’t know at all what he’s talking about: Inaccuracies in the underlying geometry and proportionality of any structure will reveal themselves more clearly at a distance. That’s why artists always step back from their canvas to make sure they get it right.Perfectly straight and parallel lines in perfect orthogonality without a guide, perfectly identical ogee shaped curves without a template? Just by walking and pulling a crude plow through hardened mud? It would be a major logistics project with tons of preparation and high tech equipment to pull that off. Yet it is claimed to be the result of a family outing entertainment with only the crudest of tools. Whom are they kidding?It’s amazing how easy it is to hoax the hoaxing, how much nonsense the brain can produce and accept without short circuiting itself.Take Bower and Chorley for instance, who claimed responsibility for most crop circles in England from the mid 70ies to the early 90ies. They claim to have produced, in nightly excursions, intricate geometric patterns with ropes, a simple board and that silly contraption on their cap which is supposed to help them follow a straight line - how exactly? and in the dark of the night when most crop circles appeared?The problem with crop circles in fields is the l...	‘How often have I said to you that when you have eliminated the impossible, whatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth?’ (Sherlock Holmes)In this case though he would want to prove the “guilty” to be innocent: It’s so easy to wait for an uncommon event to rev up the spotlights of attention and then step forward and bask in the limelight.

But Sherlock isn’t that easily satisfied with shallow claims.This mandala appeared 1990 carved in the hard bottom of a desert lake in Oregon and comprised a total of 13 miles of 10″ wide furrows dug 3″deep. Lieutenant Bill Miller of the 190th Tactical Reconnaissance Squadron reported the details of what he had spotted to the authorities at the Air National Guard - “a 13.3 mile glyph of lines about a quarter of a mile square, on the extremely hard, sun-baked dry bed of a lake in Mickey Basin…” These pilots are trained to spot the unusual on a much smaller scale than that and there is no chance they could have missed the ongoing construction of such an image during their regular rounds.Now, here’s the recent account of a then 12 year old who claims to have camped out there for couple weeks helping his dad and a friend creating this perfectly executed pattern. Oregon Land Art (Sri Yantra)“It was really hard work because we didn't use any machines or special surveying equipment.” The challenge wouldn’t be the hard work, it’s the precision layout without compass and ruler and without leaving auxiliary construction lines.“…we had to draw some pretty big lines!” he states, and thus blows his cover: he used the wrong words, the right ones being “dig” and “furrow”, but these words wold immediately solicit the thorny follow-up question: “were did the dug up material go?”“We kept the project anonymous and left no traces of us having been there.” he writes, completely ignoring the fact that 13miles worth of furrows 10″by 3″ will leave you with 400 cubic meters of debris, which means moving and making disappear 600t of desert material. Now, I’ve helped my dad dig a lot of tree pits - in comparatively soft soil - so I have a good, hands on appreciation of what it means to manually move cubic meters of material. They would have collapsed with broken backs not half way into this.“It was really accurate too because small errors are smoothed out as a result of the large scale involved…” Another sign that this guy doesn’t know at all what he’s talking about: Inaccuracies in the underlying geometry and proportionality of any structure will reveal themselves more clearly at a distance. That’s why artists always step back from their canvas to make sure they get it right.Perfectly straight and parallel lines in perfect orthogonality without a guide, perfectly identical ogee shaped curves without a template? Just by walking and pulling a crude plow through hardened mud? It would be a major logistics project with tons of preparation and high tech equipment to pull that off. Yet it is claimed to be the result of a family outing entertainment with only the crudest of tools. Whom are they kidding?It’s amazing how easy it is to hoax the hoaxing, how much nonsense the brain can produce and accept without short circuiting itself.Take Bower and Chorley for instance, who claimed responsibility for most crop circles in England from the mid 70ies to the early 90ies. They claim to have produced, in nightly excursions, intricate geometric patterns with ropes, a simple board and that silly contraption on their cap which is supposed to help them follow a straight line - how exactly? and in the dark of the night when most crop circles appeared?The problem with crop circles in fields is the l...
will baking soda help pass a urine test	how does baking soda help you pass a drug test	1	No. You cleanse methamphetamine (and all other drugs) from your system through enzyme-catalyst reactions at a rate predetermined by your own genetic code. This is commonly referred to as metabolism. There is no scientific, peer-reviewed evidence that suggests there is anything you can ingest to speed this process up, although there is some evidence to suggest that amino acids such as creatine can increase your body's ability to produce more energy for work. Most drug tests do not test for drugs themselves, as they are eliminated rapidly from your blood. Instead, they use antibodies to detect drug metabolites, which are the substances your body breaks the drugs down into. This is why urine drug tests (udt) are the most prevalent among the various testing methods. The metabolites are filtered and stored in the kidneys, and then excreted in the urine. UDTs, therefore,  have reasonably long detection times, yet still avoid the expense involved in hair follicle testing (which increases detection times even further).  Blood testing would tell someone what you might be high on at the moment of the test, but urine testing gives an inquisitor a glimpse into your recent past.If you have a UDT coming up and you fear you will not be clean, your best bet is to drink plenty of water, and exercise to increase your metabolism. A couple of hours before your test, drink enough water so that your urine is clear and very frequent. B complex vitamins will help color it back yellow, and a few table spoons of common table salt may help increase specific gravity in case your sample is sent to a lab for a validity check.  Dilution is the solution to pollution, and a diluted sample is always better than a failure.	Yes indeed it will work. Baking soda will make you pass a urine drug test. probation and parole will not send off your results if you pass because anyone who has experience in that area knows that they arent the ones who test you in the first place. sadly enough i know this to be a fact. my younger sister is on probation and she uses baking soda every time and she passes. she does her drug of choice the day of her test… which i wouldnt suggest. but she goes through dramatic pain in the process.. its insane. she puts a few teaspoons of baking soda into a warm class of four oz glass of water. drinks it quickly, then waits for the upset stomach to come, which doesnt take long at all….. then after shes done with the “shits” she pees once before hand. goes in… and passes. she is sick from the process and is miserable the whole time. also if you throw it up…. you have to make yourself drink the same amount… and keep it down. this method is for all drugs but if you dont want to go through the pain… i would suggest the stuff you make jello with.. someone said the name down below… its at Walmart… and you drink the packets… you can mix it with cool-aid.. NOT CAFFEINE, pee twice then go test.. if you smoke cigs.. or drink any caffeine it will indeed cancel it out. people in the army use the jello stuff to pass when they smoke weed…. it works. yes, get help. but for people that are giving answers and basically BASHING people who have a problem… you should feel sorry for yourself because your no better. having the cocky attitude and heartless heart…. actually makes you worse. people wont get help unless they want it. some have to hit rock bottom to seek it, but at least they do. or most. and the ones that do go get help… change their lives and then have a story and can be proud. they can set examples and help others who have a problem. unlike people who are just cold-hearted… you will always be cold-hearted with a stuck-up attitude that will get you… no friends and if you have friends… they are fake friends… or you have that money to keep them around.. same with your family. or the attitude you have is actually covering up your mental case brain and probably have skeletons in your closet you are to ashamed to face. these people who have a problem do the same thing. but their hearts arent evil.. just whatever the drug they do makes them that way. i see a bunch of answers given that are senseless. ITS COMMON SENSE TO GO GET HELP. if they are looking for an answer to something like this THEY ALREADY KNOW THEY HAVE A PROBLEM.
what is zika virus and how is it transmitted	how is zika virus spread	1	Zika Virus (ZIKV) is mosquito-borne emerging flavivirus which was first identified in Zika Forest of Uganda in 1947 in rhesus monkeys. It was later identified in humans in 1968 for the first time in Nigeria. Different outbreaks of Zika virus disease have been recorded in Africa, the Americas, Asia and the Pacific. Its infection is caused by the bite of an infected Aedes mosquito, usually causing mild fever, rash, conjunctivitis, and muscle pain. In Brazil in May 2015, the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) issued an alert regarding the first confirmed Zika virus infections.Group: Group IV ((+) ssRNA)Family: FlaviviridaeGenus: FlavivirusSpecies: Zika virusStructure of Zika Virus :-The virion is approximately 40 nm in diameter with surface projections that measure roughly 5-10 nm.Nucleocapsid is 25-30 nm in diameter surrounded by a host-membrane derived lipid bilayer.EnvelopedIcosahedralContains envelope proteins E and MGenome of Zika virus :-Non-segmented, single-stranded, positive-sense RNA genome10794 bases long with two non-coding regions flanking regions known as the 5′ NCR and the 3′ NCR.Sign and Symptoms of Zika Virus :-These symptoms are mild and usually last for 2-7 days.HeadacheFeverSkin rashes (exanthema)Pink eyeConjunctivitisMuscle and joint painMalaiseSymptoms are similar to that of dengue or chikungunya.Epidemiology of Zika virus :-The virus was first isolated in 1947 from a rhesus macaque in the Zika Forest of Uganda.It was later identified in humans in 1968 for the first time in NigeriaThe first major outbreak, with 185 confirmed cases, was reported in 2007 in the Yap Islands.The first cases confirmed in Brazil was in May 2015 and the country is currently experiencing the largest epidemic ever recorded with 440,000 to 1,300,000 suspected cases reported by the Brazilian health authorities.There are 3174 cases and 38 deaths from microcephaly in Brazil as of 21 October 2015.There has been total death of 152 as of 21 October 2015 in the world.Affected Countries: Barbados, Bolivia, Brazil, Colombia, the Dominican Republic, Ecuador, El Salvador, French Guiana, Guatemala, Guadeloupe, Guyana, Haiti, Honduras, Martinique, Mexico, Panama, Paraguay, Puerto Rico, Saint Martin, Suriname, and Venezuela.Countries and territories with active Zika virus transmission as of Jan 2016.Source: CDCSince November, Brazil has seen nearly 4,000 cases of microcephaly in babies born to women who were infected with Zika during their pregnancies.Transmission of Zika virus :-Zika virus is transmitted from one people to another through the bite of an infected Aedes mosquito, mainly Aedes aegypti in tropical regions.There has been one report of possible spread of the virus through blood transfusion and one report of possible spread of the virus through sexual contact.In 2015, Zika virus RNA was detected in the amniotic fluid of two fetuses, indicating that it had crossed the placenta and could cause a mother-to-child infection.The Asian tiger mosquito, Aedes albopictus, is also known to transmit the virus, but it is not clear how efficiently.To date, there are no reports of infants getting Zika virus through breastfeeding.Pathogenesis of Zika Virus :-Incubation period in mosquitoes is about 10 days.The vertebrate hosts of the virus are primarily monkeys and humans.The pathogenesis of the virus is hypothesized to start with an infection of dendritic cells near the site of inoculation, followed by a spread to lymph nodes and the bloodstream. Flaviviruses generally replicate in the cytoplasm, but Zika virus antigens have been found in infected cell nuclei.Infection with the virus appears to be linked to the development of unusually small heads and brain damage in newborns (microcephaly). The most dangerous time is thought to be during the first trimester of Pregnancy– when some women do not realize they are pregnant. Experts do not know how the virus enters the placenta and damages the growing brain of the fetus.Diagnosis of Zika Virus:-Sample: Blood, Saliva, Urine.PCR: It is useful in the first 3-5 days after the onset of symptoms. It helps in the direct detection of Zika virus RNA or specific viral antigens in clinical specimens.Serology Test: It detect the presence of antibodies but are useful only after five days.Treatment of Zika Virus:-There is no specific treatment or vaccine currently available.Prevention and Control of Zika Virus:-Avoid travel to areas with an active infestation.Travelers should take the basic precautions to protect themselves from mosquito bites.During outbreaks, health authorities may advise that spraying of insecticides be carried out.Reducing mosquito populations and avoiding bites, which occur mainly during the day.Eliminating and controlling Aedes aegypti mosquito breeding sites reduces the chances that Zika will be transmitted.References:-Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)- Zika Virus.WHO, Media Centre, Fact sheets- Zika virus.Pan American Health Organization- Zika Virus Infection.CNN- Five things you need to know about Zika.CBC Radio Canada- Zika virus: what you need to know.Guardian News and Media Limited- Zika virus: what travellers need to know.The New York Times Company- Short Answers to Hard Questions About Zika Virus.Vox Media, Inc.- Zika virus, explained in 6 charts and maps.Microbeonline- Zika virus: Transmission, Pathogenesis, symptoms and laboratory diagnosis.Wikipedia- Zika virus.

what is the best way to learn algebra by yourself	how do you learn algebra 1 fast	1	Roll up your sleeves and do it.Block out large chunks of time in regular intervals (… a few hours a day, ideally; but whatever your schedule allows). Sit down in a quiet place. Turn off televisions, phones, music, distractions, etc. Get a book(*), read a lesson, do 50 problems drilling the skills of that lesson.Repeat.I put an asterisk on “book,” to clarify that I mean a “book” in a functional sense. Maybe your “book” is electronic, for example. If your book is a website, you have to be very disciplined to not switch to some other site just for a few seconds to check in on something.You can watch videos if you want, and if you feel they’re helpful. But one thing is certain: you will never learn algebra 1 if you don’t do exercises. Ideally, lots of them.The good news is, you can do this in a short time. You can stop reading now if you like, but I’ll finish up with a little story from my education:I switched schools in 8th grade. Unbeknownst to me, the book I used in the first school was basically in the reverse order of the book I used at the next one. That meant I saw half of algebra 1 twice, and didn’t see the other half at all. Worse yet, I didn’t discover this until the final exam: I had no idea about half the stuff. So I got an F in the class.This was scary for me because (a) I knew I wasn’t an F student, and (b) the F meant I’d be placed into “math for dummies” next year. Fortunately, the F came in 8th grade. (For international readers: US colleges only look at your academic record from 9th grade on. So this F wouldn’t hurt me in that way.)In any case, I explained the situation to the 9th grade school administration, and somehow managed to get placed in the advanced math class on the condition I get up to speed on algebra by myself.So I did what I suggested above: over the summer, I worked through the first part of my algebra book. Sometimes I sat down for hours at a time, sometimes just 15–20 minutes a day. But I was relentless.If you can do that, you can learn algebra. In fact, you can learn a lot more.

how does it feel to retake a class in college	does retaking subjects in college affect future job prospects	0	"I want to throw in an opinion as a prof & advisor, as well as some personal reflection.Students mostly fail college courses because the instructor failed them; that is, if you ask the students, that's what they say. Professors say most students fail to put in sufficient time. Who's right? Well, I've never failed a student who didn't know they were failing well before the end of the course, and it was never the first conversation I had with a student. I teach at a very small school that has an expectation of such attention, and I enjoy... when the student turns it around. I have never failed a student who completed all of the assignments, not because I have a policy, but because if you complete the assignments, actually take the exams (yes, students regularly skip exams), and attend class, you're committed enough to do the additional work to study. If you aren't committed, there's nothing on this earth that will fix it for you.It's completely possible that your professor is an idiot, or that you don't understand her, or that her accent is too think, or that she doesn't know how to teach. The usual underlying source of the problem is that not every student-instructor matchup is ideal or works. We all do our level best to teach as broadly as we can. However, you can take the class with the same professor, or a different professor, or you may not have a choice. Research has shown that it makes no statistical difference. There's a confirmation bias, though; students who retake the class tend to either drop it or pass. The ones who would have failed dropped instead, so the anecdotal evidence of Professor Foo being better than Professor Bar is biased. Think about it; why would it be more likely that the second professor was better?If you decide to or have to retake a class, you need to make a decision: are you going to commit to it, or are you going to fail again? You know that if you repeat what you did before, you'll almost certainly fail (students getting 59%, or whatever the cutoff is, are so exceptionally rare; most get 45% or below). You know that you have to commit more time, make more of an effort, and learn more than you did the last time. If you decide that you're going to do what it takes, and follow through on that, you'll do fine. Now, ""what it takes"" might be a lot: more studying, reading the book before and after each class, going to office hours, doing every bit of extra credit offered, spending time with tutors or TAs every week... now you have the advantage of Khan Academy, YouTube, countless websites explaining any possible subject, and if you make an effort, you'll find someone who can explain the concepts so that you understand.The student who retakes a class and fails again, though, typically do none of those things. They do have an advantage over the last time, which is that they were at least exposed to most/all of the content before, but that creates a risk; students will rationalize ""I started failing in Week 6, so I'll just skip until then"", not realizing that the roots of their failure almost certainly started earlier. It's hard to retake a course with the same prof covering the same material the same way; it's usually like rewatching a movie you didn't like, three times a week for 50 minutes.So, what can you do? If you are retaking a course you should:1. Literally plan all of your hours into a calendar online/on your phone, including reading hours, reviewing hours, hours in tutoring, study group hours, and homework hours, starting with the assumption that for every hour in class, you should spend 3 hours working (you won't be perfect, but keep to this as much as possible)2. Plan these hours over the whole week; work on it every day, even if only for 30 minutes3. Use every resource you have; if you get your homework done and are sure it's right, but still have time left, spend that time doing other problems from the book, or that you find online4. Take notes in class by hand; this has been shown to improve student performance across the board, in part because you have notes to study from, in part because thinking through the material in order to write what you can before the next point comes up will help you remember, and because you will be paying attention in class (most of the time; no one's perfect)Assuming it's a class that meets three hours per week, you'll need to study 12 hours per week. In four weeks, that's a total of 48 hours. It sounds like a lot, but c'mon, everyone's killed two days doing nothing.At 4 weeks in (or after the first exam), go talk to the prof and ask how you are doing. If you are failing again, it's time to start a dialog, but now you can talk about all of the effort you are putting in in concrete terms. It's very common for a student to say ""I studied a lot!"" and mean they studied for 2 hours the day before the exam (often because that is a lot, to them), so yeah, we tend to assume you aren't putting in the effort. Again, the actual ""intellectual failure"" is very uncommon, so don't worry about this too much.If you are doing well, you can back off on the hours, but slowly and carefully.Now, I know it seems like I'm answering a different question: how do I succeed when I retake a class? Yes, but I'm doing it as preparation for my answer.It can feel either freeing or humiliating. If you believe that you are far too intelligent to need to put in the hours of work recommended above (or anything close), and you retake the class and try to pass the same way, and fail again, you'll be humiliated, usually after spending the semester ""bored"". It might seem that all the effort would feel humiliating, but it feels freeing as you see your control of yourself and your growing mastery of the material. You'll find that your social life doesn't suffer (much), and you'll know that you can work your ass off. You'll know that in a crunch, you can and will put in the effort. And unlike believing in your innate intelligence, which is just what you happened to end up with, your ability to work hard is a reflection on character, which you can control. You're also much more likely to be engaged, rather than bored.I've been doing this for over 20 years, both as a student and now as a professor. I've successfully guided many students from F's to C's and even A's and B's. The tendency to blame the failure on the prof, the book, the system, the man... it's not borne out by the data. I'm not saying it doesn't happen; I'm just saying it's rare.sotl;dr It feels how you want it to feel; if you repeat and get the same outcome, you'll be humiliated, but if you commit, there's nothing like the feels you get passing a class that you previously failed, and it feels good during, too."	I highly doubt it, I know many students who have to retake classes and the outcome is either the new grade over-rights the old one or it stays as two separate grades. In both options you passed the retake and have a college degree. So if someone does not want to hire you based on you failing a class in the past but learned from your mistakes and showed growth then you do not want to be an employee for them either.
does google display network require any site to have it seo onpage and offpage optimized first before they can proceed with gdn is this possible	how can i get my name off the first page on google search	0	You don’t necessarrilly need an SEO optimized page to work with Google Display Network. You do need to be compliant with the network (having disclaimers, links to contact pages, etc.). That said, if you provide a good SEO experience (good loading times, good navigation and interlinking, etc.) you will increase your relevance score and do better in Adwords.	It could be hard to get your name off the first page of Google Search, even with the help of a good online reputation management company. That's because, in an online reputation management campaign the goal is to replace unwanted (normally negative) content about an entity - be it a business or a person - that shows up on page one of Google search results with positive content about that entity.So online reputation management might help you alter which results containing your name show up on the first page of Google, but in most cases they won't all together eliminate your name from (the first page of) Google.Good Services to Clean Up Your Name and Information on GoogleIf you do decide to use content removal[1] or online reputation services to take control of your name on Google and other search engines, you might want to consider hiring one of the companies below.

how hard is it to fake appearing spiritual in a christian community	why did the battle of agincourt happen how does it compare to the battle of edge hill	0	In my own experience, it was far too easy to “have a form of godliness” without actually being godly or righteous.In my case, I think I did it because I feared the censure and rancor from family members (especially my parents) and Christians if I admitted that I struggled with my faith. So it was easier to pretend everything was all right. I still remember the one time I went to my mother, nearly in tears, because I found it easier to love my kitten than to love God. She turned on me, glaring at me, and snapped, “Did your kitten die on the cross for you?! How could you even say such a thing?” When my mother blurted to my grandmother that I was considering suicide, my grandmother’s only response was to harrumph, “You’ll go to hell!” So I learned that, in spite of the biblical admonition to “confess your faults one to another,” I couldn’t expect any compassion or understanding, only platitudes and condemnation. I chose to “go along to get along.”No one really wanted to hear that I had questions, felt daunted and defeated with the challenges of “being a good Christian,” or that I was troubled about a problem I had with health or finances. They wanted me to just smile because “Jesus loves you! Why wouldn’t you smile just knowing that?” Or else they’d cue up the false sympathy. “What’s WRONG, Natasha? Did I hit a nerve?” (Or some iteration of “How is telling you what the Bible says not showing you compassion?”)This happened a lot at the Christian college I went to. Ensemble members were held up as model students, and your level of spirituality was largely measured by how many demerits you had or how “cheerful and submissive” you presented yourself. So long as my skirt was long enough, and I wore my hosiery outside the dorms, no one cared about my relationship with God. The pastor of the church even made it a point to warn students that it’s harder to have a relationship with God there because it’s so easy to pretend just to fit in. It was like a Stepford Wives community.	The battle of Agincourt happened because Henry V had a tougher time of it at Harfleur than he anticipated due to dysentery in his siege camp. It was late in the year and he needed to find someplace to overwinter. Rather than get on a boat and retreat to England he decided to take his army to English held Calais. And he took them overland rather than use his invasion fleet to hop round the coast as it had been dispersed back to EnglandThe French army that had been raised to relieve Harfleur marched to intercept him. I don’t know why the French were so tardy and didn’t make it to Harfleur in time to save the town, Henry was there for a month.Henry failed to evade the French and had to take them on with his experienced army tired and in poor health, but his skillful use of the terrain meant that he bogged the French men at arms down in the mud and surrounded them on three sides.Edgehill was completely different, and I don’t know why you are trying to compare them. Both sides had secure supply lines, both were very new armies and had plenty of untried troops and some materials were in short supply.Charles had far more freedom of choice than Henry, he could have taken his army anywhere, he was in no way forced along the road to London, he took it because he wanted the war over quickly. He knew Essex would intervene, Parliament had to keep London, and he thought he would beat them. Essex’s position also in no way resembled Henry’s, he had a well supplied army, he didn’t know where the King was (unlike the French and English armies in the Agincourt campaign who were dogging each other’s footsteps most on the way), and he was on his way to relive the besieged town of Banbury when his scouts ran into the King’s scouts. Edgehill was an accident, not a long anticipated confrontation after a couple of weeks of chasing around.The battle used cavalry as actual cavalry; at Agincourt the French had mounted troops but they just charged straight at the English defensive position and got mown down. Terrain advantage lay with the Royalists as they had a ridge to deploy on, but they made no attempt to close down the front to a narrow defile. Outflanking was done loudly and obviously by cavalry, not by concealed missile troops and conventionally Parliament countered with their own cavalry, though ineffectually.Parliament’s army wavered as their cavalry was swept away and the Royalists advanced to meet them - Henry stuck to his position. What stopped Charles winning the battle was the fact that his cavalry were too busy chasing routed Parliamentarian cavalry and looting their camp, Parliament still had a few in reserve and they helped their infantry beat back the Royalist infantry and even managed to menace the King’s sons by breaking through Royalist lines. However with most of their cavalry gone the Parliamentarians couldn’t make enough of this advantage and when some of the Royalist cavalry eventually returned to the fray they withdrew.The battle ended as a draw - while Agincourt was a fairly decisive win - both sides retreating to their camps leaving a rearguard to take pot shots at each other and neither willing to have another go the following day. Charles went on to take a few towns along the Thames Valley to secure supply lines, while Essex returned directly to London and when he met the king’s army again at Turnham Green had more than enough men to hold the Royalists back.The only resemblance between the two was that a cavalry unit got detached from the fray to loot a camp and baggage train. But at Agincourt this seems to have happened at the end of the battle when the French had already been mauled enough to withdraw and did not affect the outcome.

do people with anemia die younger	does anemia increase irritability	0	They have an increased risk of dying sooner than normal.There are many, many forms of anaemia but by definition anaemia is a condition in which there is a deficiency of red cells or of haemoglobin in the blood, resulting in pallor and weariness.Haemoglobin is an Oxygen Carrier.  Also known a red blood cells. A drop of blood contains millions of red blood cells. These specialised cells are like flattened discs, which gives them a much greater surface area with which to exchange oxygen and carbon dioxide in the lungs and with body cells.Without the proper exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide, there can be discomfort, a drop in quality of life, and possibly many life-threatening complications later down the line.In the example of B12 deficiency, my body was anaemic because I no longer had the essential nutrient for my bone marrow to make new red blood cells. My red blood cells started to become deformed to compensate for the loss in numbers. I became weak, nauseous, out of breath and confused. I also started having heavy bleeding, night sweats and an ill-looking complexion.Had I not been treated for my anaemia, I could have had permanent nerve damage and possibly brain damage. Pernicious Anaemia is called this because it used to be fatal.Many other forms of anaemia are a lot more manageable and less severe - or could take decades before they become a problem.	Anemia could be the result of many medical or psychical conditions. I would mainly associate it with the inability to absorb what life offers us or a result of stress which leads to rejecting the natural flow of things.Irritability? Not necessary. Irritability as a result of the weakness and  somebody or something pressing too much, may be, but not a direct result or straight connection between those two.
how do you feel about the new macbook pro late 2016	should i get the new macbook pro	1	Thanks for A2AI own a macbook pro (late 2009) at home for personal use and iMac 27″ 2016 latest model in office (so i know how it feels when you work on new and old models :-)I am thinking now what i will gonna do if i am at your place here are few pointsMy very first opinion is to wait.I should wait for few months if newer model is coming since buying a new macbook is big investment (atleast to me :-) )as i will use it for next couple of years (newer model will help you to do faster and better in coming years. As we understand that, day by day newer apps and software versions requires more memory and faster processor.Inshort waiting for newer model worth the wait and will be beneficial for your upcoming task for next few years - although the current macbook will do the tasks as well but newer is better.There are other reasons as well. Since past few years apple is constructing macbooks with non upgradeable memory feature (memories are soldered on board)Buying a newer model will give you the opportunity to get more RAM at faster bus speed (again benifical for your future use)The only reason to buy the current macbook is if you need it urgently in few days or by next month.The price will not be much higher when they launched new model and on the other hand the price will drop instantly on current model.

does covering your head while sleeping cause brain damage	does binge drinking cause long term brain damage	0	YES, Brain is a delicate structure, can be damaged by very trivial change in physiology of CSF. But of course, just sleeping head covered does not damage brain.Sleeping head covered by clothing, blanket etc , make your own exhaled air enhaled which contains more carbon dioxide.Carbon dioxide in small amounts acts as respiratory stimulant.While sleeping your oxygen demand is decreased due to reduced metabolism.Hence oxygen demand is reduced.But it's better to sleep without perfumes, deodorant etc.Keep sleeping comfortably,body will adopt a safer and comfortable position.Enjoy sleeping.	Hell, Yes.Assuming the binge drinker lives a long time, because binge drinking can cause immediate brain and body damage.Read about it here: Binge drinking - Wikipedia“Binge drinking causes brain damage faster and more severely than chronic drinking (alcoholism). The neurotoxic insults are due to very large amounts of glutamate which are released and over-stimulate the brain as a binge finishes. This results in excitotoxicity, a process which damages or kills neurons (brain cells).[8] Each binge drinking episode immediately insults the brain; repeat episodes result in accumulating harm. The developing adolescent brain is thought to be particularly susceptible to the neurotoxic effects of binge drinking, with some evidence of brain damage occurring from drinking more than 10 or 11 drinks once or twice per month.[9]”Of course, immediate, total destruction of the brain by binge drinking is common. Typically, this results from motor vehicle accidents or wandering where one shouldn't, but the Darwin Awards list many of the more creative ways drunkards have offed themselves.Further info can be found here: CDC - Fact Sheets-Binge Drinking - AlcoholOr look it up yourself, google: “health effects of binge drinking.”
what are the major differences between chinese culture and western cultures	what is the difference between chinese and western culture	1	As an anecdote, I was conversing with a Chinese-American Evangelist who stated that Christianity was persecuted and repressed within mainland China. However, I didn’t agree because Christians were not singled out for harsher treatment from society and politics. When we both attempted to explain our positions, he argued that the CCP was a dictatorship which should be overthrown to deliver social and religious freedom. Although I agreed that the Communist Party was often heavy-handed, I was appalled by his willingness to dismantle the existing order (rather than attempting to work within the system) for reform, which could throw China “into another bloody civil war” or enable foreign powers “to reimpose unequal treaties”.In retrospect, I believe that roots of our disagreement stem from Confucianism and Christianity, which believes that original sin is inherited as an act of turning away from God, who empowers an individual’s free will by granting them the choice to establish a personal, heartfelt relationship with Him. This contrasts with a Confucian assertion that people are born inherently good, but chose to become evil after performing behavior that harmed them and society. I thus attempted to revolve my personal habits and lifestyle around a collectivist viewpoint that idealized “stability and harmony” on earth, but not heaven.As a result, a Confucian does not consider him/herself to take priority over other people and the nation-state. Their social roles remain more or less unspoken, so individuals and the CCP expected each other to follow tacitly agreed-upon limits until very recently. If citizens did not oppose the government, they were ignored and allowed to gain wealth. The political reformers were also satisfied, because it was possible for potential (albeit gradual) reform in the government. The modern centralized administration arose from warlord-ruled provinces that reunified in a life-and-death struggle against a shared enemy during the Second Sino-Japanese War (1937–1945), despite their cultural, ethnic, and geographic divisions. Despite this, Confucianism is ultimately responsible for creating and actively enforcing a “tyranny of the majority” because an individual’s rights are carefully controlled by the government and society. Although rulers attempt to gain their legitimacy by catering to public opinion, this can easily silence dissent: “the nail that sticks up is hammered down”. (出る釘は打たれる)Similar themes can be found in Squirrel and Hedgehog, when the spy from Flower Hill sent a warning with his own blood.Unlike Christianity’s assertion of an Absolute Truth and divine intervention in human affairs, Confucius told his followers to “respect ghosts and spirits, but keep them at a distance.” Instead of turning to God, I looked toward the past to discern cultural and historical patterns which could explain this authoritarian leadership: In short, the overthrow of a dynasty was a power grab (not a quest for liberty) under a new emperor, whose own descendants were toppled after they became unresponsive to the welfare of the population or lost control of China’s internal and external affairs. This cycle continued for 4000 years, opening the door for bloodshed, famine, national division, and foreign invasion without any long-lasting changes. The U.S. Constitution, however, was based upon the idea of God-given rights (“We hold these truths to be self-evident and that all men are created equal”), creating a highly flawed, but self-correcting democracy with active civic participation among well-educated and propertied white males in 1791.

what words rank the highest on dictionarycom  difficulty index	can hindi words get a place in the oxford dictionary	0	Hi asker,I have been browsing through the internet and found this:the definition of usqueWhen you search the word “usque”, you get a latin phrase that nobody seems to know. The difficulty rating is higher than any other words mentioned here.It is not 100% English, but it is from dictionary.com, so I thought I might as well as share it if I have the knowledge.Hope I answered your question!	There are many words in the English language that are borrowed from Hindi like Avatar, Chit (chitti), Guru, Jungle and Loot. You can find many more examples like this. All these words have been included in the Oxford dictionary. Slowly as the world becomes more globalized, more and more Hindi words would find their way into the English dictionary.
why can not i feel remorse or empathy at all	why do i not feel remorse	0	Love seems like a mystery. I killed animals as a kid and never felt bad about it. I don’t feel emotions about lying, cheating, or stealing. I’m not sure what guilt or joy really is. Why do I hardly feel any emotions?	Remorse generally involves an implication of guilt on the part of the experiencer.A death in the family could cause a wide range of emotions depending on many factors but remorse would most often be associated if you personally caused the death in some way. Have you contributed to the death of a family member and feel nothing, or do you feel nothing when a family member passes away?The same goes for your girlfriend: do you hurt her feelings and feel nothing when she cries, or does she cry over other matters and you feel nothing?If it is the latter of the two, many factors, such as your preferred method of cognitive processing, could come into play. If you are a primary Thinker emotions are not going to come as naturally to you as they will for those who view the world through a Feeling lens. This is something that develops with time and some people who strongly prefer Thinking never wade too deep into “the feels.” Most societies also teach, inadvertently or not, that men “aren't supposed to cry.”Childhood dynamics could significantly factor in as well. Did you experience trauma of some kind in your formative years, say, age 2–12, or even multiple traumas? If so, too much exposure to highly emotional situations as a kid will send your body into “self protection mode” as an adult, meaning you subconsciously bury those painful Feels. Therapy can help for this, but even simply being cognizant of it can as well, or having someone you trust to talk to, or journaling or some other form of creative expression. The biggest one, time, will also help to eventually shake out those emotions and that will usually happen whether you want it to or not. I call it the “thawing out process.”If it is the former of the two and you are unable to experience remorse when you cause pain or damage to others then a Cluster B personality disorder is one possibility: think Dexter. Other possibilities are vast as well, though, brain damage being one, overall physical and emotional health, or lack thereof, being another.I'm a huge advocate of therapy for, well, everyone. If you're not opposed to trying out a therapist, I would seek out one with specific experience in emotional regulation/disregulation and/or any of the other topics that I or other writers have brought up. Remember, you can schedule an appointment to “interview” potential therapists and most will do this free of charge. Often if they don't it's a good sign to skip them anyway and getting the right “vibe” with and from your therapist is a huge key to the success of the treatment regardless of how long you go. I saw probably 10 very different therapists over about a decade of my life, most for only a session or two, until I accidentally stumbled upon The One. And that, has made all the difference.
how many minutes of cardio a day should i do	how many minutes of yoga can be done in a day	0	Let me first say this: You're not limited to cardio. Even people who can't walk can still lift weights or at least their own bodyweight.Now that's out of the way, let's say this cardio is cycling or running. If cardio is the only thing you can do then 10-15 minute sprints (sprints so you're mostly at top speed) or 1 hour of cycling every day should do the trick.What you're after with this type of exercise will only be focused on overall health and maybe some form of muscle growth specially with your legs and core (yes, sprinting can develop the core)If you want, I recommend kettlebell training as its both cardio and weight lifting in one go.http://www.fitandwrite.com/lot-e...	Practice regularly, even if it's only a few minutes every day. If done every day or nearly every day, even 10 to 15 minutes will help build concentration, increase flexibility and strengthen willpower, making it easier to practice the next day. Consistency is key. If possible, establish a regular time of day to set aside for practice. Morning or evening practice is advised.Practice when your body is most limber. Some people find their bodies are stiff in the morning, making practice more difficult. Night practice, however may limit the kinds of postures you do as some are too stimulating and affect sleep. The key is regularity. Enjoy whatever time you have set aside for practice.Most yoga instructors believe that there is more benefit to doing a brief practice regularly than hit-or-miss home practice sessions, sporadic class attendance, or the occasional workshop. The greatest and longest-lasting benefits are achieved when at least 3 or 4 yoga asanas are done every day.Most experts recommend a minimum of 10 minutes of practice every day. However, to practice a range of postures and incorporate breathing or meditation, 15 to 25 minutes is necessary. These brief practice sessions should also be interspersed with longer sessions several times a week.
why is my dog biting me	why did my dog bite me	0	Many things can cause this. Roughhousing can cause play biting, this is not out of aggression and is simply intended to be in good fun even if the dog is being rough. If that's not it, and if you are calmly disciplining your dog, gently but firmly it can be a good sign your dog is in pain. Make sure you are not doing anything to make the dog feel threatened either. Even big dogs can get scared easily by yelling or putting your hands on the dog aggressively. If your dog isn't being frightened, take him/her to a vet. Dogs can become very aggressive when sick or in pain so it could very well be a health problem. Maybe he/she has other issues. Shelter dogs can come from anywhere, your dog could have been abused or simply taught to be aggressive by a previous owner, if that's the case training is needed before things escalate. Also learn your dogs body language so you can know when he/she doesn't want to be messed with. It is most likely a very fixable problem. Overall make sure the dog feels safe, comfortable and isn't ill.	"This is an easy question to respond to with a joke. And I have enjoyed the humor in some of the other answers. But I’ll attempt a serious one. As a guess (since I don’t know how you and your dog get along normally), I would say he was stressed out by the loud and aggressive energy between you and your friend, and urgently wanted to leave. It sounds like he had no intention of hurting you, but was using his mouth to “carry” you away. Your music may hurt his ears. Dog ears are MUCH more sensitive than ours. And it may sound angry and confrontational to him. And your reactions to winning may have looked like it could develop into a violent altercation. So he may be very distressed by the discomfort and the possible risk to his human in the situation. He sounds like a really smart dog, to bring you out to the car like that. And if I am right about his reasons, he is very devoted to you. Take good care of him.I answered - “Why did my dog bite me? Me and my friend were having a rap battle. I killed him with this diss: ""he drops the bar of soap, there's no hope, the black prisoner makes him choke"". Everybody was cheering for me but my dog, kuro, wasn't happy. He bit my wrist not too painfully taking me with him outside to my car.”"
how can i treat a severe foot sprain	how can i get a severe foot sprain	0	There are many different ways of treating severe arthritis. The way used to treat arthritis may depend on the symptoms and type of arthritis affecting the person.i) Medication - Most people who experience severe arthritis will normally see a medical doctor to get medication to ease and reduce their arthritis pain. Doctors will normally prescribe NSAIDs( Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs) to reduce inflammation and swelling. These NSAIDs may be beneficial in treating the symptoms and providing short term relief to those suffering from severe arthritis. Some commonly used NSAIDs include aspirin, ibuprofen and naproxen. You also need to be aware that these NSAIDs may cause side effects like stroke, heart attack, stomach ulcers and kidney damage. In view of this, these drugs can be used for short term pain relief.ii) Physiotherapy - Together with medication, physiotherapy plays an important role in managing arthritis pain. It can help you maintain independence through improved strength, mobility and flexibility. Physiotherapists will examine your muscles, posture and the way you walk and this includes activities that causes you pain. They will design a personalised treatment plan which may include hydrotherapy, massage and pain relief techniques.iii) Surgery - For those people having advance arthritis, medication will no longer be an option. They will have to go for surgery to have arthritis pain relief. The operations may includea) replacing a badly damaged jointb) releasing trapped nervesc) removing the inflamed lining of the joint cavityd) removing bone to relieve paine) repairing damaged tendonsIn most cases surgeries have been successful in restoring the knee-joints and reducing the pain substantially. The disadvantage of surgery is that it is costly and there are cases where surgery fail to restore the knee joint.iv) Exercise - For osteoarthritis, exercise may be the preferred option. Exercise can help relieve stiffness, reduce pain and swelling and also improve muscle and bone strength. The exercise programs may includea) low-impact aerobic activityb) range of motion exercise for flexibilityc) strength training for muscle tonev) Weight management - Losing weight is another way that can greatly reduce knee-joint pain. When a person has excess weight, this extra weight will normally add additional pressure on the knee-joint which aggravates the arthritis pain. Young adults who are categorised as obese should try to lose weight as this will delay the onset of getting arthritis and joint pain. Another thing about maintaining the right weight is that you will have less health problems as you grow older.vi) Lifestyle changes - People who are afflicted by arthritis should participate in stress reducing activities like meditation, yoga or tai-chi.We can improve the strength and flexibility of the joints by practicing certain yoga postures. These postures include Warrior pose, Tree pose, Triangle pose, Bridge posture and Corpse pose. If you regularly practice yoga using the right postures coupled with meditation, you can get pain relief from arthritis.vii) Healthy and balanced diet - Eat a healthy diet full of fruits and vegetables, which contain important vitamins and minerals, especially vitamin E. Eat foods rich in omega-3 fatty acids, such as cold water fish(salmon, mackerel, and herring), flaxseed, rapeseed (canola) oil.You can treat the arthritis pain that you are suffering with one of the above mentioned ways. You should carefully consider your circumstances and situation that you are in before deciding which approach will bring the desired outcome.And finally a solution that I think will help you: Completely Heal Any Type Of Arthritis In 21 Days Or Less Following This Step-By-Step Strategy – 100% Guaranteed!

how can a severe crick in the neck be treated	what are some symptoms of a severe crick in the neck	0	If this is a one-time event I would apply a heating pad to relax the muscles. However, if this is frequent or persistent then I would consult a rheumatoligist to determine if I were developing arthritis. The most important thing to do whenever there is persistent pain is to obtain a diagnosis to ensure proper treatment is being provided. Early diagnosis is key to minimizing irreparable damage.

who do i activate the dlc of skyrim in a laptop ive got it working on my computer after doing the command lines but did the same on laptop to no use	i am tired of the laptops ive bought getting old and slow after 2ish years do desktops degrade as quickly will getting a solid state drive laptopdesktop help increase its longevity	0	This is what I personally would do/have done. I would recommend not trying this unless if you’re comfortable with your computer. Also, this is more of a “better to be safe than sorry later” approach to destroying viruses.You’re going to want to boot the computer into Safe Mode. That can easily be done on all computers by searching the computer for “msconfig” and clicking on it. In the window that pops up, select the “Boot” tab and select “Safe boot” and make sure to tick the “Network” box just so you can access the internet while you’re in safe mode and restart the computer. If you’re unable to access it this way, restart the computer and press “F8” until a screen appears and select “Safe Mode with Networking” from the list.The purpose for booting the computer into Safe Mode is so that there won’t be anything but Windows basic services loading (Example: Mouse, Keyboard, Graphics Card). This minimizes the chance that programs that are part of the virus will be running.Next, go through your virus scan with Malwarebyte’s Anti-Malware. Once the scan is finished, delete the files it finds. Next, go into your browser and look at any add-ons or extensions that are installed. You can run a google search of each add-on or extension to verify that it’s legit. Any that aren’t, delete. The next step from here would be to go into “Add or Remove Programs” in the Control Panel and look at everything that’s installed on your computer. Most viruses will actually be a little arrogant and register it’s program into there. Anything that isn’t Windows related would be something to research in order to track down what virus infected you and how to deal with it. Not to mention, you’ll find where the file folders for these are and can delete them.If you accessed Safe Mode from pressing “F8” on your keyboard at the start of your computer, you can skip this last step. If not, you’ll want to go back into the “Boot” tab of “msconfig” and untick “Safe boot”. This will stop your computer from booting into safe mode every single time you restart your computer.Congratulations, you most likely have removed the virus and most certainly will want to download an antivirus that is constantly scanning any activity on your computer such as Malwarebyte’s Anti-Malware Premium, Avast, AVG, Zone Alarm or Kaspersky. The most important thing to remember is that the web is a dangerous place to be without some form of constant protection.	"Well, ""degrade"" is an interesting way to put it. Though hardware components do degrade over time, this process is slow and likely your hardware has shipped more capable than what it is set to perform. So a degradation will not affect the expected performance of the hardware, within 2 years there will be no difference.The other interesting point is ""longevity"". The causes of a laptop to be considered dated can be real slow downs, such as multiple background/startup programs hogging up resources, or in comparison, being so much slower than new machines. Since technology constantly improves, an older laptop will always under perform a newer one. So perhaps the goal is to purchase a machine that will stay within a small margin of the performance of newer products.Computer products have a tiered shift phenomenon, in which last generation's top model becomes this generation's mid-range, last mid-range becomes bottom tier, and the top model gets a new rendition. The only way to have your last generation PC to be as good as this generations mid-range is to purchase a top model. Top tier PCs often have expensive features tacked on that most people have no need for, such as a high performance graphics card, that drives up the price. It seems what the asker is seeking is how can I meet next generations mid-tier performance without buying a top-tier PC this generation.You have some good suggestions. Dollar for dollar a desktop PC will always outperform a similarly priced laptop, since desktop components focus on performance rather than size or power efficiency. It could be said that this generation's mid-tier desktop will perform at the level of next generation's mid-tier laptop. Adding an SSD is one of the most significant improvements that can be made to the current state of PC hardware. It is magnitudes faster than an HDD and the effects are noticeable in almost every application. Additionally, it is probably the only observable improvement to the current state of PC's that the average user would notice. Processors are already more than fast enough for general tasks, high tier graphics cards dont matter unless your gaming, more RAM does nothing (8GB is already generous). That really just leaves the data device.The short answer is you were right all along, get a desktop with an SSD and you will be miles ahead."
how do i register institute providing training in various programming languages for vocational courses as it will exempt it from the service tax	how much marks should i score in ssc cpo to get delhi police	0	No, there is no need for the same. You are a sole-proprietor and no registration as such is required for the same. As you scale your business, you can convert your sole-proprietor into company as sole-proprietor attracts unlimited liability & company have limited liablity. No capital Gains tax would arise on such conversion.Coming to the tax part,Income tax : Looking at your earnings of Rs.2000 per month, its too low which is well covered within the income tax slab limit which at present(as of 2015) is Rs. 250,000 after deductions.So, you don't have to pay income tax.Service tax : Chrageability of service tax depends upon your type of service. Even, if your service is liable to service tax, you would have to pay service tax only when you cross turnover of Rs.10lakhs.Other taxes: There is one tax which you would have to register & also pay which is professional tax. Amount of tax depends upon each state.I hope that helps. In case of any other query relates to business aspect side, mail me on skmanishjain@hotmail.com	Its depends on total vacancies in delhi police and the difficulty level of exam .But in most years i predict that vacancies are less in delhi police so cutoff is too high.In 2014–15 it is above 325 for general category and in 2016 it is 287 and this time in 2017 exam level is easy to moderate so its easy for candidates to score good marks So this year too cutoff will be 310+.If you want to join dp si u have to score approx 300–320. Then there will a chance u get dp si.
how imminent is world war 3	are we heading toward world war 3	1	Here is the state of the world now (only highlights).North Korea- Has missiles and Nukes in its stockpile. Their missiles do not have enough range to reach continental US. Even if they somehow manage to strike a few Nukes at the US, it will only affect the impact zones immediately. So it will result in the total wipe out of NK in the US’s retaliation. North does not want to nuke the south coz their first goal is to take over the south and unite the Koreas. It does not want to attack any of its neighbors simply because there are no compelling reasons to do so for North. So there’s no real threat.Russia- She has a lot of technologically advanced weapons. Some even better than the US. She has a stock pile of Nukes and intercontinental ballistic missiles. But they have one thing working against them. Their own economy. Their economy is weak. They cannot keep the supplies alive to support an all out war or an invasion. No place can be dominated or occupied without boots on the ground. So there’s no real threat.China- She has the largest army. Lot of hardware, strong economy, many missiles and long history as well. What is working against them is their size and their political leadership. Most of the weapons in their arsenal are old and reverse engineered stuff from the Soviet era. They are modernizing however, but not at the rates they want. Also their navy and air force does not have enough hardware to back an invasion. So no real threat.India- Certainly a large number of people, large army. Relatively modern Air force and Navy. India is historically peaceful and non-aggressive they have stood their ground against aggressors but never pushed back. Also the air force does not have the infrastructure to support an invasion. Navy has inadequate number of modern vessels. Submarine fleet is aging. Modernization is happening at a snail’s pace. Political leadership is not helping with the process either. So no real threat.Europe- Collectively, very powerful and has strategic advantage over the rest of the world due to sheer strength and size of hardware of individual members and the collective strategic knowledge and experience. However, Europe is not as united as they wish to be. Member nations have trust issues with each other due to leftover emotions from previous two world wars. Also there is an impending financial crisis and a social crisis due to the refugee movement. So no real threat.Africa-Individual nations(some of them) may be strong enough to defend own territories against invaders, however none of the African nations are strong enough to launch a war or an invasion against even their Asian neighbors; let alone European or American. Also, most of the continent is torn apart by countless civil wars, racial and tribal conflicts and regional disputes. There is not enough reasons for an outward spill-over of the conflicts. So no real threat.South America- Same as Africa. Third world countries, slow or crippled economies, poverty, smaller, largely inadequate military forces. There are no compelling reasons for them to cause a large scale conflict, let alone global. So no real threat.Middle East- There are a few who can put up a real tough fight against an invading foreign military.Their situational awareness, familiarity with terrain and guerrilla tactics are all advantageous but only works withing the region so they are only good at defense. Certain countries possess good hardware and moderately large modern armed forces. However, none of the Middle Eastern countries possess the military strength to lead an invasion on foreign land or sustain the defense of their own territories for a long time (including Iran). Also they are not synonymous with the modern equipment that they possess. This is because of lack of experience in large scale multi-face, multi-theater warfare and lack of trust between troops. This seriously undermines the collective efforts. So no real threat.Last but not least,USA- Uncle Sam checks off all items on the list when it comes to size, numbers and weaponry. Certainly strong, economy wise. Has a global reach and has lead countless invasions, successfully. They are already the dominating force and has a firm hand of control over the world with many military bases in strategic locations across the entire planet. She is ruling the world now, at least by a big margin (Economically, politically and strategically). So she wouldn’t do anything that would start a third world war and cause a global meltdown. Because once the world goes in to the chaos of war, the balance of power might tip against them. Off course she will get involved in many other small scale conflicts, trying to bring down a dictatorship or install a new one, home-delivering freedom and democracy to the needful. Still, no real threat.Unless something dramatic plays out anytime soon or some nut job decides to let some nukes loose willy-nilly, we are certainly not heading towards a third world war. So just relax and have a cold beer.	Here is the state of the world now (only highlights).North Korea- Has missiles and Nukes in its stockpile.

what could be narendra modi  next move after demonetization	what is next step after demonetization	1	What do you think of the decision by the Indian Government to demonetize 500 and 1000 rupee notes? Do you think it will it help in curbing black money and corruption?	Here are some possibilities:Moving all government offices and universities out of cash. Your fees and dues could be accepted only through netbanking or mobile wallets or bank cheques.Fully move all government purchases cashless and through common procurement systems.Rapid rollout of cashless infrastructure to rural India. Besides POS terminals, the emphasis could be on more incentives for smartphone penetration and internet connectivity. There might even be special schemes for women - as their smartphone usage is low. Target 100% smartphone penetration by the end of the first term.Making it illegal to do cash payments for any purchases above Rs. 20000. Everything from cars and homes and home appliances and jewelry to be bought through cashless payments. Like in the developed world, anyone having wads of cash will be looked at suspiciously.Enacting benami transactions bill to impede purchasing property with other people’s names.Greater transparency in real estate transactions through a new act.Finally, the Direct Benefit Transfer for all government subsidies. Instead of the government giving you cheap kerosene, power, urea etc, the intended beneficiaries will get money directly sent to their account. That will let government machinery focused on real problems.Focusing on distributing Debit Cards to everyone and once sufficient number is achieved, discontinuing Rs. 2000 Note.
if you have me you want to share me if you share me you have not  got me what am i	if you have me you want to share me if you share me you do not  get me what am i	1	I got gang raped.Gang. Raped.I'm going to give some details… so I guess trigger warningI went to a fish market with my uncle and grandma. My grandma is old and can't walk very well so I was waiting with her for my uncle to get some fish. This huge man comes and picks me up from behind. I'm pretty strong, but this man was much stronger. He grabbed me and ran as I screamed for my uncle to help me. He came too late.So. The big man “A”The other men are “B” “C” and “D”A grabbed me and brought me to a cornerB C D take turns throwing me against a fence as they all undress. They all are on me at the same time. One would be one my face making me suck his dick. One would be masturbating on my chest. One would be doing whatever he wanted on my vagina. One would be holding down my legs.They tied down my arms above my head, stripped me naked, did their rotations, and broke my ankle.I kept squirming so they punched me, gagged me, and stabbed right below my ribcage with a knife. I stopped moving and they rotated a few times. When they were done, about and hour later, they tied to me to fence.They would grab me from behind, touch all over me, cum on me, and then forced me to masturbate. They stuck their fingers up my vagina, put their dicks in my mouth. They made me masturbate on the floor, and then would smack me with their dicks wherever they felt like it.It was torturous. I was in so much pain. They ran Away. The police were searching everywhere, and then one found me on the floor behind a trashcan in an alley. They took me to a hospital, and it gave me so much emotional trauma.Right now, a year later, I am crying in my room, too scared to go anywhere, ripping at my thighs and stomach with a blade. Burning with lighters. I never told anyone else. The only people that know is my grandma, uncle, mom, and dad. I'm too scared to tell anyone.

what is the problem with controlled fusion	why have not  we developed a fusion reactor capable of generating more energy than it consumes what are the problems we face	0	The fundamental problem with controlled fusion can be summed up in one phrase: Plasma is hard.Really, fusion is easy. You can make a device that does a lot of fusion cheaply in your garage (Fusor). Table top fusion is something we solved long ago.The problem is scalability and self-sustainability. To get enough energy density to make it economical, you need to deal with high density plasmas, which is hard. Not just because they're nasty things, but because they're incredibly hard to make and study. The only natural source is in the center of The Sun, and it's very expensive to make in the lab. A good chunk of the money that goes into fusion research is actually going into making and studying these dense, hot plasmas.What most people don't seem to understand is that fusion research is mostly fundamental/pure science, because we simply don't know enough about these things to get to the engineering problems that we'll have to solve to do them practically.To put this in perspective, when 10 billion is spent on the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), and it does something unexpected, it's a success. When 10 billion is spent on the National Ignition Facility, and it does something unexpected, it's a failure. This is the fundamental misconception of fusion research, people think that it is failed engineering instead of successful pure science.	Why do we bother with fusion power when we have a stable fusion generator 93 million miles away which supplies us with all the energy we need? All we have to do is collect it, and we are perfectly capable of doing so these days.

is it necessary to unlock bootloader before rooting android phones	how clockworkmod works for phones not having bootloader unlocked	0	"It is not necessary to unlock the boot loader before rooting android devices.Android boot loader helps to load either Andorid ROM or RecoveryIf the boot loader is ""LOCKED"" then it will verify what it boots. So we can't boot custom recovery like ClockworkMod, TWRP etc, also can't boot custom ROM like CyanogenMod.Unlocking boot loader turns off the verification. Unlocked boot loader will boot all the custom recovery and ROMS.So in case of rooting, sometimes it may be required to install custom recovery, in that situation boot loader have to be unlocked.Image src and more details: Bootloader - XDA-Developers"	Before you try to install any custom ROM on your device, you need to unlock the phone’s bootloader, which is a code executed before any OS (operating system) launch. The notion of a bootloader is unanimous to all operating systems worldwide and includes systems running on your personal computers, laptops, tablets, smartphones, smart watches and basically everything that has OS on itHTC website has a section for developers where you can grab SDK; you just need to find your phone’s model. Samsung website does not offer such luxury, Sony Mobile website offers a section for users looking to unlock their Sony’s bootloader.So, For Samsung Devices How to unlock Bootloader?To unlock the boot loader you need to have the ADT with all the packages installed and configured.Later once the configuration is done properly then you can connect your device and enable USB Debugging under the options.Download Modaco’s Superboot files and save them to your computer.Once downloaded, extract it by right clicking and extract all.On your phone, click on Settings > Developer Options > Turn USB Debugging On.Plug the device in to your computer via USB cable.Open the superboot folder that we just extracted (until you see the folder with fastboot-windows inside it), then hold the shift key down on your computer and right click any blank area.Now, select open command window here.In the command prompt, type the following with hitting enter at the end of each line.adb-windows reboot bootloader (and wait for the device to reboot) fastboot-windows oem unlock *If it gets stuck at waiting for device here, download and install PDANet on your computer, once installed, unplug then plug the device back in and see if that fixes it.Once it runs the device should display a screen asking you if you are sure.

what is bss engineer	is it right option from being android developer to become translator after 3 years in software development field	0	How does Google recruiting work behind the scenes, is it true that Googlers assign scores to each employment candidate, and if so, how are the...	I recently wrote about this on my blog, which you can find here: How Can A Software Developer Become A Business Analyst? - Joe BarriosHere are the highlights.1) Learn to think like a Business Analyst. The mindset of a developer is completely different from what you need as a BA. Software developers are responsible for building code, they’re not required to understand the business reasons for the code. By the time it’s the developer’s turn to code, all business questions/scenarios/concerns should have been addressed and resolved.A BA has to do all of the work to figure out what to put into those specs to begin with. The developer’s role is very much “in the weeds.” The BA is required to think more holistically about the entire business and about how to best meet business needs. It is their responsibility to get a project into a state where the software developer can simply be concerned with building the code.In order to make the transition you have to start asking some of the questions that BA’s ask. Why is the software code required in the first place? What business problem will it solve? Who will the code help? Where will the code be used by the business? How can the software be leveraged for future business capabilities? And so on.2) Learn the BABOK. The Business Analysis Body of Knowledge is the BA’s “bible.” You should become familiar with it, as it covers all of the basic BA concepts and techniques.3) Learn Business Process Modeling. Documenting and re-engineering business processes are a core BA competency. Developers may have similar experience with documenting workflows, data flows, sequence diagrams, etc., so this may not be a big lift.4) Get involved with the business. Start sitting in on meetings that define business strategy and analyze business needs. Get to know your company’s BA’s and ask to participate in their requirements sessions. It’s important to learn the perspective of a business and what it seeks to accomplish. In doing so you may also find people willing to mentor you to help your transition to business analysis.5) Understand the role of software in the larger system and business. A developer may be most concerned with the software that “he owns.” It’s important to understand how pieces of software are part of a larger integrated whole: the interfaces to other applications and systems, the interaction of human users with those systems, and the business capabilities enabled by applications and systems of systems.6) Leverage your technical knowledge as an asset. Having a software development background is a huge asset to a Business Analyst. It allows you to serve as an ideal bridge between IT and the business, since you are able to speak the technical language of IT. Being a developer also provides you insight into what is possible with coding, and how applications and systems may be changed to provide future business capabilities.
what can you do in lucid dreams	how was your experience of lucid dreaming	1	It feels like being immersed in a virtual reality with incredibly vivid graphics which allows you to fulfill your wildest fantasies.There are a few key things I noticed though:Every lucid dream is different in terms of quality (how vidid, sharp and beliveable objects are), stability (not waking up) and control (the degree to which you can influence your dream landscape)For some reason, gravity is all skewed up. I would compare it to lunar surface gravity.You can’t perform sophisticated intellectual tasks without waking up. Shame we can’t do that though, I guess that part of our brain is shut off.Sex feels amazingly real.Sometimes (not always) you can summon people, objects, places at your command which is REALLY awesome.Characters in your dreams are highly sophisticated, almost as if they were not a part of your mind, but entities of their own. You can’t really predict them.Flying is something every novice lucid dreamer starts off with. It really is very cool.Telling your dream characters they’re only part of your imagination and looking at their reactions is hilarious!You can “talk” to your subconscious mind. In other words, you can ask it a question with an intention of getting an answer and often times you will get it. It’s like sitting at a desk for a giant computer. It’s brilliant.Things I’ve done in lucid dreams - composed music, flew and flew and flew (and flew some more), had mindblowing sex with the girls of my dreams (get it?), talked with some of my idols (some of them long passed away), generally admired the highly sophisticated level of detail that my mind constructed the environment with.	I started lucid dreaming when I was a kid. I haven't even been aware that normally people can't control their dream til I was 12 (15 now).I know that I lucid dream... A LOT. I've heard that a lot of people wanted to try out once and I even helped one of my friend doing it be telling him to keep clinching his cheek, no matter it is in reality or in his dream.But I can tell you, lucid dreaming is not all that good. And somehow, I hate lucid dreaming and I will wake myself up whenever I find myself in that situation by fake sneezing (I found that this method is the BEST to wake myself up). Strange but I always end up with sleep paralysis, which is that I see horrifying things like ghosts in my room and having my body paralyzed and squeezed on my bed, when I try to shout for help, I just end up making no sound like I'm a mute. And it follows a panic attack. WORST EXPERIENCE EVER.Moreover, although I have had some cool lucid dreams... flying around, having magic and... well mostly about sex after I entered puberty, I guess, due to the sexual impulse (sorry I can't help Xd). I sometimes also get some horrifying dreams. Usually is when I found out that I'm dreaming, I say to myself: No, I'm now dreaming so I can't think of horrifying things such as ghosts or demons as they will instantly appear. And poof, here goes the worst dream, as you will hear, see, and feel. Usually dreams goes bad when I think of something like that and usually too scary that I must wake myself, then followed by the crazy feeling due to sleep paralysis.Therefore, I enjoy some of the dreams, but due to that I have had it too many times that my mind is developed to make the dreams not so enjoyable and comfortable and crazily turns it from a Harry Potter fantasy to a crazy chainsaw killer kidnap.So seriously, if you want to lucid dream, you could by pinching yourself, like every hour or so and make this event memorable and make yourself do it even when dreaming, this makes you realize that you are dreaming and thus starts a lucid dream. But, just please don't overdo it as it could get all wrong and undesirable.Oh and funny thing, when I start to sense that I might be dreaming, I'll clinch my cheek, a few dozen times just to be sure that I'm really dreaming (don't want to die when testing out my flying and ending up dead in reality). I did it too much that one time I asked myself: will my cheek just get torn apart? And you guessed it right. I got a glob of flesh pulled down but still attached to my face and is swinging like a pendulum... after that... I clinched my leg for testing. Hopefully it will go on smoothly =[
what does it feel like to be beautiful	what does it feel like to be attractive and desired by many	0	I will answer this as someone who is currently considered very attractive (I’m a dancer and former model) but I haven’t always been attractive. In fact, I was morbidly obese most my life (I went from 240 to 110lbs in two years with a strict diet and exercise plan) THIS is the old me, 20 years old and 240lbs:And this is me todayHere is what I’ve noticed after losing the weight:1)Women were nicer to me. Not men. Men would hold the doors open and do other polite things, but when it came down to dating or meeting random guys at bars, they seemed to have attitudes with me, as if they half expected me to be a stuck up bitch to them or something. Women from my work however started inviting me out more frequently, wanting to get to know me more, etc. Guys actually hit on me less at bars- maybe because they thought I would turn them down. Either way, I remember having a lot more one night stands as a fatty.2) I got promoted. Then I got another job where I got hired for a position I wasn’t even qualified for. I got the hours I wanted and the days off I wanted too. Life became easier. Previously, I’d work Christmas, thanksgiving, overtime, my days off and I’d never get the raises I asked for.3) When guys invited me out at times I would be told to bring friends for their friends. So I would bring my friends. They would be disappointed. Most of my friends did not look like supermodels. They are heavy girls and are still my lifelong friends . I think most guys assume that hot girls only hang out with other equally hot girls and these guys were horny assholes that just wanted to bang. Which brings me to my next point…4) I get treated like an object. Often. I am used to it now, and I write it off, but guys see girls like me as an accessory. And I’m far too outspoken to be somebody’s eye candy.5) I feel expected to be basic. I’m an outdoorsy, grungy backpacker. I like camping, not wearing makeup, CrossFit, and other masculine activities. A lot of the men I’ve dated are taken aback and other girls I associate with seem to think the key to attracting a man here in Orange County, California is to do my hair perfectly even at the gym, always have perfect gel manicured nails, designer clothes and to not talk too much and give simple answers when dating. I feel like I’m supposed to look like a Barbie and act like deaf mute. Before, I relied heavily on my personality to make friends and date. Now it seems like it’s frowned upon because I have to “make them work for it” and the kinds of guys that want to go out with a girl like me are not looking for good conversation as much as they are looking for a pretty lady to accompany them to parties.6) I have more opportunities. It’s amazing really. Now that I’m almost 30 and I’ve been thin for about 7 years, I’ve noticed that with age, both men and women alike treat me with respect. It is easier to meet people, go places, and get help in times of need. It’s pretty crazy how many people have stopped to try to help me in when I was traveling abroad just because I looked lost. And someone once called me an Uber (and paid for it) when my phone was dead and I lost my friends outside of a crowded bar. One time when my tire popped on the street, a guy driving behind me went out of his way to help me change the tire and offered to call AAA in case the spare didn’t work.Ultimately people notice you more and care more about pleasing you. But often there is stigma attached. People assume you are snooty, too good for them or that you’ve always had things handed to you. Not the case for me. I worked my ass off to get where I am, I am far from stuck up and I’m attracted to good personalities rather hot bodies. The drastic changes however are still very eye opening to me to this day. Thanks for reading :)	I have been at both ends of the spectrum.During my teen years, I was chubby, short, had acne rosacea, glasses, braces, and I was a smart but shy music nerd. I felt invisible and self-conscious. I hardly have any pictures of that time. Some people said unkind things about my appearance that I still remember to this day.When I hit my growth spurt, lost the weight, my braces came off, got contact lenses, my skin recovered, and my confidence grew with having to interact with more people in university and my career, it was a stark difference in how I was treated as an individual. I wasn’t invisible anymore. Over time I’ve learned to value my health above all, and regard my body as the only one we are given so it’s best to take good care of it and treat it with respect.There were stares and double-takes.Random people would start to compliment me on my appearance such as my outfit, or my lipstick, or what do I use for skincare. They would say it plainly: “You’re so pretty!” or “Why are you not modeling somewhere right now?” Comments from people young or old, male or female. It seems like people are more comfortable approaching you if you’re attractive to say something nice, and certainly I’ve learned to accept their compliments graciously with thanks.I noticed that I would get better treatment and service, whether it’s in town or traveling abroad.For the most part, it is great. And especially nowadays, people practically faint when I tell them I’m 38 - they then try to grab the attention of whoever else is in the nearby vicinity and bellow out my age like it’s a public service announcement because I look younger now than I did when I was 18. So there’s that.Sometimes, I do sense some jealousy because I’ve heard some comments like “skinny bitch” in the dressing room or “did you get plastic surgery?” These untrue comments don’t bother me, as the comments I had when I was unattractive were far worse.I’m quite observant and find attractiveness in everyone. I always try to tell a person if possible what I find beautiful or attractive about them ie. Hey, awesome shoes, man! Love your hair colour! You have THE best smile…If you would like to experience the peak of feeling “attractive”, I recommend doing an all-inclusive photo shoot package in Hong Kong where they take care of everything to make you feel ultra glam - from taking your photos in a gorgeous studio, doing your hair and makeup, outfitting you in multiple changes of fantastical attire, PLUS they provide you lunch!
is it possible to do ca after 12th science	what should be done further to apply for phd fellowship from a government institution if i have cleared tifr gs 2016 written test	0	Definitely Yes. Let me tell my own experience. I had completed 12th Science from WB Board with 75% in 2015. I was not very clear about my goals and after discussing with my parents I decided to chose CA. I registered for CPT Dec 15. I had 4.5 months from Aug- Dec . I thought it would be better to focus on self study because I did not know the very basics of accounting and other commerce subjects and no teacher will teach the very basics. I studied for 4.5 months and cracked CPT with 70%.What I have learnt is that CA needs perseverance or consistency. If you study daily for 5–6 hours then you can definitely clear cpt.Best of Luck!!	In general, any type of score that is local to a country or region is only considered by that local regional places. By any means, that doesnt mean the scoring methodology or the score itself is not good. It just means that specific score is not commonly used across the world and people/universities are not aware of it. I know TIFR is a good institution but not sure how you can use that score in your applications anywhere.In general, for PhD admissions, scores (GRE, TOEFL etc) are of less relevant since they do not reflect your strengths in the field. As long as you have good enough scores your application will be considered.In this context, you have to refer to the specific college admissions procedure to understand what their requirements are and what can you do further to apply to that specific institution. In west, each PhD awarding dept and each individual in the program are unique. There is no such thing as common denominator that will help you in the admissions. Please understand admission into any other degree is mostly based on your previous scores (GRE, GPA etc…) but not PhD.
what is it like to study math at ucla	could usc buy ucla	0	I graduated from UCLA with a degree in Applied Mathematics.  The GE math classes for non-math majors are pretty big, just like every GE class for those outside a major.  For the math majors, in four years I never had a math class bigger than 30 people and some as small as seven.The biggest thing I remember many years later is how much variety in math exists once you get past calculus.  I loved actuarial mathematics, a class that used math to study traffic patterns, the classes that used basic programming/Mathematica to solve problems.  I hated set theory and non-linear equations.I'm pretty good, but there were other students that blew me away by how well they comprehended everything.  I wasn't in the same league as the top few students in the class.  (I know one went on to pursue a PhD in math at CalTech.)  The professors and TAs are all extremely intelligent, but still patient enough to help you get through a problem; but you will have to visit them during office hours and put in the effort.It is challenging, and you want to make sure you enjoy mathematics, as opposed to statistics, physics, economics, or engineering.  (One of the jokes I had with a physics major was that if something worked 10/10 times, they would assume it worked every time, where I had to go prove it worked every time.)  Studying math teaches you the analytical skills and processes to solve a variety of complex problems.	"I work in buyside finance and looked into this as a sort of fun valuation exercise. The surprising and amusing answer is yes, USC could straight up buy UCLA: land, hospital, and all.https://ucla.app.box.com/acct-pd... Referring to page 12 of the annual financial report, we see that UCLA is heavily leveraged on government backed debt. As a public university, UCLA has access to ridiculous amounts of cheap debt because its existence is secured by the government as a corollary of the University of California's mission: to educate the common people of California. Therefore, it needs little collateral to achieve high levels of leverage, theoretically past its total equity value. In this case we see an asset-debt ratio of: 9019 million / 11,694 million = 77%.Its umbrella entity, the University of California allocates funds separately across each of the UC campuses, so any loan default is further guaranteed by this larger entity. We'll note however, that on page 14 of the report, the university's bonds were dropped a grade from Aa1 to Aa2 in 2014 (a pretty big deal, comparable to US government's credit rating being downgraded from AAA to AA+ during the mortgage crisis) signifying that the rating agencies are beginning to perceive UCLA as hitting the limits of risk-free borrowing despite its innately low-risk and unexciting mission of public service. The idea is that private or public for-profit corporations can sustain a level of debt at 77% of its assets in the pursuit of near term growth, but a not-for-profit entity with no foreseeable revenue growth has no business taking on this much debt.UCLA's net position is less than $2 billion, lower than its endowment. This includes the ridiculously valuable land that UCLA sits on, which coupled with its buildings is worth $5.7 billion, half of UCLA's total asset value. A major thing contributing to UCLA's huge liability accounts are the pensions and benefits owed to retirees.http://about.usc.edu/files/2014/... On the other hand, many would observe USC's balance sheet and see it as an investor's dream. It takes on $2.5 billion in debt, which is barely half its yearly revenues. From a financial perspective, USC is under utilizing debt, but obviously cannot effectively acquire the same levels of leverage as UCLA, as USC is a private entity without the government guarantee and interest subsidies UCLA as access to. USC is the far more financially sustainable institution, sitting at a net position of $7.46 billion, which is... a lot more than UCLA, almost 3.75x to be exact. To achieve this, USC has had to cross some large chasms in the past, such as in the relative value of its land and buildings ($2.9 billion compared to UCLA's $5.7 billion). The fact that it's even in the same magnitude says a lot about the success of USC's financial strategy over the long term. While UCLA is situated on far more valuable land that has benefited from enormous appreciation AND owns more acreage, its buildings are older and are beginning to hit their depreciation limit, while USC has been injecting literally billions into new buildings for its campus and surrounding area over the past decade or two. USC owns the majority of off-campus student housing in the University Park area, including the under-construction University Village. In addition, Pat Haden's efforts led USC to snagging the 99-year lease on the Coliseum involving rights to all revenues... just one year before news comes out that an NFL team will be moving to LA. And along with them 3-4 years of ticket sales to USC as the Rams await the construction of their own stadium. Someone there is making some good decisions.If we were to look at UCLA to see whether or not it could be reasonably ""bought"" by USC, we'd have to first take the factors established above and temporarily suspend disbelief in placing a market value on the UCLA campus and owned entities. If UCLA was floated at the value of its assets minus liabilities i.e. book value, it would only be worth $1.9 billion. If it was floated at 1x its revenues, it would be worth $4.9 billion. For a non-profit entity with no predicted revenue growth, I would say these numbers provide a reasonable lower and upper bound. Unfortunately, I can't apply an EBIDTA multiple to this valuation as UCLA is operating at a loss of $1.081 billion, subsidized by $268 million in private gifts and $242 million in injections from the University of California, both highly unsustainable income streams.Applying the above valuation metrics towards USC as a corporation, we would arrive at a tentative market value of around 3 times as much. If anything were to kill this deal, it would be USC's public finance investment bankers snapping them out of wanting to acquire an entity that's bleeding a billion dollars a year.Let's say UCLA is valued anywhere in between its present book value and estimated market value inclusive of goodwill ($1.9-4.9 billion). USC presently holds $450 million in cash. If they were to structure a leveraged buy-out at the standard ratio of 10% equity to 90% debt, they would have $4.5 billion purchasing power. This is just short of buying up only UCLA's land and buildings ($5.7 bil) as standalone assets, but quite reasonably enough to buy the whole of UCLA inclusive of its liens and liabilities. The $4 billion debt stack would be secured by USC's other assets and revenue generating holdings. If USC were to borrow the full amount necessary to buy UCLA, they would still have less debt than UCLA does currently - both as a flat amount and in proportion to their assets: (2516 + 4000) = 6516 million (65%) vs. 9019 million (77%) respectively.Of course, whether the UC Regents would just go ahead and agree to selling their #2 campus is another matter. Leveraged buyouts don't quite work the same way when there are no shareholders. Furthermore, there is an invisible line of credit that comes out of the University of California that can't be accounted for as we don't know how much the Regents would commit to shielding UCLA from a stock buyout in the event of a hostile takeover. By exposing the equity holdings of the other 9 UC campuses in a poorly executed takeover defense, such as by splitting its equity stack but failing to unload all of its shares in time, USC could just buy a 51% ownership stake and accidentally end up with controlling interest in all 10 UC campuses. Woops. Might be better to not risk the body for the limb.In any case, it's evident that the UCs aren't in fantastic shape financially, which can be deceptive if you're only looking at budget and endowment figures, for which these two institutions aren't that far apart. While it looked like business went on as usual for public universities post-recession, their issues were really just swept under an enormous rug of debt. It's not like USC is quite as wealthy as Harvard or Yale, but USC does look like it's in a place where it has a ton of financial headroom for expansion that it hasn't yet begun utilize. If the world of public finance was quite as cutthroat and unregulated as buyside corporate finance, I wouldn't be surprised if UCLA would have been renamed USC Westwood years ago. Then again, in this fictional dystopia, everyone would probably be attending one of Harvard Corporation's 100 campuses."
what is the best lesson in life	what is the most important lesson you have learned from life	1	Like all the engineers, I also had a dream. To get placed in an MNC with decent package. I studied in a good college, got great grades and got placed in a reputed MNC. I still remember the day when I got placed. Everyone was happy for me. My father, mother, brother, sister. I can even remember the lines that everyone told me.Father: I knew it. Well done. I am proud of you.Mother: God bless you son. You fulfilled my dream.Brother: Well done. Congrats.Sister: Many congratulations brother. You are the best.I was very happy not because I got a job but because of the happiness that my whole family was cherishing at that moment of life. I became the prime member of the family. I felt like I am something that matters. With all the happiness and dreams in my eyes, I started my journey of corporate life, in none other than the place, the dream city, Mumbai.Everything was going great. Initial training was going on. After 15 days of training, I heard a rumor that, due to some bullshit reason company was firing some GET’s. I quickly reached to the notice board. There I saw, my name was also on the list. I couldn’t believe that. I immediately rushed to the HR team and they confirmed the news. I was not able to believe that. How they could do that. We were not even completed our training. How could they judge someone without giving them a chance? I argued but neither they listened, nor they cared. I even pleaded before them that my whole career is at stake, but they told me that either take the reliving or they will be forced to fire me. Anyways, I didn’t have any option but to receive one-month salary and get relieved.They already gave me late joining. Almost one year after I got placed. And now, they fired me for no reason. It also disabled me to get job in other companies because neither I was fresher, nor I had any experience. All my dreams, my parents hope and everything else, got lost.I called my brother. We discussed the matter and I came back to Delhi. The most difficult part was to face the parents. I was not able to tell them the truth for some months because I didn’t want to break the belief that they had in me. But that was not the end of my problems. That was just the beginning.Two Years laterI still didn’t have any job. I tried in many companies, but my year gap was making it very difficult. I prepared for GATE, but I didn’t get IIT’s, so I decided not to join any other college. I had computer science in my B tech and eventually I got a project also, but they closed the deal. So, my hunt was still on to get success and so was my failures. I also had education loan and it’s soaring interest rate was making it difficult to repay. In India, you can get cheaper car loan, house loan, and even personal loan but you can’t get cheaper education loan.In totality, after wasting two precious years of my life, I failed to get a job, I failed to get admission in IIT’s, I failed to complete the project, I failed to repay my education loan, etc. I failed in so many things that I couldn’t even imagine. Everyone who was once proud of me were trying to hide my failures. My parents used to say to our relatives that I wanted to study further, that’s why, I left the job. Once an asset became the liability.That was the stage of my life when all my friends were talking about SIP’s, weekends plan, Goa tour, getting a girlfriend, etc and I was just thinking to get a job. My frustration was at its peak and I even stopped talking with everyone to avoid questions related to my career.One day, my brother came to meet me.He: How are you? You look weak.Me: Yeah. I used to awake late at night.He: Why, what you do?Me: Nothing.He: What do you mean by nothing. Do something.Me: What you expect me to do. I immediately got annoyed and answered rudely. You will not understand, how it feels, when you lose everything especially your job. I am nothing but a loser.He: Who said you are a loser. You are my brother and I know you. You are our biggest asset. As far as job concern, Job is not a criterion to judge your success. It is just a step towards success. He said very calmly.Me: I am sorry brother for my behavior. I was just upset. I said softly.He: It’s okay. Don’t worry you will get success with flying colors.Me: But brother, I failed in so many things.He: He smiled in answer and said. Don’t fail until you fail.I also replied with a smile.One year after that incidentIn one sentence, I learnt everything about the life. I understood that this is not the job that was my biggest problem. The problem, that haunting me was to carry the burden of making it secret from everyone that I am jobless. So, I told everyone that I lost my job and from past two years I was not working anywhere but I will get it within 1 year. I felt relieved after that and then there was no burden on me. I didn’t fail. So, I decided to take the first step towards the success. I worked hard and prepared for government services. Perhaps fortune favors the brave. Now, I am posted in a leading bank. It gave me a flat also. I am leaving it to you people, to guess, where I am posted now. I already repaid my education loan. In past 2 years, I have visited Goa 4 times. I started my SIP’s and I have a girlfriend also. Finally, I am an asset now.It is the real story of a person, who is part of my heart and I am very proud of him.	Ten weeks ago I was at my wife's business and my daughters phoned to tell me that she wouldn't be home till late as she and her boyfriend were going out. Fifteen minutes later she phoned again, but this time it was a stranger asking for Tyler's mum or dad and that Tyler's car had been in a crash (it was hit by a speeding unmarked police car) and that she was ok but they were waiting for an ambulance.I got the address and was there within 8 minutes. It was horrific, my daughter was still trapped in the car, the firemen were just starting to cut the roof and doors off of the car. Tyler was sitting in the passenger seat being supported from behind by a fireman who was stopping her from moving. She was covered in blood with a gash across her clearly broken nose.Because her car ended up knocking over and on top of a cable cupboard with live electricity it took over an hour and a half to get her out and on the way to hospital. They took her to the Royal London, which has a specialist trauma unit. At the hospital they found that she had broken her neck. The fracture being of the C2, which is also known as the hangman's fracture. The Neurosurgeon told me that if the fireman had not held her for that hour and a half to stop her moving she would almost certainly be either paralysed or dead.In the end she was in hospital for a week and she still has an Aspen brace on her neck, which hopefully will be able to come off in a few weeks after more scans. Her scars are healing well.I learnt that one'’s life can change in a second, through no fault or cause of your own and that you have to make the most of every minute.​You can just make out the fireman supporting my daughter. He is a hero.
how will trump  presidency affect indian students who are planning to do a phd in america	how would trump presidency affect indian students in america	1	I don’t talk about personal politics on public forums; instead, I will stick to facts as much as possible. In short, everything below I believe to be true, but not everything I believe is true is written below. (-:It’s far too early to know for sure exactly what the impact will be. As of this writing (mid-Nov 2016) we don’t even know who is going to be in key policy positions. Then, we don’t know how the Senate and House will react to their policy views. We don’t know how much party-line—crossing there will be; likely very little for the most part, but that is harder to predict if a policy is clearly prejudicial or damaging to the economy at large.Now, in terms of impact, there are personal impacts and job impacts.In terms of job impacts, it seems highly unlikely that anyone who is well-educated will do poorly in the short term. The US has tremendous economic opportunities for people who are skilled in high-value fields. Those companies are not going to fill their jobs out of nowhere. If the government starts to put in place policies that make it difficult to hire talented employees, companies will take those positions to where the employees are — abroad — creating exactly the opposite situation of what Trump promised when he ran. Of course, politics rarely follows along strictly rational lines of calculation, but ultimately it’s therefore important to separate bluster for the press versus what actually happens quietly in the background.Keep in mind, also, that if the job market does change by the time you graduate, unless the Revolution comes, you’re hardly the one who will be impacted. Anyone who is willing to pick up sticks, move half-way around the world, deal with differences in language and food and climate and a dozen other things, is likely going to have a place somewhere in the world. Getting a quality education can only help that.In terms of personal impacts, it might depend quite a bit on what you look like — in some locations. However, the vast majority especially of US research universities are not located in the places that are also appear to be the most prejudiced. Indeed, this election further widened the gap between urban and rural areas, and urban areas resoundingly voted for a more global perspective. A student at Brown doesn’t live in the USA as much as they live in Providence, a vibrant, multi-cultural town with numerous nationalities and races represented broadly. Inasmuch as you think the vote for Trump says anything, only about five states gave Clinton a higher percentage of vote (and not by much) than Rhode Island. So to someone who lived here, on a day-to-day basis, there would hardly be any perceptible difference in treatment. If anything, at this moment many people are especially sensitive and careful about how they treat others.It is also easy to forget how much progress has been made in the US. People reading about the election from a distance, getting news dominated by Trump, might be surprised to hear that in this election season, the US has voted in [list courtesy Brighten Godfrey]:Stephanie Murphy (FL) — first Vietnamese-American woman elected to CongressCatherine Cortez Masto (NM) — first Latina elected to U.S. SenatePramila Jayapal (WA) — first person of South Asian descent elected to House of RepresentativesKamala Harris (CA) — first person of South Asian descent elected to U.S. SenateIlhan Omar (MN) — first Somali-American legislator (she was elected to the state house of representatives)Kate Brown (OR) — first openly LGBTQ governorTammy Duckworth (IL) — first female senator that has seen combat, and second Asian-American female senatorSamuel Park (GA) — first openly gay man in the Georgia legislatureand so on. I bet those stories were not covered in the international press. Note that Ilhan Omar is openly Muslim, and even wears a hijab. There are many Muslim countries where she could not even stand for election.Finally, just remember that eight years ago the USA voted in its first black president. Things go in cycles.

what are the various batman movies in the series in order	what is the order of the batman arkham games	0	Everybody has given you the straight answer you need, so I’m gonna go down a slightly different path.I recently watched them in chronological order according to internal timeline of the Batman universe, as opposed to the order of the movies as they were made (and which franchises they belonged to), it was kinda like reading the different Batman comic titles simultaneously and allowing for different artists and writers interpretation, but following an “internally logical” chronology.So, I watched them in the following order:1.Batman Begins - You get an origin story and see his first steps in Gotham.2.Batman - You see him beginning to become recognised figure in Gotham and you see the birth of the joker3.Batman Returns - You get the continuation of Batman’s story and the origins of The Penguin and Catwoman.4.The Dark Knight - You get the further exploits of the joker, the birth of two face.5.Batman Forever (barely passable but I allowed it because I was a Jim Carrey fan back in the day) - You get the further exploits of Two-Face and an intro to The Riddler. You also get Dick Grayson’s Robin.6.The Dark Knight Rises - Introduction of Bane and and Talia Ah Ghul. Passing reference to a new Robin (even if it doesn’t follow canon, there have been at least five universally recognised Robins so this kinda fits.)7.Batman Vs Superman: Dawn of Justice - You get the BMvSM storyline and the set up for Justice League which of course are both major parts of the batman mythos.You, of course, have to take into consideration that movies like to kill off characters at the end of one film. But much like the comics Villains keep coming back from the dead.	The earliest game in the series in chronological order is Arkham Origins. It was released in 2013 and was the only one to be developed by WB Games Montreal. In terms of Batman's history, the games takes place around Bruce Wayne's second year as Batman and shows him dealing with supervillains for the first time.Arkham Asylum was the first game to be released in the series but takes place about five years after Origins. Furthermore, it was developed by Rocksteady Studios and released back in 2009. The game also features a more experienced Batman, with his rogues gallery now fully established.In 2011, Rocksteady released the sequel to Asylum known as Arkham City. The latter takes place about a year after the former and shows part of Gotham City being closed off to form the bigger prison Arkham City. We also got to see characters such as the Penguin, Two-Face and Mr Freeze introduced to the series.In 2015, Arkham Knight was released and served as the final game in Rocksteady’s trilogy and the series as a whole. This games takes place about a year after City and shows Batman dealing with the fallout of the previous game's events.Therefore, by the end of the series Bruce has been operating as Batman for almost ten years.
what are the best daily life hacks one can use to make his life easy	what are the hacks in daily life	1	This one hack can sure as hell help you save minutes and in some cases hours of your day.Remember the last time when you SNOOZED the alarm, not once but thrice and finally woke up an hour later.Also, remember how you got guilty later wasting that one hour and probably missing the breakfast (used to happen a lot with me since I live in a hostel)We all face this daily or at best on weekends when we do not really have to compulsorily wake up on time.After months of this routine I realized no matter how big was the urge of going back to sleep and snoozing that alarm, every time I splashed my face with water, suddenly the sleep ceased to occur. But that’s obvious, ain’t it?.Now, the major hurdle was to get up and walk those 10 long steps to the wash basin and splash.So I thought of this,A simple spray neck (one those barbers use) on a normal bottle beside my bed.Now, every time the alarm beeps and I wake up, first thing I do is immediately splash my face with this sprayer.Thank you.I am always up for a debate.If you are too, ping me Jayesh Ghatkar .

how much weight will i lose by not eating for a week	how much weight do i lose by purging after every time i eat	0	You asked,How many pounds will I lose if do not eat for a week?About ten pounds.If you have never fasted before, your weight loss will be dramatic in the first few days and then less so each day as you continue in the fast.  For example, in long fasts daily weight loss can be reduced to as little as 4 ounces a day in autophagy for fuel consumption (i.e. close to your basal metabolic rate calculated with full digestive rest) and that's after losing two to three pounds a day.[NOTE: you actually don't lose a lot of water weight in a fast and in fact get more hydrated throughout a fast. Check out your body water composition next time you fast and be amazed how your percentages rise – I've been measured by bioelectric impedance to have started out with a ~65% hydration baseline and risen to over 72% during fasts... trending back towards our natal baseline of 75% water of when we were babies.]In all fasts autophagy of some muscle tissue (protein) occurs and is consumed for fuel only in the first days of the fast, or until the body fully transitions into a ketosis metabolism.  Ketosis means your body will run near exclusively on fat (adipose tissue consumption) as well as any other non-adipose tissues that are damaged and need be recycled.  In most men ketosis happens on average after about 72 hours of fasting and in only 48 hours for women.  Veterans of fasting can drop into ketosis in a matter of hours.Additionally, muscle tissue (protein) on our body weighs much more than fat (adipose tissue) does, but muscle tissue only offers less than half the energy (at 4 calories per gram) than fat tissue does (at 9 calories per gram) when being consumed. Our bodies are not stupid and prefer using fat for fuel for obvious economic reasons, both during fasts and regular feeding periods... if you eat correctly.  And this is also how average weight loss per day tends to drop in fasts, and why people should not be surprised to experience diminishing returns when pursuing  fasts solely for weight loss.  Fat loss is all in the keto-adapted diet and metabolism that burns fat and in getting your basal metabolic rate up while cultivating that diet... rapid weight loss is not always what you want.	So I’ve actually done this before and the way your question is worded I’m guessing so have you?I was doing an internship during summer break while I was going to college. I don’t think it is necessary to go into the reasons why I did what I did; however, after doing it for around 4 to 6 weeks I noticed that it really wasn’t helping me lose weight. Now I wouldn’t do it after every meal, but I did it enough, at least once a day, sometimes two, 4 to 6 days a week. I would think that should count for something! So I started researching it and what I learned is that in many cases, your body has already done a lot of digesting by the time you get to your “place of purge.”From the time you start eating, to the time you finish, how long does that normally take? Your body goes to work doing it’s thing as soon as you see food. So the second that first bite hits your tummy its going to town doing what it does best. By the time you finish your last bite you’ve already digested a fair amount of the food you ate. And if you’re out with friends and family, or your at home with family around, it’s going to take even longer for you to get to a place where you can do it without them noticing (I assume you don’t want anyone to know…). -I guess if you live alone and you down a pint of Ben & Jerry’s in under 5 minutes every night your results may be different-Eventually I realized that it just wasn’t worth the pain and suffering of barfing and I stopped. Puking sucks mega hard, especially when you’re puking up stomach acid and half digested food. I’ve found very few foods that taste the same coming up as they did going down.I’m not here to judge you, or tell you to stop. I’m not going to tell you to go get professional help because its dangerous and you could die, blah blah blah. I know the mind set of bulimia because I experienced it and I know that most of the answers you’re going to read will not change your plans. You’re going to do what you want to do and I respect whatever you decide. All I can do is share my experiences and answer your question - How much weight do you lose after purging?Well, not including water weight, you probably are not losing that much. If you compare the weight you’d lose by taking a dump after a meal to the weight you’d lose by puking after a meal, it would be a small amount. If losing weight is your goal, you should probably find something that is 1) more socially acceptable and 2) works better. If you eat a crazy meal one day, try fasting for 12 -24 hours the next day. What that’s doing is taking that crazy meal and spreading it out over 2 days! Not as bad that way, in fact it’s probably better than if you were to eat 2 normal meals over the course of 2 days!Whatever you end up doing, just make sure you don’t lose sight of your goals. If your goal is to lose weight (fat) there are easier/faster/healthier ways than purging. If your goal is to feel immediate satisfaction followed by guilt, well you might want to take a few minutes and rethink your goals. I wish you the best of luck!

how do atm machines work internally	how does atm transaction work	0	How Do ATMs Work?An ATM is simply a data terminal with two input and four output devices. Like any other data terminal, the ATM has to connect to, and communicate through, a host processor. The host processor is analogous to an Internet service provider (ISP) in that it is the gateway through which all the various ATM networks become available to the cardholder (the person wanting the cash).Most host processors can support either leased-line or dial-up machines. Leased-line machines connect directly to the host processor through a four-wire, point-to-point, dedicated telephone line. Dial-up ATMs connect to the host processor through a normal phone line using a modem and a toll-free number, or through an Internet service provider using a local access number dialed by modem.Leased-line ATMs are preferred for very high-volume locations because of their thru-put capability, and dial-up ATMs are preferred for retail merchant locations where cost is a greater factor than thru-put. The initial cost for a dial-up machine is less than half that for a leased-line machine. The monthly operating costs for dial-up are only a fraction of the costs for leased-line.The host processor may be owned by a bank or financial institution, or it may be owned by an independent service provider. Bank-owned processors normally support only bank-owned machines, whereas the independent processors support merchant-owned machines.Parts of the MachineYou're probably one of the millions who has used an ATM. As you know, an ATM has two input devices:Card reader - The card reader captures the account information stored on the magnetic stripe on the back of an ATM/debit or credit card. The host processor uses this information to route the transaction to the cardholder's bank.Keypad - The keypad lets the cardholder tell the bank what kind of transaction is required (cash withdrawal, balance inquiry, etc.) and for what amount. Also, the bank requires the cardholder's personal identification number (PIN) for verification. Federal law requires that the PIN block be sent to the host processor in encrypted form.And an ATM has four output devices:Speaker - The speaker provides the cardholder with auditory feedback when a key is pressed.Display screen - The display screen prompts the cardholder through each step of the transaction process. Leased-line machines commonly use a monochrome or color CRT (cathode ray tube) display. Dial-up machines commonly use a monochrome or color LCD.Receipt printer - The receipt printer provides the cardholder with a paper receipt of the transaction.Cash dispenser - The heart of an ATM is the safe and cash-dispensing mechanism. The entire bottom portion of most small ATMs is a safe that contains the cash.Sensing BillsThe cash-dispensing mechanism has an electric eye that counts each bill as it exits the dispenser. The bill count and all of the information pertaining to a particular transaction is recorded in a journal. The journal information is printed out periodically and a hard copy is maintained by the machine owner for two years. Whenever a cardholder has a dispute about a transaction, he or she can ask for a journal printout showing the transaction, and then contact the host processor. If no one is available to provide the journal printout, the cardholder needs to notify the bank or institution that issued the card and fill out a form that will be faxed to the host processor. It is the host processor's responsibility to resolve the dispute.Besides the electric eye that counts each bill, the cash-dispensing mechanism also has a sensor that evaluates the thickness of each bill. If two bills are stuck together, then instead of being dispensed to the cardholder they are diverted to a reject bin. The same thing happens with a bill that is excessively worn, torn, or folded.The number of reject bills is also recorded so that the machine o...	Well the ATM is connected to a network. When you swipe or insert your card and request X amount of money the ATM sends a request to a centralized system for verification that you have the amount of money your asking for in your account and that the pin you entered is correct. The system then sends a signal back verifying that yes you do or don't have the amount requested.The CPU in the ATM then sends a dispense command to the dispenser telling it to dispense X amount of money. Remember this all happens in a matter of seconds.
how many mechanical engineers graduate from india per year	how many mechanical engineers graduate per year in india	1	Almost 1.5 million engineers pass out every year in India. Suppose mechanical engineers be 1/6 assuming equal distribution of students among 6 main branches of engineering the total number would be around 2,66,666.  This is count of pass out engineers. Students studying would be this into 4 i.e. students in all 4 years of engineering. The count will be approximately 11 lac. I think this gives you a clear idea of the scenario.

how do i start a successful private equity firm	what do you need to start your own private equity firm	1	Technically not very different than a hedge fund.  Gather seed investment capital, and start investing - make decent returns - raise more capital - repeat.  However, that's where the similarities between HF and PE ends.  The actual investment process couldn't be more different.People often say that anybody can start a HF, and it's true, investing $10M in securities isn't all that different than investing $1,000.  Picking the right stocks can be very difficult however, so while getting a good performance is difficult, just getting the fund started is easy.PE is the opposite, it's easy to find right investments, but it's much harder to actually place the investment.Easier to make returns:Let's say I buy some shares of Apple, say $1,000,000 worth of stock.  Now, to make return, I just sit back and wait for the stock to pop - and cross my fingers the mgmt doesn't mess up.  And may be also pray that the board decides to increase dividend.  Obviously, this leaves lot of room for error, to make a good investment, not only does the financials and valuations need to make sense, but the key players - mgmt/board must do the right thing.  This is a lot to get it right.But, what if I give you full control of Apple after you invest the money.  So, say I invested the same $1M into Apple.  But this time, I can control the company's capital structure.  So, first thing I do after investing is payout the most of Apple's cash as special dividend, based on Apple's current cash holdings, it'd be about 20% of the market cap.  So, right off the bat, I get 20% of my original investments back.  Then I look at Apple's capital structure and see that it hardly has any debt.  Based on its FCF of $120B per year, Apple can easily issue $300B 5 year bond at low interest rates.  Take the $300B, then pay that out as dividend as well.  That gives you additional 60% of your original investment back.  So, now, all you invested in Apple is $200k, and you successfully minimized $1M investment's exposure down to $200k.  Now, your plan is to exit your investment at year 5, after you pay off your $300B bond - if Apple does exactly as well as it does today, no better or no worse, at year four, your investment should be worth $800k, and you'd have made 400% return on your investments in 5 years.  Not bad.  That's not all, to squeeze more juice and improve the financials around your exit time, you can stop much of long term R&D activities and save money, in the old days, you could also reduce salary and increase stock options, but GAAP put a stop to that practice by requiring options to be expensed right away.  Also, you can start selling parts of the company that the public doesn't care about, say Apple has a publishing arm that prints all its manuals, designs and makes packagings, it's likely that Apple's valuation won't be affected even if you sell it off.  So, you sell those units that the public doesn't know or care about, generating extra returns.  You can also fire a bunch of people particularly in non-production roles, this will improve your financials and you can generate higher valuation on your exit.  Then you sell the company by taking it public.  Of course, not all PE shops do this, and this type of activities were much more prevalent in the old days when people weren't aware of these tricks.  However, my point is that PE shops have lot of recourses to make their investments perform.  One more thing, PE managers also pay themselves fee when they close a deal, typically in 2-3% of the investment made.  This fee is paid right away and comes out of the fund.But harder to place an investmentThe difficulty is in actually closing a deal.  Let's say you somehow raised $100M and set up a PE shop without any experience in banking and without network of business managers and bankers.  Now, your job is to buy a company.  How do you do that?  Hiring a team of bankers is easy enough, and perhaps they can get you few meetings with company managements, but you'll hit an immediate road block there.  If you're the management of the company, when a PE approaches you, they're not only looking to be an investor in your company, but also trying to be your boss.  More often than not, PE will lay you off after they buy your company.  So, what mgmt often does is to talk to their board and investors that PE is bad news - if you have no credibility as a PE, it'd be rather easy for mgmt to brush off your attempts.  Even if you somehow get the mgmt to get on board by offering lots of severance and paying high premium in valuation, you probably still won't be able to close the deal.  Because, PE buyouts are typically leveraged buyouts - meaning that you need to borrow money to complete your purchase.  If you don't have cred in PE, not only bank syndicate will require higher equity ratio (which will destroy your economics) and higher rates, it probably won't go through - they don't like the risk of investing in a rookie PE shop.  This is the main reason why almost every single PE founders have very senior level banking experience, while HF founders have varied backgrounds from college dropouts to consultants to bankers to business owners.EDIT:  Let me be clear on one thing, buying $5-10M small business or startup venture is *NOT* what I'm talking about here.  Technically that's private equity too, but it really isn't.  I'm talking about $1B+ enterprise value private equity deal that involves syndicated leveraged financing.

what are most underrated date activities	what is the most underrated activity	0	> Visiting an Art Gallery> Exploring the city> Lying in a pretty parkThese are 3 generic ideas that it seems aren't common, or at least not amongst young people, yet can be absolutely fantastic. I’m sure there are many more but these are ones I’ve had recent experience with and can recommend.	"SleepThese days it has become very common among the youngsters to sleep very late say 2 AM, 2.30 AM. And get up at 7 AM something, rush to our college/work. Then come back exhausted in the evening, do what is called as catching up on sleep for some time, then the same cycle repeats.Were we humans programmed for such a lifestyle when we evolved to what we are today? The answer is an obvious NO. Let’s try to understand the importance of sleep for our body.The term “body clock” which in a vague sense refers to our sleep timings, hunger etc. A more technical term for it is Circadian rhythm which is defined as a biological process which is periodic and keeps repeating itself roughly after 24 hours in sync with the surrounding environment. In human body this involves oscillations on a daily basis in the levels of one particular hormone called Melatonin. This hormone is secreted by the pineal gland situated in the brain. During daytime when there is light, this gland is inactive and when darkness truly seeps in (before the invention of the light bulb) secretes this hormone which induces sleep. Then again the next morning roughly after 10-12 hours when light is back, the gland switches off and the hormone’s levels in the blood fall drastically. Hence the primary function of this hormone seems to be to induce sleep.[1][2]To quote some popular culture, this hormone shows Vampire like behavior, coming out in the dark and vanishing during daytime.That’s why we have night shift workers whose sleep patterns are even more erratic which is a major cause for worry as there have been reports that among that class of people cancer occurrences have been pretty high.[3]When investigations were carried out into the causes for the Chernobyl disaster and the Challenger Space Shuttle’s accident, one of the reasons found was poor judgment and decisions from the sleep deprived, tired workers. That’s enough to show the dangers sleep deprivation holds.[4]Sleep is God, go worship!- Jim ButcherFootnotes[1] Melatonin: Never Ignore This ""Wonder Hormone""[2] Why do we sleep?[3] The Health Risks of Shift Work[4] 5 Other Disastrous Accidents Related To Sleep Deprivation"

Imagine that you are thirsty and that you are looking for a water source, after walking a few blocks you find a hydrand where water is coming out at a HUGE rate and a HUGE pressure. Now your task is to drink all the water without letting a single drop spill on the ground.Thats probablly a very good analogy to MechE, because of the ammount of different material that you cover, you will learn electrical engineering, computer science, computer engineering, material science, civil engineering, Fluid mechanics, Thermodynamics, Physics, control systems, Vibrations, Heat transfer, Physics, Chemistry, Math, etc.I will never forget that when I took Mechanical Components, every chapters was a totally different class. For instance chapter one was all about electronics and responses, chapter 2 was all about thermodynamics , chapter 3 all about fluids, chapter 4 all about strain gages, etc.My advice will be to try to teach yourself Computer Science specially Matlab and be good at it!PS: I am not saying all of this to discourage you, just be aware that there will be alot of material and good luck!

why is quora digest filled with questions about google iq and china	why are there so many questions about iq questions on quora	0	That’s a great question, I’ve been wondering that myself. I can only assume that these are the questions and answers that people are interested in. But you’re not alone in being disappointed with the focus on weapons. Other questions on Quora include:Why do I get so many questions about weapons and warfare in my Quora emails? There are barely any when I visit the site.Why is my Quora top feed 90% full questions about guns, weapons, war or the military? I’m really not that interested!But we’re not the only ones with complaints about the prevalence of things we’re not interested in:Why is Quora Digest filled with questions about Google, IQ, and China?Philip	The reason for so many IQ questions is because either some people feel like their self value revolves around their IQ, some people are not successful so to make them feel special they say that they have a high IQ to make people think that they are smart so they mean something, some people have nothing in life by which I mean they are not sporty, not handsome, not good at making friendships, not good at any school subjects, and in order to feel like they are good at something, they say that they have a high IQ even though they suck at every subject at school, and some people just like saying that they have a high IQ just to brag. There are many different people on quora with many different reasons to tell their IQ or to ask questions about their IQ. However, most of the time, the reason they do this is because even thought they are not good at math, not good at english/language, not good at public speaking, not good at sports, not good at acting, and etc, at least they have a high IQ to validate that they are intelligent, not any substantial evidence besides an IQ test to show that they are intelligent. They do not or did not show any giftedness in math, science, english, etc, but, hey they have a high IQ, so none of that matters to them. All they need to do is to show people they are a different kind of intellect, by that I mean a person with a high IQ, and they don’t need to be good at any subject in school to be intelligent, because to them that doesn’t matter. All that matters is having a high IQ.
how would you destroy the world	how can i destroy the world	0	Answer is : RumoursRumours which look legitimate, solid, hurtful and should produce curiosity in the buyers of rumour.Rumours spread faster than anything.A conspiracy theory suggests, america produced rumours about Iraq, having biochemical weopons, and destroyed it.Another conspiracy about Iraq and Kuwait, that they fought for the oil reserves, which were, even not present there.If you see, histroy is full of wars over rumours.But for destroying world, you need to start World War 3. And Right now, if you see the sequential enemies - friends in world i.e. America - North Korea - Japan - China - India - Pakistan - Afganistan - Russia etc. So the rumour must affect one of these regions and the cracker line is fired. Everyone will destroy each other.By the way, if World War 3 happens, everyone will be dead including you. So just don't try to do something like that. Peace..!!	No man can.Not even Dave Consiglio!Why?The Earth is big. Like, really big. All that mass holds Earth strongly together. Destroying it would involve hitting it with something roughly Earth sized or else running a black hole by it or exploding a star or some such.But no one can do those things, either. Remember, early on Earth got hit by something Mars sized. Earth survived. Besides, if we could move a planet or a black hole, we could probably just pick the Earth up and fling it into the sun, which would likely do the trick. :)Now, if you want to kill everyone, that's a different story. Nuclear weapons have been mentioned already, but honestly, I think it would be hard to kill everyone this way. Most people? Sure. But everyone? Possible, but difficult.So how do we do it? Easy. First, you get the premier of China to go on a death wish. He orders the construction of an asteroid capture mission. The purpose is to put an asteroid in orbit around the moon and study it. But, the premier then secretly sabotages the thing to deflect asteroids toward Earth. Find an asteroid more than around 20 miles across, aim for Asia, and watch the dust fly. Literally.By striking the land, you kick up enormous amounts of dust which blacken the skies and starve billions. Asia is geologically active almost everywhere, so you get enormous earthquakes and volcanic eruptions, which throw up more dust and ash. Oh, and nearly half of humanity lives in Asia, so you wipe more people out just with the impact this way.Why China? NASA and the ESA are probably too transparent and poorly funded for something like this. But China? China might just be able to pull this off.
how can i earn money from youtube	how do i make money through youtube	1	Four ways, basically:1. Ad revenue. When there's an ad on a video watch page, the creator of that video shares the revenue from that ad with YouTube. YouTubers aren't allowed to discuss ad rates, but it's generally acknowledged to be between $1 per 1,000 views, up to a few dollars per 1,000 views. Many YouTubers also make sponsored or branded content, in which they share or discuss a product for a fee. This can be very lucrative, but there's also the risk of clouding your authentic relationship with your audience.2. Merchandising. Many YouTube creators sell shirts or mugs featuring logos or inside jokes. There are companies designed for niche creators looking to make merch for their audiences (I co-own one, Don't Forget To Be Awesome). For some YouTubers, this can be a bigger source of income than ads (it is for my brother and me), but for most it's a relatively small business.3. Ancillary products. Many YouTubers are able to use their existing audiences as activation energy for other projects--from tours to music to makeup lines to books. Because many of these projects have better established business models (like, people generally expect to pay for books), this can also be a great business. It's unlikely my novel The Fault in Our Stars would've been so successful without the activation energy provided by the viewers of our videos.4. Subscription fees. This is an emerging business model, but I think a very promising one. Voluntary subscription platforms like Patreon: Support the creators you love allow viewers to support the creators they love directly. This decreases the influence of advertisers and makes creators directly answerable to their audiences. It does, however, require that a percentage of viewers choose to pay. I suspect most YouTubers make most of their money from ads, but I think advertising is probably shrinking percentage-wise as a revenue source, which I think is mostly good news. I think advertising is an important part of funding our online experiences, but ultimately I'd argue the Internet is healthiest when serving the needs of its human users rather than the needs of its corporate sponsors.	In order to start getting paid on YouTube you would start with Adsense, however since the whole Logan Paul indecent, YouTube has changed their policies . Now with Adsense and you need to have at least 1000 subscribers and at least 4000 hours of watch time as of the beginning of 2008Of course if you are just starting out , you don’t have this so here are a few ways to create a YouTube channel and make money on YouTube without AdSense1.License your content to the mediaSay you made a video and it went viral, you can offer to license it to the media such as tv news outlets, morning shows, online news site and even other creators. There are also marketplaces where you can list your content for purchase2.Affiliate MarketingAffiliate marketing is where you can earn a commission from another website for sending traffic to their site. The commission is generated through either a click or a purchase depending on the way that retailer has it set up. You can do a search and find most online retailers have it such as Walmart, Amazon, or even Etsy3.Sponsorship and brand dealsIt is a good idea to have a separate business email for your channel you never know when you may get contacted for a brand deal or sponsored video. Also, you can reach out to companies and say hey I am a youtuber and make these types of videos and think you product would be a great fit for my audience and see if they will send you some products or sponsor your video to center it around their products.4.Crowdfunding and donationsYou can add a PayPal link or use a platform to accept donations or get crowd funding from your viewers to help support your content creation.5.Marketing a business you already haveIf you already have an existing business you YouTube is a great way to market and transfer views into store visits6.Product salesYou can sell and market your own products directly on YouTube7.Website and Blog trafficIf people like your videos and you have a blog or website, let your viewers know about it and all those views can translate into traffic8.Teach online coursesIf you have a tutorial or teaching channel you can include some really valuable content that leaves your viewers wanting more and redirect them to paid online courses where they can purchase even more of you valuable content9.Rent Out your videosYou can offer to give shoutouts and links to other channels for a fee.Any or all of these methods are how to create a YouTube channel and make money Earning YouTube money is definitely easy. You just have to stay consistent, take your YouTube channel seriously, but still have fun doing it. And you will definitely see resultsWhen you are eligible to start earning from AdSense The first step is to enable monetization on your channel. In order to do this go to your channel click your icon in the top right corner, then look to the right menu and select status and features. Then go to monetization and click enable.After you enable make sure you read all the information on your screen and click start to accept the YouTube Partner Program Terms check the boxes once you read and agree then click I accept.This will take you to AdSense There you would enter in your name address and bank account information and basically connect your YouTube channel to your AdSense account and start making money. The threshold is $100 so you won’t officially get your first deposit until you reach the threshold amount.Once you actually start your channel and start making money want to keep it going .

what are the differences between particles and molecules	how can i entirely turn off syntax highlighting in sublime text for golang	0	When people speak about particles it is about stuff smaller than any molecule. Generally, about electrons, protons, neutrons, quarks, neutrinos, positrons, etc; the parts of an atom. Molecules are two or more of the same or different atoms. A molecule is the smallest building block of a substance which if continually divided in half cannot be further divided without losing the characteristics of the original substance.Molecules are made from atoms and combinations of particles creates the atom.

how do i start writing again	how do i start writing	0	There are numerous ways, the list goes.1. Start writing about the incidents of your life that you come across. It may be a conversation that you had with your parents, friends, teachers or debating news happening around the world in news channels. Write down about 2-3 incidents or stories daily.2. A good writer is a good reader. You need to read a lot of books. This would widen horizon and thoughts. Never stop reading. There exist numerous books to be read. Start with the books of your interest and then try to read the other books too which you haven't known about it well.3. A good writer is also a keen observer. Attention to details is very important whether it may be during writing or reading. Don't be a shallow reader.4. Carry a notepad with you. Whenever you come across an unknown saying or a word or an idiom or a thought, note down with examples. So that, you can start using it where ever it fits in your writing.5. Have an imaginative and creative thought while you write. To achieve that, you need to watch/read a lot of things. You can increase your creativity as much as you can by knowing about umpteen things whether it may be through a movie or a novel or a series. Grasp a lot of things that have been happening around.6. Think a lot, think deep and make a proper analysis about whatever you write.This much I can say as of now, hope you embark with it. Best of luck :)	"I've met many people who say, 'I wish I could write', or 'I've always wanted to write but I just can't'. I believe that if you can think, you can write. If you can talk, you can write. Because writing is nothing but talking... on paper. But what I do understand is that starting the process of thinking on paper is difficult. Somehow, all the thoughts that flow out in an organized, clear fashion when you are talking to your friends or family, seem to get all jumbled up and incoherent when you sit down to write them down. But ""you can't cross the sea merely by standing and staring at the water,"" as Tagore said. You have to just start writing. So that's what I'm going to talk about - how to write, i.e, how to think on paper. Unclog the brain pipesTo start writing you need to do just that: start writing. Get something to write on, clear a space to write in, put your pen to paper, and just GO! Start writing and don't stop. Don't stop to question. Don't stop to think. Don't stop to notice what rubbish might be coming out of your hand. ""I always start writing with a clean piece of paper and a dirty mind."" - writer Patrick Dennis. This is a brain detox exercise. You know how in yoga there is a detox exercise where you stick two fingers down your throat and throw up toxins? This is just that. It cleans your dirty mind. Nobody will ever read this. You don't even have to read it. This exercise has two purposes:Getting your jumble of thoughts out of you... so unclog your thinking pipes; and You will see that what was in your head is now on paper. Even if in an incoherent mumbling fashion. But now you can start to see how your logical thoughts can be put down on paper as well.Think of One Clear Idea to write aboutRemember in school, we were given a topic to write an essay on: 'TV - Is it a Boon or a Bane?' Or something like that. It's that exercise. But in this case it's easier because you can pick any topic you like and already talk about. For e.g. '10 Reasons Why My Daughter Should Not Stay Out Late at Night', or, 'Let Me Tell You Why This Government is Better/Worse Than the Last One' or whatever gets you going... Each piece you write should have one clear topic/idea/direction. Then you can develop that idea fully and not get pulled in different directions. For example, this piece is about how to get started writing for general communication. If I started talking about writing as art, for poems or novels, or different genres and languages, I'd get lost. Stay on point with one big idea. Is it really love?If you are knowledgeable and passionate about the topic you choose, it will come through loud and clear. Just like when you talk to someone passionate or energetic, their passion can be infectious, in the same way that passion can also be conveyed in writing. That is what attracts people to your writing - not merely the knowledge you share, but the passion you convey. If you care about what you're writing, others will care too. Use emotions to connect to other people. Write for someone close to youWhen I first started writing I would always start each article with 'Dear Dad, Let me tell you what I think about this topic...' And then my thoughts would flow as if I was talking to dad. (I would always remember to delete this line before submitting though!) So when you write think about talking to someone you talk to all the time, like your son. 'Beta, let me tell you why Amitabhji is an evergreen hero...' ""Writing means sharing. It's part of the human condition to want to share things - thoughts, ideas, opinions."" - writer Paulo Coelho Get up-close and personalSo get personal with your reader and share what you know and think. The reason I say imagine you are writing to someone you trust or are close to is because then you don't worry about opening yourself up. If I tell you a story as I would my best friend, you would feel connected to me. ..."
if time started because of the big bang happening then how could the big bang start because there was no time for the big bang to start	how did the big bang happen when there was not  any time for it to happen in	1	Hare Krishna,There was no Big Bang. It is a great illusion created by mental speculation.The Universe is eternal, we are eternal, and there is no beginning or ending of us or the Universe.This has been confirmed in The Bhagavad Gita, which is a summary of all Vedic knowledge.“Material nature and the living entities should be understood to be beginningless. Their transformations and the modes of matter are products of material nature.” - Bhagavad Gita, Chapter 13, Verse 20.We merely change our forms in different lives. But we are eternal beings and the Universe is also eternal. Creation and destruction are merely change in forms. The Universe itself is eternal like us, but it is merely changing its form. The changes have been taking place since eternity and will continue till eternity. We all will exist in some form or the other eternally. And this whole Universe will also exist till eternity. This is the secret of existence.Never was there a time when I did not exist, nor you, nor all these kings; nor in the future shall any of us cease to be. - Bhagavad Gita, Chapter 2, Verse 12.Creation and destruction is simply an illusion.The Universe is existing and we all are existing. The Universe was existing, and we all were existing. The Universe will be existing, and we all will be existing always, forever, eternally. Our permanent identity is devotee of Sri Krishna, Sri Krishna's permanent identity is Supreme Lord. These identities never change in past, present, or future.Currently we all have forgotten our real identity as the devotees, as the associates of Sri Krishna. Therefore this knowledge of eternal life, eternal existence has been stolen away from us by Maya (illusion). This is the root cause of all confusion and suffering in this world. We have forgotten our eternal identity as devotees of the Almighty Lord.We just have to accept these true, eternal, permanent, non-changing identities, and then all chaos and confusion will end. Everyone will become perfectly enlightened.The only problem is that we don't accept our identity as devotees, associates of the Lord. Therefore Maya has captured us all, and we are wandering here and there in search of answers.Once we accept our true identity as the devotee, as the part and parcel of the divine Lord, Maya will lose her jurisdiction over us, and all answers, all knowledge will be revealed to us from within our heart, where Sri Krishna is already sitting as the paramatma (Super Soul).It is merely a question of recognizing the Lord, and accepting our eternal relationship with Him as associates and devotees. If we act in this world with such an attitude of devotion to the Lord, everything will be clearly visible to us. There will be no place for doubt, confusion, illusion, or ignorance. Maya can be wiped out completely by the grace of Lord Krishna.Even our scientists are beginning to find what Lord Krishna has already revealed: No Big Bang? Quantum equation predicts universe has no beginningWe, the devotees of Lord Krishna, know very well that Sri Krishna is the perfect scientist because He is God.He is the original Author of the Vedas, and He has perfect knowledge about everything. He has manifested this Universe from His energy, and He is the Supreme Lord.“I am seated in everyone's heart, and from Me come remembrance, knowledge and forgetfulness. By all the Vedas am I to be known; indeed I am the compiler of Vedānta, and I am the knower of the Vedas.” - Bhagavad Gita, Chapter 15, Verse 15.Therefore we simply accept His statements as true and avoid wasting our time. We utilize this time for doing Bhakti of Lord Krishna, the supreme scientist.Our recommendation to all intelligentsia in this world is - please stop wasting so much time, money and energy in mental speculation. Simply surrender to the Supreme Scientist, Lord Krishna.

how does it feel to be in a relationship than being single and how does our life changes when we are in a relationship	why do i want to stay single all my life after my breakup why do i feel like i am done with this serious relationship thing	0	For nature lovers - Think you are walking on a road with beautiful landscapes around. so much to see - river,  mountains,  valley,  clouds,  mountains,  sea etc.For Automative lovers - you are at a a place where best of best vehicles are available and you can ride any of them for as much time you wantFor Archeology  lovers - you are visiting all of archeological places and you can wander any where over thereFor Music lovers - you have a playlist full of original compositions of your favourite singers, bands,  genre.  You have a place on you own where you can hear them as much time you want and at volumes you want toFor movie lovers - all of your favourite movies,  movies of your fav director,  actor,  actress is there with you.  You are in a room where you can watch them on your own. Popcorns coke are on full supply. For Internet keeda's - you have high bandwidth internet with no blocks of sites.  You can watch and read whatever you want.  Your mobile is with you and you can use it on your mobile too.Wow if this happens it is great na? I hope you all will say yes. But there is a twist you will be alone at all places for lifetime. You can take 1 person with you but that person cant leave you in between. Whom you will take? Your parents - you are serious then thats great but they have commitments tooYour best friend - though he says he should love this to the extent you loveYour bro / sis - they have their life dont they? Your GF / BF - they will try to convince you to go with them for their interestYour wife / husband - they are same as your gf / bf with a marriage symbol and a commitment o be with you.  Breakups in gf / bf are easy when compared with marriage breakupYour love - they will come with you and will never force even though they dont like the stuff because for them youare everything. Yes relationship is feeling ownself completely and share your deepest secrets without worrying of being  judged. If the relationship is based on love (dont consider superficial or lust) then you will feel complete. You can share all the things you do or you love with themAnd this is the difference between relationship and being single and also how you will feel omce in relationship 	To be in a relationship or not it's totally depend upon a person. Due to some circumstances, in life, there comes a time when you don't like such kind of things which hurt you in past.Right now after having 8 years of relationship you broke up and don't want to go for serious relationship again that's completely fine. It's nice to be single as you get more time to ponder about what you want in your life,once you're confirm about what you want in your life or how you want to spend your life then it's not a problem to be a single or mingle.Relationships comes with it's own set of responsibilities and after experiencing such a long time in one, it's quite hard to prepare yourself for the same.Relationships teach you a lot just accept the situation and move on but don't run away to be in a relationship. If you want to stay single all your life because of your past experience that is wrong just use it to make your life better.Thanks for A2A.
how can i start civil service exam preparation from scratch	when should i start preparing for the civil service exam	1	Detailed Account of the UPSC Preparation from scratchI feel privileged today to share my two cents on civil services preparation. Before I begin let me clearly state that there is no magic wand to clear civil services. Also there is no correlation of intelligence and high aptitude with chances of selection in civil services. Most of the people who crack it are no indifferent (at one point of time even they were a part of the herd and felt the same uncertainty of clearing up this exam).But yes something worked for them, that made them successful.I would like to list down some of the most important components which you will find common in preparation of all successful candidates. We can call them as Basic Pillars of UPSC PreparationA timetable and strategy: Nothing is possible without proper planning, a daily timetable and short/long term goals setting. So plan and timetable is the first pillar.A strong foundation and conceptual clarity: it is important to ensure whatever we read, we understand it thoroughly. UPSC questions are very much applied, they need analysis and that can come only when we are crystal clear with our concepts of subject matter.Consolidation and revision: The syllabus is like a vast ocean, it is important to keep consolidating and revising it time and again. So make notes and continuously revise every now and then.Evaluation of Preparation: At every point of time you should know where your preparation stand, that is possible through self-evaluation and evaluation through tests.Consistency: Nothing happens without it. People who show consistency are sure shot to be rewarded, provided they work smartlyDiscussions and Answer writing: Discussions are very important, they will help in clearing your doubts & better understanding of subject matter. Similarly Answer writing has a very important role, knowledge without ability to express and articulate is futile. It is important to develop the ability to deliver in 8 minutes.Being Optimistic: This is the last but the most important one. UPSC is a time taking process, full of obstacles and failures. How to cope up with them, keeping yourself motivated is the biggest key to success.I will discuss each of the above point in detail sometime later. Also I shall take up discussion on soft aspects like right time to start preparation, should job be left, need of a backup, how do I decide why civil services etc. Clarity on all this is must before giving a full-fledged effort for preparation.Now let us discuss how to prepare for civil services.Pre –Preparation ModeThe initial two-three months are very confusing. People are generally not able to understand what to read, how to make notes, which newspaper to refer and other plethora of questions coming to their minds. What most people end up doing is they join a coaching thinking it to be a solution to all problems , others blindly start following some senior who himself is misdirected. This is a very crucial stage and I feel most of the people lose their momentum here because of a faulty start and they find very difficult to realign later.So starting has to be steady and sober. I think it is important to give at least two months to yourself to get yourself in UPSC mode. Start reading newspapers and noting them down, basic NCERT’s of economics, Polity & other basic ones, some good blogs/book etc. This will not only help in giving you a foundation but also help in taking informed decisions related to preparation (estimation of time you will need, need of coaching, should job be continued, optional choice etc.). This will act as a trial and error time where you can learn how to make notes, how to read books, learn from others etc. So this will make things smooth in your preparation be it self or through coaching.I shall discuss in detail how to go about in pre-preparation modePreparation ModeWhen you start your preparation, have...

what are the noninvasive blood glucose monitoring systems abroad	what are the noninvasive blood glucose monitoring systems in india	0	"As of now , no non invasive blood testing method is avalaibe in market .Research is going on and clinical Approaches that have been tried include:1.near infrared spectroscopy (measuring glucose through the skin using light of slightly longer wavelengths than the visible region).2.transdermal measurement (attempting to pull glucose through the skin using either chemicals, electricity or ultrasound)3.measuring the amount that polarized light is rotated by glucose in the front chamber of the eye (containing the ""aqueous humor"").Only problem these methods are facing are data accuracy and reliability and most imp to make them commercially viable ,these methods are v expensive .I am sure in future as technology increases these things will be more developed and accurate :-)"	25 Amazing Ancient Indian Inventions That Changed The World Today.India has to its credit one of the oldest civilization in the world. There are a lot of significant contributions that India has made to the world in the field of art, science, mathematics and so on. A lot of modern day inventions are based on the principals that were created in India right from the mythological age. Take a look at the amazing ancient Indian inventions that changed the world today.1. The number system was invented in India. Aryabhatta invented Zero.Buttonsimage sources 1, 2Buttons were first used in Mohenjo-daro for ornamental purpose rather than for fastening. They were first used in the Indus Valley Civilization by 2000 BCE.2. Chessimage sources 1, 2Chess developed out of Chaturanga, which is an ancient strategy board game developed during the Gupta Empire in India around the 6th century AD. Now you know why Vishwanathan Anand is such a pro, rag rag me is tarah…3. Prefabricated home and movable structureimage sourceIn 16th century Mughal India, during the reign of Akbar, the first prefabricated & movable structures were invented.4. RulerRulers were first used by the Indus Valley Civilization prior to 1500 BCE. Made of ivory, the rulers found during excavation, reveal the amazing accuracy of decimal subdivisions on it.5. Shampooimage sourceThe word ‘Shampoo’ is derived from chāmpo (चाँपो). It was initially used as a head massage oil for the Nawabs of Bengal during the Mughal Empire around 1762. It evolved into shampoo over the years.6. Snakes and Laddersimage sourceThe game, Snakes & Ladders, was invented in India as a game of morals. Later it spread to England and eventually introduced in the USA by game pioneer Milton Bradley in 1943.7. Cotton cultivation (We clothed the world, yay!)The ancient Greeks used to wear animal skins and were not even aware of cotton. But Indians were sort of cooland started cultivating cotton during the 5th – 4th millennium BCE in the Indus Valley Civilization. The word spread to the Mediterranean and beyond and soon everyone was ordering one from Flipkart. Well, pretty much.8. Fibonacci NumbersThe Fibonacci numbers were first described by Virahanka, Gopala andHemachandra as an outgrowth of earlier writings by Pingala.9. Decimal System, Quadratic formula and Zero!It was in 7th century CE when Brahmagupta found the first general formula for solving quadratic equations. The decimal system (or the Hindu number system), which was a precursor of the Arabic numeric system, was developed in India between the 1st and 6th centuries CE.10. Suits GameThe popular game of cards originated from India & was known as Krida-patram (which literally means “painted rags for playing”).11. Cataract Surgeryimage sourceIndian physician Sushruta (6th century BCE) had the knowledge of performing cataract surgery. It spread to China from India. Greek scientists would visit India to get operations done and also to learn the nitty-gritties.12. Diamond MiningWorldwide, India was the only source of diamonds until the discovery of mines in Brazil in the 18th century. Almost 5000 years ago, diamonds were first recognized and mined in central India.13. Water on Moonimage sourceISRO’s Chandrayaan-1 made the startling discovery that our moon is not a dry ball of rocks. The discovery of lunar water is attributed to the Chandrayaan mission.14. Radio/Wireless communicationimage sourceWe all know that Marconi received a Nobel Prize in Physics in 1909 for contribution to the development of wireless telegraphy. But the first public demonstration of radio waves for communication was made by Sir Jagdish Chandra Bose in 1895, two years prior to Marconi’s similar demonstration in England.Sir Bose was posthumously credited (more than a century later) for his achievement. The fact remains that this discovery truly shaped the face of modern wireless communicatio...

what does the more things change the more they stay the same mean	why do some people believe that life ends at death	0	It means that “while a lot of big changes appear to be happening, the real situation is that nothing important has changed much at all”. It gets used a lot to describe stuff that appears random in the short term, but follows the same pattern in the long term - like rainfall, or stock prices, but this use of the phrase (while valid and common) only captures the original meaning at surface value.In my opinion, to understand this statement you need to understand the origin. It was written (in French) by Jean-Baptiste Alphonse Karr in 1849 (plus ça change, plus c'est la même chose), the year after the French revolution (French Revolution of 1848 - Wikipedia) . As you might have guessed, French society and politics had seen a huge amount of upheaval - and a new president called Napoleon had been elected into office (and would shortly transform the republic into an empire). This probably sounded very familiar to Karr, given that this was the second time in 50 years that someone called Napoleon was forming a French empire just after a French revolution. Karr was a satirical writer, and the irony of two such similar revolutions occurring so close together, both promising to free the peasants forever clearly wasn’t lost on him. He penned the phrase ‘the more things change the more they stay the same’ (in french), to express his cynicism that the huge changes sweeping over France were going to lead to a genuine change in the country.So the phrase originally meant that “the huge changes that you often see happening in politics don’t represent real change, and are covering up the fact that the status quo in society tends to remains unchanged”.A cynical person on either side of politics may well think that the phrase is just as relevant today as it was over 150 years ago.	Why do some people believe that life ends at death?I am a former Baptist raised in a fundamentalist household but I am now an atheist and I fall into that category of “some people” because I believe that death is the end of life.Why?It wasn’t a matter of being an atheist. I know of several atheists who believe in life after death and for a while, I held it as a possibility. But I like to read and before the days of Google and Wikipedia, I would sometimes go to public libraries and graze in their aisles. One day I happened upon a medical book that had an article about a man named Phineas Gage. Gage was born in 1823 and when he was 25 years old he worked in railroad construction. This was in the heydays of John Henry, the Steel Driving Man of song, prior to the advent of steam powered drills. Gage was working on drilling holes in rock, filling them with black powder and then exploding the powder in order to break the rock. The ‘steel driving’ part was a matter of using a sledge to poke a long pointed bar downward through the rock. Once that was done, the powder was poured in and the bar’s flat end was used to tamp down the powder. Gage had reached that point in the process when the bar struck a spark in the hole, effectively creating a cannon with a javelin-shaped projectile. Here’s Wikipedia’s illustration for what happened next:Gage was rushed to his rented room, basically to die.But against long odds, Gage survived and recovered.Before his accident Phineas Gage was considered personable and was generally well-liked. After the accident, as might be expected, today, anyway, Gage displayed changes to his personality. There seems to be some dispute about whether these changes were exaggerated after his death, but the changes were noted by doctors who examined him.Today, damage to a large portion of the brain is much more survivable and the effects are better understood. The brain is where our cognition, our mental functions occur. Who we are is based entirely in the brain. I was taught from an early age that a magical spirit invested people with their personality, their soul, but, like most of the fairytales told under the label of religion, I no longer believe that. I’ve been told by religious believers that the brain isn’t really an organ of memory, abstraction, reason, emotion and every other aspect of human behavior, but that it is really a receiver or receptacle for the directing spirit that is actually the human being. But Gage and all the subsequent patients who have had their brains physically altered put the lie to that idea.There are volumes of data correlating brain function to human behavior and cognition. There is literally no reputable data in support of anything like a soul or spirit. In fact, the fundamental precept of “spirit” and “soul” is that they are supernatural, not capable of being physically measured, tested or perceived in any scientific sense.So, no, the idea of an afterlife is not believable to me. I didn’t exist before I was born; I won’t exist after I die.
how do i start a solar energy business in egypt	how do i start solar energy business	0	To start with, I’d like to know for what purpose and which scale do you intend to start the business in the first place. On top of that, which kind of ‘business’ are you referring to? If what you meant was to sell electricity directly to the end-users, then unfortunately it’s impossible. In order to sell power produced by solar panels, you first need to register as an applicant before being evaluated by PLN, as the power purchaser. Unlike in the past, the procurement process is now conducted through ‘direct selection’ mechanism, and so you would need compete with many other applicants.Procurement process of all renewable plants, including solar power, should be carried out through an intricate, long, and complex procurement process. That being said, you need to liaise with PLN,as the sole provider of electricity. The electricity purchasing process itself is quite complex and require a complicated mechanism. As for solar plant producing power less than 10 MWp, the procurement can be carried out by PLN regional representatives, meanwhile as for solar plant producing power more than 10 MWp, the procurement process must be done by PLN’s headquarter office, DIVEBT to be precise.To make your move possible, you should first follow the pre-qualification process and you’ll be informed whether or not your application passed the PQ process as necessitated and the list of selected providers will be issued consecutively. Remember that the Power Purchase Agreement for solar plants is not more than 25 years after COD, this will be helpful in preparing all your important calculations; IRR, BEP, etc. As far as I’m concerned the bidding process is based on regional quota, for instance, it has been finalized that in Sumatera island alone the total capacity for bidding process will not be more than 168 MWp, all of which distributed in 115 separate locations.Last but not least, you will have to employ people who are highly knowledgeable and experienced in this sector (especially in price negotiation) and also, be aware of our ‘capricious’ regulations. Who knows if this year the procurement process will be changed.Wish you luck.

how do i manage time for studies	how do you manage time between work and study	0	I’d like to recommend Celoxis. It is a powerful and integrated platform for project management and work collaboration. With Celoxis you get real-world project management, intell...	Here are some things you need to do:1)Take regular breaks and do the most important tasks immediately after the breaksInstead of taking too much pressure and stress it is important to take short breaks. Play an instrument, listen to song, talk to friends or go for a nature walk. My personal advice: don’t get into social media or watching TV, they never really refresh you. And once you are back into your best mode after the break, do the most important and high on priority tasks first.2)Learn to say ‘NO’Remember you can not do everything in the world. Politely refuse to accept additional tasks if you think that you’re already overloaded with work. Take a look at your ‘To Do’ list before agreeing to take on extra work.3)Schedule and Prioritize your Work tasks:All the tasks you do throughout the day should be divided and prioritzed into 4 quadrants.People who spend most of their time in Quadrant I usually have stressful lives. What they need to do is both important and urgent. They have to respond to tight deadlines, they need to solve crisis and have to put out fires constantly.People who spend most of their time in Quadrant III usually have a short term focus. They feel out of control every then and now and have a short attention span.The Quadrant IV is all about time wasters or activities that don't provide any value. Anything done abusively could enter this category too (TV, video games, internet surfing...).Quadrant II is THE quadrant where you want to spend more time. It is the quadrant of planning, preparation, balance and pro-activity. It helps you to be highly productive and your best self on important issues and dealing with important issues before these turn into URGENT.4)Focus and block out distractionWhen you work, there has to be only one thing in your mind: Your Work. Remember that everything else is secondary and can wait but the task in hand, won’t. Silent your phone, disconnect the internet and ask people not not to disturb you if need be. Also keep a tab of the time spent on each task.Best Regards!
what is the academic calendar at xlri	is it possible to give usmele step 1 after 8 years of gap	0	On a purely academic basis what is the difference between XLRI and IIM (ABC)? Also, what are the advantages/disadvantages of choosing the IIM ...	Even though your question is vague without supporting details, I will attempt to answer it.Is there a particular reason for pursuing a Masters in Law?In my opinion evaluate the following while deciding on whether to or not to do LLM:Is it absolutely necessary to do masters to get an edge over other coworker and or competitors at work place? Well that completely depends on your place and country of practice. In some countries like UK, you would be better of doing LPC rather than LLM in order to get a decent start to your career.If your practice area is India, then you may not need LLM per se to excel in your career, that is if you are already working and growing in your law firm. Those times are gone when having a LLM from a foreign university would get you a start in a good law firm. Your experience and expertise would much rather do that for you. Having said it's pertinent to note that if you are doing more contentious work ie. practicing in Courts then LLM does not do any additional benefit apart from being another feather in your cap. It may hold some value incase you are working or planning on working in a corporate setup.However if you wish to enhance your knowledge and take a break/sabbatical at the same time from work then go for it. After all college time is always the best time !! Incase you make up your mind about pursuing a Masters degree in Law, choose your subject wisely. Do it in the subject you have already done extensive work and have fair knowledge. It's not recommended to do it in a completely new subject that may interest you. But that's my personal opinion.A Masters degree may be of value to your resume incase you wish to be a teacher in a law college.Hope this helps.
what is your take on urjit patel as the new rbi governor	is urjit patel is right person for rbi governor	1	He is the best candidate among the short listed four and is a continuity candidate.Few thoughts -Patel was the architect of RBI’s new inflation targeting regime and generally considered as hawkish as Rajan. Among the short listed, he was the most consistent supporter of using headline CPI as the nominal anchor. His appointment sends a clear signal that the current monetary policy regime will continue. Some weeks ago, Nomura in a research note[1] had published a “cheat sheet” of monetary policy stances of the candidates from the then much larger short list -Patel has worked at both central and state government levels in several departmental areas ranging from civil aviation, pension, telecom, competition commission, state electricity board and of course RBI. Unlike Rajan who was a career academic with a brief stint in IMF, Patel also spent some time in Indian private sector (Reliance). These experiences can only be an advantage.Much had been made of Rajan’s academic background in Indian media. Patel obviously is not in that league. I am not sure it matters that much. After all Rajan was the first ex-academic central banker India had. There had been many other very effective central bank governors in many countries who were career central bankers. And bear in mind that Rajan is quite an exception. There aren’t many other Indians at that level that the government can hire as RBI governor. Take a look here, - Economist Rankings at IDEAS, Number of Citations the top 5% economics authors by number of citations. Several years out of academia, Rajan is still there. There are only a handful of Indians there and most of them working in completely different areas.Patel will probably be more “RBI governor like”. Unlike Rajan, he will not use the RBI governor post as a bully pulpit to talk about crony capitalism in India, electoral malpractices, corrupt corporate leaders etc etc. He will not be as much fun but this will probably get him an extension after three years. That will be good.It is not clear whether Patel will continue with current RBI policy on clearing up bad debt from state banks’ books. During Rajan’s term RBI was very determined about that and the state banks had started showing quite an attitude change in recovering bad loans, pursuing defaulters etc. I never understood if it was mainly a Rajan project or had broad consensus within RBI.Footnotes[1] Your Raghuram Rajan potential successor cheat sheet	He is the best candidate among the short listed four and is a continuity candidate.Few thoughts -Patel was the architect of RBI’s new inflation targeting regime and generally considered as hawkish as Rajan.

why do you want to be to president	would you want to be president	0	Excellent question! It’s a terrible job. You lose all privacy. Every aspect of your life and your family’s life and your personal history and your family history are exposed to public view. No matter what you do, somewhere close to half the population will hate you. There is no break or rest from the job — presidents who are on “vacation” are not really on vacation, they are just doing their job somewhere a little nicer than Washington, because the job follows them everywhere. No matter what, many lies will be told about you, and many people will believe those lies. The job is enormously stressful, and people who hold it seem to age very quickly.So with all of that, why would anyone want it?There are a lot of reasons. Some people are just wired to desire power, either because they want to use it to do good or solve problems, or because they want personal aggrandizement (and for many people it’s a little of both). If you spend your life in politics, being elected to various lower offices, the Presidency is the highest thing you can aspire to. And I think everyone, or almost everyone, who goes into politics is at least a little narcissistic; you have to believe that YOU are the best choice to lead the country. You basically have to be pretty sure that you are pretty special. So for some people, these things overwhelm the obvious downsides of the job.	Q: Would you want to be president after Trump?A: I wouldn’t want to be president after anyone. But if I had to be president, and could choose who to be president after, Trump would be my choice. He’s been such as disastrous train wreck that anyone who follows will look good in comparison.And the correct paths to follow will be so clearly laid out, basically boiling down to this: fix the damage! (So much damage to fix!)Repair the fractured relationships with key allies. Get the EPA back to doing it’s job - especially concerning greenhouse gases. Restore and strengthen the Affordable Care Act. Populate the executive branch with qualified, honest people who know what the hell they’re doing. Unwind the ridiculous massive tax giveaway to the rich. Try to get a decent Supreme Court judge or two confirmed and installed (should openings arise). Do something about our epidemic of mass shootings - thoughts and prayers ain’t cutting it. Restore honesty and integrity to the executive branch. Stop the scapegoating of Muslims, immigrants, gays and transsexuals. Stop the misogyny. Keep government out of women’s private reproductive decisions. Protect the Dreamers. Forget about military parades and other overt signs of authoritarianism. Stay off the golf course and the boob tube and twitter and get some actual work done.
why india does not have friendly relations with it  neighbouring countries	how are india  relations with  america 	0	How does Narendra Modi visiting so many countries help India? Will signing various deals help us immediately? Is it necessary now, when there are many important issues yet to be solved?	America’s interest in India was evident as early as 1942 when Roosevelt supported India’s independence movement. Though American contact at that time was minimal. Indian Foreign policy characterised by Non-Alignment, refrain from bloc politics, disarmament, anti-colonialism, world peace did not contribute to developing closeness with the USA after independence.Thus, the beginning of the relationship was shaky with series of disagreement on a wide range of issues like India opposed American act of establishing a military basis in Asia and particularly Indian ocean. India had reservations towards the containment policy which brought military aid to Pakistan. However, there were occasions of cooperation also for example- the Suez Canal crisis and the Laos neutralization. Economic relations were progressive where India received American aid. The USA also supported India during the border conflict with China in 1962. The power axis which developed after 1965 between China and Pakistan changed American equation towards India. India, on the other hand, continued to criticise American aggression in Vietnam. The bilateral relation further deteriorated with President Nixon’s rapprochement with PRC, the delays in shipment of Pl-480 and lack of long-term industrial investment in India. After the 1971 war, USA accepted India as a regional power.Economically an exception was made when USA sold ‘XMP 14’ supercomputers to India during Rajiv Gandhi’s tenure. Lets look at what is this history of India-US relations and what might be the possible future of it.All you need to know about India – US relations during 1990’s.After the end of cold war, India and USA had differences on various issues like NPT and CTBT. The Brown Amendment act of 1995 allowed the USA to supply Pakistan with military equipment worth $658 million dollars which included maritime, aircraft and missiles. The situation further complicated when China supplied N-11 missiles to Pakistan and USA did not apply sanctions on China for violating NTCR.The growing military collaboration between Indo-US nations started only after Prime Minister Rao negotiated a long-term collaboration. In 1996, Malabar series of joint naval exercises started in the Indian ocean. A defence policy group was established and India acknowledged American military’s presence in Diego Garcia and the Persian Gulf.Read more – What Is India’s Role In Syrian Civil War?In the 1990s India’s liberalisation policy attracted American business and investment. It was followed by the signing of Indo-US commercial alliance 1995 where the USA declared India as an emerging market. In 2017, Indo-US trade was at 70 billion US dollar.The 1990s also witnessed India’s quest for nuclear supremacy and technology. The Pokhran ll Nuclear test in May 1998 brought the line of cooperation to a halt. It is after President Clinton’s visit to India that certain amount of sanctions were withdrawn and Indo-US vision document was inaugurated.India-US relations during 2001 and onwards:Indo-US relation entered a new phase in the post 9/11 era as military cooperation and strategic partnership started to gain momentum. Both the Vajpayee administration and Bush administration needs to be credited for achieving progress in bilateral relation, particularly in respect of next step in a strategic partnership which was an agreement signed in 2004 on technology and commerce. In 2002, USA strongly criticised Pakistan’s role in sponsoring cross-border terrorism in India. In 2005 George Bush hosted Prime Minister Singh in Washington DC and the 2 leaders announced the successful completion of next step in a strategic partnership. They also negotiated to cooperate in civil nuclear and space matters. Bush reciprocated the visit in 2006. It is in 2006 that India earned bipartisan support in US Congress for the Indo-US civilian nuclear deal.India-US relations during Prime Minister Singh’s tenure:With regard to Barack Obama and Manmohan Singh’s perceptions of bilateral relation, the following issues require special mention-In the initial years of Obama’s Presidency, the focus was upon ‘AF-PAK’ policy which reinstated Pakistan as central to US strategy on counter-terrorism. In 2009, Prime Minister Singh visited USA and 28 areas of dialogues were identified including NSG membership and UN elections. President Obama returned the visit in 2010 where he primarily focused on counter-terrorism, intelligence, economy and education. The bone of contention in the relationship continued to be H–1B visas and the issue of outsourcing.In 2013, USA and India were lots in a dispute over diplomatic immunity and privilege. The incident involved the detention of Department Consulate General Devyani khobragade following a dispute domestic labour. She was arrested by the US State Department on an allegation of visa fraud. This brought the bilateral relation to a standstill until the time the issue was resolved.India-Us relations during Modi’s reign.In 2014, Prime Minister Modi visited the USA which was the result of lifting the de facto travel ban upon him post 2002 Godhra riots. Through the policy of rapprochement American administration gradually softened its position towards Narendra Modi during the election campaign and eventually after his victory. The visit involved multilateral compulsion like General assembly address, diaspora diplomacy and addressing US business community on MAKE IN INDIA policy. Modi invited Obama to be the chief guest on Republic Day in Jan 2015.Read more – What Is The Conflict Between America And North Korea?This visit of Obama to India was the 2nd visit by the same President thus making exceptions in bilateral relation. During the visit hotline was established between the two, the strategic and commercial dialogue was launched, Indo-US defence partnership with the objective to condemn China in South China sea was designed. The 2 leaders met again on the sidelines of UNGA session 2015 and climate change summit in Paris. The defence and technology trade gained momentum by crossing over 14 million US dollar mark.Why improved Indo-US relations has become a priority during Modi’s reign ?Modi has revitalized the Indian economy and that requires boosting investment and manufacturing in India. The US is an important partner in this regard.India wants to develop defence relationship with the US as a way to procure technology that India lacks.Will India-US relations be further strengthened if Modi and trump meets ?Indo-US relationship achieved great heights with President Donald Trump keeping his electoral promise of being the “best friend of India” inside the white house. India was the only country in which the Trump administration came out with a 100-year plan. As Trump announced his South Asia policy giving India a key role in bringing peace in the war-torn nation. For the 1st time, a US President aligned himself with New Delhi’s position that terrorism originates from Pakistan. It is also for the 1st time that US has aligned itself with India’s position on OBOR of China.Read more – Will Wuhan Summit Be A Breakthrough In Indo-China Relations?There are also some issues that the 2 sides need to work on like H-1B visas. The Modi government has taken up the issue with the Trump administration. Similarly, India refused to succumb to any pressure when it comes to the interest of its own people which was to be seen in the rec WTO talks. Another loss of consensus appeared when the USA withdrew itself from Paris Climate Change agreement. Trump’s decision to pull out from trans pacific partnership has worked in favour of India.What might be the future of India-US relations ?In strategic, political, security, defence and economic terms relations between India and US will continue in a positive direction under President Trump. Impact of USA’s relations with Pakistan may or may not affect India. As far as China is concerned it will remain an important factor in the Indo-US relations. The future of India-US relations lies in their capacity to a new quid pro quo.This article was orginally published on electiontamasha.inFollow www.electiontamasha.in for Indian political updates!

how do i stop being addicted to porn	how can i stop watching porn	1	The following answer is an excerpt from Acharya Prashant’s blog “ WORDS INTO SILENCE”Question: How to get rid of addictions like smoking, overeating?Acharya Prashant: Do you overeat when you are sleeping? Do you feel an urge to smoke when you are sleeping? Do you feel an urge to smoke, even when you are deep in relaxation? When do you feel like smoking?Listener: I have been drinking and it started when I was feeling depressed. But later on, drinking became a habit. Then you drink because you are happy, you drink because you are sad, you drink because nothing is happening, out of boredom.AP: Yes, but I still want to go into that.Do you still drink when you are sleeping? Do you drink in your deep moment of contentment? You said, you drink when you are happy, you drink when you are sad. Don’t you see, both of these are moments of excitement? Do you feel like smoking, when you are utterly peaceful? Does that happen?I am not talking of mere absence of activity. I am talking of peace. I am not saying that you are peaceful when there is nothing to do. When there is nothing to do, then you will be bored, not peaceful. And when you will be bored, then you will feel like smoking.Do you feel like smoking when you are peaceful? Do you? Is smoking the problem? Can you quit smoking as long as you continue to be what you are? Restless, peace less, excited, turbulent. But nobody ever comes to me and asks, “How to change life?” People come and ask, “How to quit drinking, how to quit smoking, how to give up on drugs?”Do drugs come, and insert themselves in your mouth? Does the cigarette, unwrap the pack, rise itself and comes to kiss your lips? Or do you go and buy the cigarettes? The cigarette does not buy itself. Who is the buyer of the cigarette, why not talk about him? It’s not smoking that you want to quit, you want to quit that mental state that necessitates smoking. And if that mental state keeps coming, you will continue to smoke. But you will never talk about that mental state because that mental state is related to “I” and our entire lifestyle.There might be people around you who make it compulsory for you to smoke. Not because they urge you to smoke, but because they put you in so much of tension, that you will need to smoke. But you are deriving some benefits from those people, so you will never ask, how to quit those people. Instead you will ask, how to quit smoking? Now, you can never quit smoking as long as you are with those people.It’s quite possible that those that you call as your intimate ones, are the ones that make it important for you to drink. The environment might be in the house, of a nature, that makes you so heavy, that you are forced to drink.L: The other aspect of drinking is that you want a high. And it gives you a high for a short time.AP: Who wants a high?L: Body, Mind. The Mind.AP: The Mind is nothing. The Mind is pair of opposites. The Mind lives in duality. Now tell me, who wants a high?Would you consider the hint? The Mind lives in dualities. The Mind wants only the opposite of where it is. So, who wants a high? The Mind lives in dualities, if the Mind is in one state, it wants to jump to the opposite one. So, if the Mind wants the high, what is the state of the Mind?L: It is low.AP: It’s low. Had you not been feeling low, would you want a high? Why don’t you go into this feeling of lowness? What makes you feel so low that you want a high? And why don’t you correct those factors?L2: Sir, my father used to have a cigarette at Four in the evening, after working so much he would say, “It is enough, let us have a cigarette.” I was watching it for many years and I also started doing that. Exactly at four in the evening after work, I started to say to myself, now it is enough of work, let me reward myself with a cigarette.AP: So, when work gives you a feeling of strain, then you want to celebrate the passing away...

why did british engineering and manufacturing skills decline so dramatically in the 60s 70s and 80s especially when compared with germany 	why did the england have bad living standards in the 70s80s but better now	0	A large portion of Britain's industry had been selling to, and supplied by, the Empire. Locomotives, bridge contracts, ships - major elements of infrastructure orders went on in the Empire's colonies.It was originally thought that the Commonwealth would continue this - i.e. maintain old trade links after independence was given back to the new nations. This completely failed to appreciate the effect of hugely subsidised Soviet trains, road vehicles, and items of essential infrastructure, which ended up becoming the industrial backbone of the new Commonwealth nations like India, Pakistan and much of Africa. Also, the expectation had been that the economies of many of these new nations would do a lot better after independence, than proved to be true in some cases. Britain's had always been something of a command economy, but it had been one underwritten by an imaginary veneer of profitability given to it by the Empire.British industry also tended to rely upon worker pride in the products they made, but large scale consolidation into ever bigger corporations during the Great Depression (that was accelarated in the face of ever declining profitability, after WW2), had meant that this asset - worker pride - was diluted by an ever declining involvement of those workers in the final product.Add to this, a singular failure to innovate in some of the core industries like motor, which led to designs originating from an age of large scale hand-assembly, being forced onto conveyor belt production lines, bored out and geared up to performance levels they had never been designed for - and you saw a rapid decline in reliability. British things were just getting to be a bit rubbish.There are, however, also plenty of examples of British industry pushing production out beyond the state of the art and paying the price for this adventurism. The De Havilland Comet springs to mind, in this regard - providing, as it did, valuable but costly learning, that later competitors would use to their own advantage.	In my personal experience, living standards are much better now than they were when I was a child. In the early 1970s not having central heating was common, even among the middle classes. Now, most houses have central heating or, at worst, storage heaters that work much better than they did in the 1970s, approximating to central heating.Michael Grainger says that the gap between rich and poor has got wider and that may be true but it's also irrelevant to the question. The fact is that everyone has got richer, regardless of whether or not the rich have got richer faster. There are also other contributions to living standards such as the availability and quality of healthcare. The NHS has definitely got better and as it's available to everyone, even the poorest benefit. Likewise, higher education is more widely available. OK, there are now university fees but they aren't up front and in reality they're only a psychological barrier.Then there's technology. There are now only 9000 households with a black & white TV. All the rest have colour. In 1970, colour had only been around for 3 years and most people had black & white TVs. Even the poorest have access to things like PVRs, mobile phones and microwave ovens. Video recorders were just becoming popular around 1980, a surprisingly low number of people had any kind of phone in 1970 (mobiles as we know them started in 1984) and the microwave was something people had seen on Tomorrow's World. Today, outside central London, most households have a car. In 1970, that was definitely not the case.Now to the point of comparison with Germany and France. I'm really not sure what the answer is. It's certainly so that over the past twenty-five years the UK economy has grown a bit faster than the French economy and over the past ten years, also a bit faster than the German economy. However, the effect on living standards is hard to gauge. All three countries are prosperous developed nations and all three have good living standards. I think each excels at something and each has a failing elsewhere. I think that the three countries are comparable but more or less inseparable in terms of living standards. For the most part, I think that was also true when I was a child.
how do i work with machine learning researchers after graduation	how can undergraduate help with machine learning research	0	The simplest way is to apply for a job related to machine learning. Right now, most of the universities are trying to create courses in the Machine Learning field to supply the demand. However, if you read sites about careers, employers still give more value to hands-on experience.	This question is kind of vague, so I’m not 100% sure how to answer it, but I’ll assume you mean what can you do as an undergraduate to become a machine learning researcher.So here’s the breakdown:Coursework:As an undergraduate looking to get into the field of ML, I’d advise that you take as many ML related courses as possible. At my undergraduate university, that meant taking background courses like Linear Algebra and Probability and Statistics and then going onto advanced courses like “Machine Learning”, “Advanced Machine Learning”, “Computational Learning Theory”, “Artificial Intelligence”, “Natural Language Processing, and “Computer Vision”. This will buff you up on the theoretics and background knowledge needed to advance any further.Research Assistant:The research assistant opportunities available obviously depend on your school, but most universities have undergraduates working with professors or graduate students on projects all the time. Do your research on what professors are doing what and see if you can work on something. This will give you a nice glimpse on whether research is for you and maybe even what topic interests you most.In case you’re wondering what being a research assistant encompasses, it depends on your background and the professor/grad student. If a professor thinks you’re competent enough, they might have you do some exciting stuff - but it could also mean being the programming implementor (which has its own set of positives, too). It really depends, but either way, I’d highly recommend you do this!Outside Learning:Take the initiative to learn things on your own (pertaining to machine learning, of course). For me, this meant reading a lot of papers or playing around with some of the built in Python modules. Learning beyond the traditional coursework offered by universities is a great attribute to have, so I highly recommend you do so!Hope this helps!
what is the future for ios developers	as of 2015 what is the future of ios development	0	Creating the user interface for iOS apps used to be very easy in the past. Before the iPhone 5 there were just one phone size and one tablet size. With the introduction of the iPhone 5 there was a little bit more work to do, but the general philosophy did not change. But now you have also the iPhone 8, iPhone X and iPad Pro sizes so that it is not possible to layout absolutely anymore. Apple’s answers to this problem are size classes and auto layout.Generally speaking, these two tools have a lot of power so that it is possible to implement all layout requirements. But on the other side they are very difficult to learn. I believe this is the main reason for introducing Stack Views which are very similar to the Linear Layout in Android development.So I think it is very likely that Apple will introduce a complete new layout system in the future that is both powerful and easy to learn.The iPad Pro will change iOS development dramatically. Not because the development of apps will change as such. But the iPad Pro will make it possible to develop other kinds of apps.Although there are already very powerful apps on the iPad, it was not possible to develop apps that have the power to replace desktop applications like Adobe Photoshop because the screen size is too small. But the iPad Pro has a screen that is big enough for that kind of apps. Also the introduction of the Apple Pencil is a very important step because the user input with your finger tips is to limited for some use cases.The new Apple TV is a very important new device for the platform as well. The Apple TV used to be just a hobby for Apple, but with the introduction of the new Apple TV and the SDK this changed dramatically.It is very obvious how powerful a Apple TV SDK is. First of all, it is very similar to the iOS SDK. The main difference is that it lacks a webview. But besides from that it is very easy to adopt your existing iOS applications to the Apple TV. Also the creation of new apps will be very straightforward.So in my opinion the platform will grow dramatically in the future. Professionals like designers and photographers will prefer the iPad Pro over the laptop and consumers will love the Apple TV. That also means that there will be an even higher demand for iOS developers in the future.For more information About IOS please visit Omnist Techhub Solution	I believe we will have a much faster development cycle, more similar to the web but with the big advantage of not having to support many platforms.Things like Playgrounds and App Thinning are clear references to try to speed up the development and deploy process that was really slow in the past. Also, the fact of open source Swift 2.0 plus the similarities with Rust and Go is a bet to speed the evolution of the language so it can reach the point where Objective-C was after forty years in less time.One missing pice I expect to see in the near future is the ability to change a running program so the write-test-fix process were orders of magnitud faster. I'm thinking in a workflow like Bret Victor - Inventing on Principle describe where things happen right in the moment an idea appear, so you can play with your own ideas with instant feedback.Finally, the software technology is coming to a balance where old ideas and new experiences mix in a sweet spot, ancient things like lambdas (closures) and values types are the trending now so maybe we should look forward with an old lense to see the future.PD: Bret Victor, beast of burden
what is the meaning of life what is our purpose on earth	what do you feel is the purpose of life	1	Well, I am 19, but I still feel I have figured out the answer to this question which I am going to share with you.First of all, speaking in a very discrete fashion, life makes no sense. We all will die one day (god forbid it, maybe this very moment) and would be just like before - nothing. It won’t matter if you lived the life of Elon Musk or some random dude (admitted, Elon has lots of problems of his own, but his life is idolised by the masses unlike yours and mine). So why make an effort for anything?Everyone among us does a variety of jobs/emotions everyday which you can classify as ‘I enjoy it’ (eating, sleeping, partying, watching movies, etc.) and ‘I hate doing it’ (studying for many, working, waking up to go to office, deadlines, accidental pains, loneliness, breakups, etc.).The quality of your life is determined by the sum total of above. Is the total number of things which you love doing more than those you hate? For most people this is not the case. They are too busy making both ends meet and making a secure future for themselves and their progeny. This is what makes them question their life. It is these people who feel life has no purpose mostly.So, were you better off if you weren’t created in the first place? Or you are better spending 80 years in the form of life where you would have to go through all these good and bad feelings and circumstances? This makes me wonder if life has no purpose at all. I mean, you are born, go through an education system for 20+ years (to fit in), and then do a job (and face lots of difficulties and failures in life), do the same with your kids, and eventually die. This makes me wonder if all this was a waste. But then, we get to experience so many good stuff in this journey (success, joy, travelling, knowledge, food, music, nature, etc.)So does life have a purpose?Depends on you. If you want to enjoy this beautiful gift and experience as many things as possible, do it now. Don’t wait for anything. You never know when you will die. You don’t want to regret not asking out that girl/ going for a trek/ learning the guitar/ completing your PhD in your afterlife (if it exists).If you are someone who is facing a lot of drudgery and all sorts of tragedies (true for most people at least in India and similar developing and underdeveloped nations. Believe it or not, poverty leads to lots of problems which leads to questioning the purpose of life.), then better try to find happiness in whatever you have, because a life without good things is worthless and a pain in the @$$. The quality of your life is more about your perception of it than what the society makes you believe. Even a person with no education, money or love can live happily. So why make it so bad? Enjoy it while you have it.The purpose of life - To live it in such a way that you don’t ask yourself this question when you die.

can we weld steel and aluminum together	why can not steel and aluminum be welded together	0	It has always been considered impossible to achieve reliable, continuous welds directly between the two dissimilar metals, especially aluminum and steel.The easiest method is to use the ALUMA-Steel TIG Rod, developed - by welders, for welders -as a solution to a common problem encountered in the industry, a simple cost effective way to weld aluminum to steel.Prior to the advent of the above, welding aluminum to steel was carried out indirectly - but it is a complex process. Special techniques are required as brittle inter-metallic compounds are formed when metals such as steel, copper, magnesium or titanium are directly arc welded to aluminum. To avoid these brittle compounds, special techniques have been developed to isolate the other metal from the molten aluminum during the arc welding process. The two most common methods of facilitating arc welding of aluminum to steel are bimetallic transition inserts and coating the dissimilar material before welding.Bimetallic transition materials are sections of material that are comprised of one part aluminum with another material already bonded to the aluminum. This is done by rolling, explosion welding, friction welding, flash welding or hot pressure welding. These are readily available commercially in combinations of aluminum to such other materials as steel, stainless steel and copper. The arc welding of these steel aluminum transition inserts can be performed by the normal arc welding methods such as Gas metal arc-welding (GMAW) or Gas Tungsten arc-welding (GTAW). One side of the insert is welded steel-to-steel and the other aluminum-to-aluminum.Alternatively, a coating is applied to the steel part of the job, to facilitate its arc welding to aluminum. One method is to coat the steel with aluminum itself. This is sometimes achieved by dip coating (hot dip aluminizing). Once coated, the steel member can be arc welded to the aluminum member, if care is taken to prevent the arc from impinging on the steel. A technique must be used during welding to direct the arc onto the aluminum member and allow the molten aluminum from the weld pool to flow onto the aluminum coated steel.Coating the steel surface with silver solder is also another method. The joint is then welded using aluminum filler alloy, taking care not to burn through the barrier layer of silver solder. Neither of these coating type joint methods are typically depended upon for full mechanical strength and are usually used for sealing purposes only.Recently, a team of engineers at HONDA Japan developed a variation on Friction Stir Welding, in which metals are joined via mechanical pressure – it's the same technique that has been used for experimental steel/aluminum spot welds in the past. As Honda explains it, “This technology generates a new and stable metallic bonding between steel and aluminum by moving a rotating tool on the top of the aluminum which is lapped over the steel with high pressure.” It is claimed that the welds that result are as strong or stronger than those made using regular Metal Inert Gas welding.Another engineer in Austria uses a special solder and torch just hot enough to melt aluminum but not steel. The process, called cold metal transfer, a breakthrough in welding technology, employs an argon gas to avoid oxidation. The steel is coated with zinc to bind the steel, solder and aluminum.There is an interesting video that shoes how aluminum to steel welding is done:Hope that helps!	Stainless steel cooking pans with aluminum heat spreaders on their bottoms have been around for years, 50-60-70 I'm not sure. Cookingware made of stainless steel sandwiching aluminum are welded together through extraordinary high pressure rollers physically squeezing their disparate atoms into a molecular bond. Same premise as explosive welding, but easier, cheaper, and far more friendly on a production line, but limited in the size or thicknesses possible. Explosive welding really has no limit, it can combine aircraft carrier sized thick metal sheets.All-Clad is an example: There is also the friction welding of dissimilar metals, Al and steel included, and the more recent friction stir welding technique.Here is just one of many stir welding examples: Honda develops new technology to weld steel and aluminum togetherI suspect that we will soon see extremely fast pulsed lasers welding dissimilar metals and other materials together. There are now lasers with pulse periods in the trillionths of a second, and materials behave completely differently under these conditions. I am sure some interesting new welding techniques will be a byproduct of these pico and nano pulsed lasers.
which youtube video has the highest likedislike ratio	how is it possible for a youtube video to have more likesdislikes than views	0	This one, which has a ratio of 267.573333333 (the sequence of 3s is infinite, just like 1/3)Things about the video:It is a music video,It was made on May 31, 2012And the rest of all the information,click HERE to see the extension	Forget the other answers. I tested this before starting my Invention Therapy Youtube Channel and know why. If you pay for Youtube likes they run a script that doesn’t even check the total number of views and then the counter freezes and they keep adding likes! That’s how a channel gets more likes than views.The funny part is that views haven’t counted for anything since before 2013!This is all you need to know about views and subscribers.I have this tip and many more on my Invention Therapy Youtube Channel.Tip#1: Only your ego cares about views!Tip #2: Don’t buy subscribers or views from anyone!I have tested this. It will ruin your channel and make it hard to recover from the damage. Buying subscribers does not work with the new Youtube algorithm.Views do not help your channel in any way.Tip#3: Watch time is all Youtube cares about.These people selling subscribers and views are scammers! The accounts will eventually get deleted by Youtube and your subscriber count will go down!!!Youtube doesn’t even care how many subscribers you have at this point. In fact, if you buy subscribers, it will change the dynamics of how viewers watch your channel. Suddenly, Youtube will think your channel is a gaming channel (most of the fake subs are gamers) and suggest your videos to people who are not interested or fake accounts that will eventually get deleted.When these accounts get deleted, your subscriber count will start going in reverse!Like many people have said here on Quora and on Youtube itself, view velocity, watch time and many other factors are all that is important.If you have good content like my Invention Therapy Channel, that just means people will watch your videos. The problem is that you need to drive viewers to your videos to increase watch time and view velocity. Otherwise it will just sit there and die because Youtube will think nobody is interested.Subscribe to Invention Therapy and get more answers like this all the time that will help you grow your Youtube subscriber count. Invention Therapy’s TV Show will help your turn invention ideas into a reality. It is also a great resource for learning how to increase your Youtube views the right way so you have a real channel worthy of the time and effort it takes to succeed now on Youtube.Real subscribers with interest in your topic will help drive view in the beginning and hopefully increase the view velocity over time but a video with no subscribers can achieve the same result.My Fidget Spinner Video is doing just fine and subscribers did nothing to help it.I hope you learned something from my answer.Richard
what is solution to kashmir issue	is it possible for the sharif government to resolve the conflicts in kashmir	0	What is the best political solution to the Kashmir conflict? Should Kashmir be given independence? Is the status quo the best solution?	Not only for Sharif’s government,for any civilian government its impossible to resolve the Kashmir conflict.There are only two stake holders,one is the Indian government and the other one is Pakistani army.If any general of Pakistani army wholeheartedly wants to solve Kashmir conflict its easy,subjected to power and fandom he enjoys in Pakistan.For Indian government accepting LOC as permanent border with minor adjustments at strategic points is not that tough because historically Indian government favored status quo.Geographically its win-win for both the nations because neither of them has to lose territory as LOC is serving as de facto border for quite sometime. But morally Pakisthani army has everything to lose because they justified terror by pointing Kashmir and they lose sympathy in Kashmir.But this would become reality in coming because China is increasingly nervous about Investments in CPEC and its difficult to directly involve in security of the CPEC.China would definitely push Pakistan for this because they want hassle free CPEC corridor .
if you dug a hole through the earth and came out the other side what would happen	if i dug a huge hole in the ground in a straight line what would happen when i reach the opposite side of the earth would my head or my feet come out first	0	If you ignore reality, anything can happen. You could come out the other side as Sponge Bob.Seriously, first you would have to figure out how to pass the center of the earth without being vaporized by the intense heat in the center of the earth. If the hole is wide enough that you can have a perfect free fall, I believe without air resistance you would accelerate indefinitely until you reach the center of the earth, then you would start to slow down and by the time you get to the other side your speed would be close to zero. Now with air there is a problem. You would accelerate in free fall until you reach terminal velocity and your speed doesn't increase anymore. Once you pass the center you will again slow down but your speed wasn't that great to begin with so you reach zero way before you get to the other side. From that point you start free falling back to the original place, but again, air resistance will be such that you will stop closer to the center of the earth every time, like a pendulum that is slowly losing energy with every pass until you stop at the center and live there forever.Of course I'm just speculating….	 This is a beautiful question, in a small part because it’s an interesting thought experiment with some clever math, but mostly because of all the reasons it couldn’t be done and wouldn’t work. Right off the bat; clearly a hole can’t be drilled through the Earth. By the time you’ve gotten no more than 30 miles down (less than 0.4% of the way through) you’ll find your tunnel filling will magma, which tends to gunk up drill bits (also melt everything).Jumping into a hole drilled through the Earth. What’s the worst that could happen?But! Assuming that wasn’t an issue, and you’ve got a tube through the Earth (made of unobtainium or something), you still have to contend with the air in the tube. In addition to air-resistance, which on its own would drag you to a stop near the core, just having air in the tube would be really really fatal. The lower you are, the more air is above you, and the higher the pressure. The highest air pressure we see on the surface of the Earth is a little under 16 psi. But keep in mind that we only have about 100 km of real atmosphere above us, and most of that is pretty thin. If the air in the tube were to increase in pressure and temperature the way the atmosphere does, then you’d only have to drop around 50 km before the pressure in the tube was as high as the bottom of the ocean.Even worse, a big pile of air (like the atmosphere) is hotter at the bottom than at the top (hence all the snow on top of mountains). Temperature varies by about 10°C per km or 30 °F per mile. So, by the time you’ve fallen about 20 miles you’re really on fire a lot. After a few hundred miles (still a long way from the core) you can expect the air to be a ludicrously hot sorta-gas-sorta-fluid, eventually becoming a solid plug.But! Assuming that there’s no air in the tube, you’re still in trouble. If the Earth is rotating, then in short order you’d be ground against the walls of the tunnel, and would either be pulverized or would slow down and slide to rest near the center of the Earth. This is an effect of “coriolis forces” which show up whenever you try to describe things moving around on spinning things (like planets). To describe it accurately requires the use of angular momentum, but you can picture it pretty well in terms of “higher things move faster”. Because the Earth is turning, how fast you’re moving is proportional to your altitude. Normally this isn’t noticeable. For example, the top of a ten story building is moving about 0.001 mph faster than the ground (ever notice that?), so an object nudged off of the roof can expect to land about 1 millimeter off-target. But over large changes in altitude (and falling through the Earth counts) the effect is very noticeable: about halfway to the center of the Earth you’ll find that you’re moving sideways about 1,500 mph faster than the walls of your tube, which is unhealthy.The farther from the center you are, the faster you’re moving.But! Assuming that you’ve got some kind of a super-tube, that the inside of that tube is a vacuum, and that the Earth isn’t turning (and that there’s nothing else to worry about, like building up static electricity or some other unforeseen problem), then you would be free to fall all the way to the far side of the Earth. Once you got there, you would fall right through the Earth again, oscillating back and forth sinusoidally exactly like a bouncing spring or a clock pendulum. It would take you about 42 minutes to make the trip from one side of the Earth to the other.The clever math behind calculating how an object would fall through the Earth: As you fall all of the layers farther from the center than you cancel out, so you always seem to be falling as though you were on the the surface of a shrinking planet.What follows is interesting mostly to physics/engineering majors and to almost no one else.It turns out that spherically symmetric things, which includes things like the Earth, have a cute property: the gravity at any point only depends on the amount of matter below you, and not at all on the amount of matter above you. There are a couple of ways to show this, but since it was done before (with pictures!), take it as read. So, as you fall in all of the layers above you can be ignored (as far as gravity is concerned), and it “feels” as though you’re always falling right next to the surface of a progressively smaller and smaller planet. This, by the way, is just another reason why the exact center of the Earth is in free-fall.The force of gravity is , where M is the big mass, and m is the smaller, falling mass. But, since you only have to consider the mass below you, then if the Earth has a fixed density (it doesn’t, but if it did) then you could say , where ρ is the density. So, as you’re falling .Holy crap! This is the (in)famous spring equation, F = – kx! Physicists get very excited when they see this because it’s one of, like, 3 questions that can be exactly answered (seriously). In this case that answer is , where R is the radius of the Earth, and t is how long you’ve been falling. Cosine, it’s worth pointing out, is sinusoidal.Interesting fun-fact: the time it takes to oscillate back-and-forth through a planet is dependent only on the density of that planet and not on the size!
can we create free energy	how do we make free energy	1	Planting a garden. Yes, you have to work for it but you are using your energy to collect the only free energy known, that of the sun. It is not free if you collect it via a solar panel, you can't store it without using energy from other sources that are not free and even then the storage time and capacity are limited.Some will suggest that wind, tidal and water flow provide free energy. What energy they have is tied back to that same sun and none of it can be harvested for free. Even solar, if it is to be used for anything beyond gardening, will not be free. Solar oven? You have to create the oven and for any effective use, the material required will need other energy for manufacture. The same basic problem lies at the beginning of any energy use effort.Still, planting fruits and vegetables, especially those better eaten raw, is the only “free” energy for you. And it is very good exercise as well.	Planting a garden. Yes, you have to work for it but you are using your energy to collect the only free energy known, that of the sun.

how do i find the phenotypic ratio	what is a phenotype ratio	0	"To determine phenotype ratio, the most likely course of action would be sampling. That is, you take a (hopefully) representative portion of the population you are trying to figure out the phenotypic ratio of, and just count which ones exhibit each allele. With the phenotype ratio, you could use Hardy Weinberg to find the genotypic ratio. This only works if the population is in Hardy Weinberg equilibrium*.Basically,The sum of the dominant and recessive allele ratios must equal 1. (Because that's all of them)A + a = 1Hardy Weinberg says that you can ""square"" both sides to find a relationship for the genotypic ratios. AA + 2 Aa + aa = 1You can plug in your recessive phenotype ratio you obtained from sampling into the equation, and solve.Ex: Say you found that .64 of a population has the dominant trait, while .36 of the population has the recessive trait. aa = .36AA + Aa = .64You sqrt(aa) to find a.a = sqrt(.36) = .6Thus, 60% of the alleles in this group are the recessive. 40% are dominant. Homozygous Dominant = AA = .16Heterozygous = 2Aa = .48Homozygous Recessive = aa = .36*Hardy Weinberg Equilibrium is a set of conditions that have to be met for this method to work. 1. No migration of alleles in or out of the population2. Mating is random3. No net mutation4. No pressure from natural selection(There might be a few conditions I forgot. )"	Genotype and Phenotype are terms that come under the study of genetics. When comparing offsprings of reproduction (i.e: when a new generation is produced by mating) their characteristics can be compared in two ways.1. According to their generic composition2. According to how they look (i.e: according to what changes are observed due to the difference in genetic composition)This (2.) is known as the 'Phenotype' of an organism.All in all, Phenotype is the exhibited genetic character of a gene of an organism. So, a phenotype ratio is the ratio of comparison of these exhibited characteristics.Example:If red colour and white colour are phenotypes of the colour of a flower with genotypes RR and rr respectively, with R representing the dominant allele and r representing the recessive allele, Rr will also be red in colour.(Don't confuse yourself if you aren't familiar with this yet. This is another section of genetics.)Then, the phenotype ratio of the genotypeRR - 1Rr - 2rr - 1will be,Red : White = 3 : 1
why does saturn benefit a house it sits in slowly	why does time seem to pass so slowly when you are in a boring lecture	0	I think everyone knows slow nature of Saturn so the question is more about why Saturn benefits the house where it sits and harms the 3 aspected houses .In Sanskrit , there is a Quote स्‍थान हानि करो जीव:, स्‍थान वृद्धि करो शनि: which means Jupiter harms the house where it sits but helps where it aspects while Saturn helps where it sits and harms where it aspects.The answer lies in the working of the two planets . Jupiter is for growth, grants , donation and benevolence so it ignores its own benefits and focusses outward . It is like budget sanction by top mangement , which everyone likes.Saturn is more for reforms , discipline so it adds value by reforms in implementation .Saturn is like an auditor reaching to an office , taking time to find loopholes , unfair practices , reporting them to top management and forcing reforms in working of that Department , finally increasing efficiency.Though auditor finds errors at one office and reforms it , his recommendations report is sent to all offices , so its aspect also cause reforms.	Thats possible if you are not listening to the lecture for the entire duration. Most of the time, people switch off after a few minutes in a boring talk and they run out of ideas on “what to do”. They are not interested in listening and at the same time they do not have anything else worthy to do.Try solving a numerical problem. Time flies by.It happens that whenever i’m not interested in anything time passes slowly. It is because i am dragging myself to it and there is conflict of interest between the action and the doer.Einstein’s theory of relativity also adds to your solution.

It is time to get up from the ground and touch the sky. There are many actors in Bollywood who are today among the brightest stars of Bollywood on their own. The hard work behind their shine is that they are shining brightly. Today, we are going to talk of an actor who is counted among the richest Bollywood industry.(1). Shahrukh Khan, who is known as the King of Bollywood, during the IPL, his team flies to watch the match of Kolkata Knight Rider, in which he uses his private jet. This is a great actor. His films earn a lot of money. His hard work today appears in his work, name and status. Today we are talking about Bollywood's King Khan is known today as a successful actor after hard work in the Bollywood industry. Regarding the journey from Delhi to Mumbai, you all know that the journey of Bollywood from Delhi in the evening is so confusing that no one is unaware of it. Shahrukh Khan, who started with a small serial on the small screen since 1989, is on Bollywood bigwigs today. Bollywood started her film career in 1992 in the movie Deewana. As you all know, in the early days of Bollywood's journey, Shah Rukh Khan's films were seen in the role of a villain, such as Bajiigar, Later, gradually the image of Shah Rukh Khan came to prominence as a romantic hero and in Bollywood he is known as the romance king. At one time, King Khan, that is, Shah Rukh Khan was considered to be the top of the list of the world's top 5 expensive stars. In films, he went slowly to his famous characters, and Bollywood got a great star, who spread romance all over the world with his performance. Shahrukh has become a brand not only in the bollywood industry but also for the whole world. Today, he is counted among Bollywood's richest actors. As long as we do not become something, we do not even have the power of time.Do you know that for the sake of saving his precious time, SRK has reached the time to complete any of his work on time, that too from his personal plane. Yes, Shahrukh has so much money today that he has bought his own personal plane and now wherever he goes he goes through his plane. Do you know that Shahrukh Khan House earns more than Rs. 270 crore?Apart from acting in films, he has her own production house named Red Chile Entertainment.Apart from this, you must know all his team in the IPL. Yes, Kolkata Knight Riders is a team of Shah Rukh Khan. This can be gauged from the fact that how rich they will be today. On his big screen, his forthcoming film is about to release the same Ziro, which is eagerly waiting for the audience. There is no doubt that a movie of Shahrukh Khan that is not a hit.There are many Bollywood actors who have their own jets. I didn't define much about those persons that if I define then it is quite long. You all are feeling bored. So please forgive me.Edit:- Actually, My writing skills is so poor that I have written this answer as If I did any mistake. Kindly forgive me my humble friends.Thanks my all readers…..
is there a difference in quality between wired and wireless headphones if so why	what are the differences between having bose headphones in the ear and around the ear	0	It depens on what you are doing when listening.1.If you are running not too ong everyday,like under 2 hours, wireless is better.2.If you run up to 2 hours, you might consider wired. cos the battery can not last too long.3.If you want a high quality sound, choose wired.4.If you don`t mind about the sound quality, both of them are OK.	The fundamental differences between in ear-phones and over the ear-phones are:The size of the driver within the housing,The isolation from the outside noise.Generally speaking a well fitted in ear-phone will give a slightly better isolation from the outside world which means less interference from other sounds which allows you to hear your choice of music or spoken word entertainment better. However, an over the ear-phone will give a broader frequency response which translates into lower/warmer lows and higher/crisper highs.The Bose over the ear-phones would tend to offer noise cancellation. A small microphone on the outside of the housing listens to the surrounding noise and with some clever electronics will reverse the phase of the noise will cancel out any outside noise you will hear with your ear giving you a sense of isolation and generally a better music experience.The quieter you can afford to keep your in-ear phones or over the ear-phones the better it is for your ears/hearing, isolation or noise cancellation will facilitate this.The key is to know the purpose of use and this will generally guide you to the product that will perform best for you.
what are some movies that everyone needs to watch at least once in life	what movies would you recommend everyone to watch	1	Bear with me because 10 is a very large number for a list! As a film fanatic, you’d want a variety of movies to watch of different genres incorporating the many different types of techniques to showcase a movie! Without further ado, a list of movies you must watch as a film fanatic:Citizen Kane (1941) : Often hailed as the best movie ever made, this is a movie you MUST watch if you’re a film fanatic. Orson Welles was a pioneer of filming and created many amazing techniques that were revolutionary for his time! A great start on your journey.Psycho (1960): Alfred Hitchcock, along with Welles, is among the pioneers of early filmmaking! This movie was considered a controversy at the time of its release because of it’s unique story line that killed off the main character! Also, the ending caused the American audience to develop a love for thrillers!2001: A Space Odyssey (1968): No list is complete without adding the genius, Stanley Kubrick. I could’ve chosen any of his movies, but I’ve chosen this because of his usage of visual cues. Although made in 1968, it’s amazing visual effects transcend movies released decades later!The Gold Rush (1925): One of the earliest forms of comedy movie, Charlie Chaplin at his finest. Absolute genius of an artist and it’s hilarity still ensues to this day! Not only was he a director, but he was also the actor!‘The Shining’ (1980): One of the greatest horror movies ever created. Not only is it bewilderingly scary, but the plot is riveting, acting amazing, and once again, great usage of technology at the time. Stanley Kubrick is a wonderful director to study!‘The Godfather’ (1972): Another classic movie that is a must-watch! This movie is highly influential in the movie industry. And is often a reference for many gangster related movies! Amazing movie to watch and heart thumping with each death!‘Do the Right Thing’ (1989): One of the best Spike Lee films, it’s a movie that delves into race. Very important topic to watch because all cultures offer different aspects to movie-making! Thought this was one of the best movies made by Lee before he went too artistic!‘Saving Private Ryan’ (1998): One of the greatest war movies, it’s action-packed and filled with many emotional journeys. This is one of the best action movies ever created and you will be at the edge of your seat as you watch this movie! Also, the acting and the cinematography is amazing in this movie. Truly fits the atmosphere of war.‘Lion King’ (1994): One of the best, if not, the best, animated movie ever made, this is one for all ages. You can learn so much from this film, especially music and its importance. One of the most recognized soundtracks and has amazing artwork for the landscape. Story line is one of the easiest to follow and fall in love with.‘Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind’ (2004): One word: screenplay. Has the most amazing lines in any movies. Due to Charlie Kaufman being its screenplay writer, this movie’s lines can easily make you cry!I’m sure there are plenty more, but I personally believe a these movies are the cornerstones of any film-watchers!

can world war 3 ever take place	is world war 3 more imminent than expected	1	Here is the state of the world now (only highlights).North Korea- Has missiles and Nukes in its stockpile. Their missiles do not have enough range to reach continental US. Even if they somehow manage to strike a few Nukes at the US, it will only affect the impact zones immediately. So it will result in the total wipe out of NK in the US’s retaliation. North does not want to nuke the south coz their first goal is to take over the south and unite the Koreas. It does not want to attack any of its neighbors simply because there are no compelling reasons to do so for North. So there’s no real threat.Russia- She has a lot of technologically advanced weapons. Some even better than the US. She has a stock pile of Nukes and intercontinental ballistic missiles. But they have one thing working against them. Their own economy. Their economy is weak. They cannot keep the supplies alive to support an all out war or an invasion. No place can be dominated or occupied without boots on the ground. So there’s no real threat.China- She has the largest army. Lot of hardware, strong economy, many missiles and long history as well. What is working against them is their size and their political leadership. Most of the weapons in their arsenal are old and reverse engineered stuff from the Soviet era. They are modernizing however, but not at the rates they want. Also their navy and air force does not have enough hardware to back an invasion. So no real threat.India- Certainly a large number of people, large army. Relatively modern Air force and Navy. India is historically peaceful and non-aggressive they have stood their ground against aggressors but never pushed back. Also the air force does not have the infrastructure to support an invasion. Navy has inadequate number of modern vessels. Submarine fleet is aging. Modernization is happening at a snail’s pace. Political leadership is not helping with the process either. So no real threat.Europe- Collectively, very powerful and has strategic advantage over the rest of the world due to sheer strength and size of hardware of individual members and the collective strategic knowledge and experience. However, Europe is not as united as they wish to be. Member nations have trust issues with each other due to leftover emotions from previous two world wars. Also there is an impending financial crisis and a social crisis due to the refugee movement. So no real threat.Africa-Individual nations(some of them) may be strong enough to defend own territories against invaders, however none of the African nations are strong enough to launch a war or an invasion against even their Asian neighbors; let alone European or American. Also, most of the continent is torn apart by countless civil wars, racial and tribal conflicts and regional disputes. There is not enough reasons for an outward spill-over of the conflicts. So no real threat.South America- Same as Africa. Third world countries, slow or crippled economies, poverty, smaller, largely inadequate military forces. There are no compelling reasons for them to cause a large scale conflict, let alone global. So no real threat.Middle East- There are a few who can put up a real tough fight against an invading foreign military.Their situational awareness, familiarity with terrain and guerrilla tactics are all advantageous but only works withing the region so they are only good at defense. Certain countries possess good hardware and moderately large modern armed forces. However, none of the Middle Eastern countries possess the military strength to lead an invasion on foreign land or sustain the defense of their own territories for a long time (including Iran). Also they are not synonymous with the modern equipment that they possess. This is because of lack of experience in large scale multi-face, multi-theater warfare and lack of trust between troops. This seriously undermines the collective efforts. So no real threat.Last but not least,USA- Uncle Sam checks off all items on the list when it comes to size, numbers and weaponry. Certainly strong, economy wise. Has a global reach and has lead countless invasions, successfully. They are already the dominating force and has a firm hand of control over the world with many military bases in strategic locations across the entire planet. She is ruling the world now, at least by a big margin (Economically, politically and strategically). So she wouldn’t do anything that would start a third world war and cause a global meltdown. Because once the world goes in to the chaos of war, the balance of power might tip against them. Off course she will get involved in many other small scale conflicts, trying to bring down a dictatorship or install a new one, home-delivering freedom and democracy to the needful. Still, no real threat.Unless something dramatic plays out anytime soon or some nut job decides to let some nukes loose willy-nilly, we are certainly not heading towards a third world war. So just relax and have a cold beer.	Here is the state of the world now (only highlights).North Korea- Has missiles and Nukes in its stockpile. Their missiles do not have enough range to reach continental US. Even if they somehow manage to strike a few Nukes at the US, it will only affect the impact zones immediately. So it will result in the total wipe out of NK in the US’s retaliation. North does not want to nuke the south coz their first goal is to take over the south and unite the Koreas. It does not want to attack any of its neighbors simply because there are no compelling reasons to do so for North. So there’s no real threat.Russia- She has a lot of technologically advanced weapons. Some even better than the US. She has a stock pile of Nukes and intercontinental ballistic missiles. But they have one thing working against them. Their own economy. Their economy is weak. They cannot keep the supplies alive to support an all out war or an invasion. No place can be dominated or occupied without boots on the ground. So there’s no real threat.China- She has the largest army. Lot of hardware, strong economy, many missiles and long history as well. What is working against them is their size and their political leadership. Most of the weapons in their arsenal are old and reverse engineered stuff from the Soviet era. They are modernizing however, but not at the rates they want. Also their navy and air force does not have enough hardware to back an invasion. So no real threat.India- Certainly a large number of people, large army. Relatively modern Air force and Navy. India is historically peaceful and non-aggressive they have stood their ground against aggressors but never pushed back. Also the air force does not have the infrastructure to support an invasion. Navy has inadequate number of modern vessels. Submarine fleet is aging. Modernization is happening at a snail’s pace. Political leadership is not helping with the process either. So no real threat.Europe- Collectively, very powerful and has strategic advantage over the rest of the world due to sheer strength and size of hardware of individual members and the collective strategic knowledge and experience. However, Europe is not as united as they wish to be. Member nations have trust issues with each other due to leftover emotions from previous two world wars. Also there is an impending financial crisis and a social crisis due to the refugee movement. So no real threat.Africa-Individual nations(some of them) may be strong enough to defend own territories against invaders, however none of the African nations are strong enough to launch a war or an invasion against even their Asian neighbors; let alone European or American. Also, most of the continent is torn apart by countless civil wars, racial and tribal conflicts and regional disputes. There is not enough reasons for an outward spill-over of the conflicts. So no real threat.South America- Same as Africa. Third world countries, slow or crippled economies, poverty, smaller, largely inadequate military forces. There are no compelling reasons for them to cause a large scale conflict, let alone global. So no real threat.Middle East- There are a few who can put up a real tough fight against an invading foreign military.Their situational awareness, familiarity with terrain and guerrilla tactics are all advantageous but only works withing the region so they are only good at defense. Certain countries possess good hardware and moderately large modern armed forces. However, none of the Middle Eastern countries possess the military strength to lead an invasion on foreign land or sustain the defense of their own territories for a long time (including Iran). Also they are not synonymous with the modern equipment that they possess. This is because of lack of experience in large scale multi-face, multi-theater warfare and lack of trust between troops. This seriously undermines the collective efforts. So no real threat.Last but not least,USA- Uncle Sam checks off all items on the list when it comes to size, numbers and weaponry. Certainly strong, economy wise. Has a global reach and has lead countless invasions, successfully. They are already the dominating force and has a firm hand of control over the world with many military bases in strategic locations across the entire planet. She is ruling the world now, at least by a big margin (Economically, politically and strategically). So she wouldn’t do anything that would start a third world war and cause a global meltdown. Because once the world goes in to the chaos of war, the balance of power might tip against them. Off course she will get involved in many other small scale conflicts, trying to bring down a dictatorship or install a new one, home-delivering freedom and democracy to the needful. Still, no real threat.Unless something dramatic plays out anytime soon or some nut job decides to let some nukes loose willy-nilly, we are certainly not heading towards a third world war. So just relax and have a cold beer.
how can eating prunes help during a constipation	does eating prunes help with constipation	1	Replace your bag of potato chips or your other oily snacks with some prunes and other dried fruits and seeds. This is a great way to lose weight.Prunes will aid in weight loss if you consider their nutrition and think about how many carbs, etc. you’re consuming and how much you actually need. Here’s the basic 411 on the nutrition of prunes:They contain 74% of your daily requirement (for an average person) for Vitamin K and 16% for Vitamin A.They contain 21% of your daily requirement for PotassiumThey contain 28% of your daily requirement for Dietary FiberThey also contain plenty of sugars.So, be aware of the nutrition before you eat and remember to eat as per your requirement. If you’re considering weight-loss, you must remember to buy the variety with more fiber - Raw Essentials Premium Pitted Prunes, 500g	I’ve edited my answer from another, similar, question to provide you with my professional advice:Constipation in the western world is common because we eat lousy food. The western diet is lacking in fiber and nutrients and loaded with heavily processed ingredients and empty calories. In addition, many medications have constipation as a side effect. Lack of exercise will slow your body’s natural ability to move things alomg. There are certainly other causes, like IBS and microscopic colitis, but in the absence of other etiology, diet and/or medications are the likely culprit.Treating the condition is usually uncomplicated but maintaining bowel health can be a fine line between “just right” and explosive, unpredictable, and potentially embarrassing diarrhea. First things first: look at your diet and see if you’re taking in enough fiber. Plant-based, minimally processed foods like veggies, fruits, whole-grain bread, and beans are good sources of fiber. Drink plenty of fluids, preferably water. Caffeine can cause constipation. Artificial sweeteners just aren’t healthy. Too much sugar isn’t healthy either.If your diet is the problem then you should change your eating habits. Also look at whether you are chewing your food well enough. Gulping down mouthfuls of poorly chewed food means your gut needs to work harder to break it down. Another western-world phenomenon—-eating on the run.For immediate relief you can try a dose of bisacodyl, which is an OTC treatment for constipation. It’s available as a rectal suppository, or as an enema, which both work pretty quickly. The drug is available in tablet form, but it doesn’t work as quickly. Milk of Magnesia is effective overnight, usually. Caveat: you can become dependent on laxatives, so use them judiciously.I work with old folks who frequently have constipation, so we work hard to prevent it. One of the best bowel-maintenance products out there is Miralax. Take it every day and you should be good. Senna is effective for some people but it can cause diarrhea; conversely, without enough fluids, it can cause constipation. Docusate is another OTC that helps as it “softens” stool. Eating stewed prunes or drinking prune juice is effective.If you have no relief, you need to see a doctor.Some people will have a movement every 3–4 days; that’s their norm. Don’t obsess over a daily BM if that’s not your norm. (Bowel-obsessed patients are the bane of all nurses—-demanding a laxative then complaining about diarrhea!) If you don’t eat, you don’t poop—another fact I find myself explaining over & over.I hope this helps.Nurses: We Know Poop1 View
what would be today nonascii s technology had we never realized the value of binary numbers and harnessed it to produce digital technology	would the world be less technologically advanced if the two world wars had never occurred	0	Considering the amount of data being generated everyday by a Web2.0 site and its value in today's scenario, do you think that machine learning should be at the core of the technology of any product? If so, what architecture would you recommend in these type of cases?	Yes. A lot of people would answer otherwise according to their misguided belief that war destroys. That may be true but it also creates as well. During WW2, technological advances in weaponry and manufacturing were only possible due to the desperate total war scenario provided by the situation. The Russians perfected the art of the mass mobilization because of the do or die scenario presented by the advance of the Werhmacht. The world wouldn't have acquired the idea and model of the assault rifle as early as we did had the need to clear houses with the efficiency of a submarine gun, but with the power of a bolt action rifle been a necessity of the conquests of the Third Reich. Tanks wouldn't look the same and wouldn't be NEARLY as advanced as they are today had Hitler just settled for Danzig and nothing more. Slanted armor is a predictable innovation and would have most likely been implemented in the same time frame, however the innovations of much larger AT guns being mounted on top of tank chassis would not have been useful for at least another 2 decades. I believe that thou infrastructure and land development was set back 20 years in Europe. Technological innovation was jolted forward 20. Whether we as a race come out of that better or not is left entirely to the reader. We won some and we lost some. I'm not here to tell you how to think or feel but rather to give you information so you can form your own opinion. Would you trade those 60 million people for what we gained as a race consequently? Those are the truly useful questions.
what is the best way to invest in oil and natural gas	what is the minimum investment if i want to buy oil and gas royalties	0	The safest way is to buy the shares of large, well financed exploration and development companies. These are companies with very high quality properties and excellent balance sheets. These are the companies that are, right now, buying more poorly financed companies for pennies on the dollar. I own shares in both Canadian Natural Explorations (CNQ-T) and Long Run Explorations (LRE-T). These shares were purchased a year or more ago. Guess which investment I'm happier with. Guess which one I just bought more of. Guess which one I wish I had sold much earlier.This oil price crush may get worse before it gets better, but it won't last forever. You want to own the shares of the survivors.Or you could just buy an index fund or ETF.	The minimum investment may vary,and our consultants can help you determine what is best for your portfolio,however, royalty investing is for accredited investors only. To meet thecriteria as an accredited investor, you will have made at least $200,000 ormore each of the last two years, or $300,000 or more combined income with yourspouse, or you have $1,000,000 in liquid net assets, not including the equityin your primary residence.
is arnab goswami probjp	are quorans supportive of modi	0	"Arnab Goswami is Pro-INDIA.He is a person, who wanted to quit journalism, at one instance in his life when he just started his career because he was fed up of Lutyens Delhi, he hated the system of mutual cooperation, sycophancy and corruption in media. It made him feel so sad that he regretted ever being a journalist. So this disruption is born out of the human necessity to change things.He never supported submissive journalism, that other media houses always did. We have always seen journalism as a whole idea of being neutral, this neutrality is a sham. It is not only meant to provide the information but to create the positive impact that is needed in our society. It was detached to people's day to day issues, that we face. He is the one who started to create impact, to ask the questions about the previously ignored issues which no other journalist dared to do.People who accuse him of being pro-BJP should remember the fact, when he broke the Lalit Mode Scam, within 15 minutes of the story Sushma Swaraj had to admit that she helped Lalit Modi. Then he discussed corruption made by Vasundhara Raje in Rajasthan for 15 days in a row in primetime. Then came Vyapam Scam and a series of debates were held over this. In summers of 2016, when there was the drought in Maharashtra, he took the issue and criticised BJP govt. for the ignorance and insufficient measures to fight this huge problem and as a result both central and state govt came into action.In 2011, Manmohan Singh, the then Prime Minister, called for a press conference, (Yes! you read it correctly :P , he decided to speak once), all the editors who were invited were asking really irrelevant and unimportant questions like their message to Sachin Tendulkar (who scored a century last evening), no one dared to ask questions about Coal Gate, 2G Spectrum Scam, Augusta Westland Deal, CWG Scam, Adarsh Scam, Aircel-Maxis case which all were the burning issues at that time, he was the one who asked the question about infamous Devas-ISRO Deal, which was a big scam happened right under the nose of Mr Prime Minister, for which PM answered ""Compromises needed in coalitions"". For this question, he was stopped by some bouncer over there, to behave with Prime Minister.Media is not a Wikipedia, and the idea to remain neutral is rubbish in itself. Neutrality is never going to create an impact, and journalism is an exercise that is absolute futility in the absence of impact. When there are facts right before you, when you can see the White and Black, so why to sit in the middle, to be neutral? Who can be neutral on Yakub Memon knowing the fact of his involvement in the killing of 257 people in 1993 attacks in Mumbai, It takes a backseat of the argument of human rights of Yakub Memon. So as in the JNU row, what is the point to remain neutral when you know the difference between dissent and nationalism?He is a JOURNALIST, not a part of dirty vote bank politics, who can't take a firm stand with the fear of losing the vote bank. I am happy that he is not a weak and hypocrite media person, and he quit to form a new media house ""Republic"", that will not have the stake of any politician and will become the voice of the nation."	It not only Quora, but all social media is full of Modi supporters. Its not that he has started now; he has started in 2004 and flourishing it very well over the years. There are many reasons for this -PR TeamOn December 14,2009, public relations giant APCO Worldwide (Communication company) was hired to promote Modi’s investment and development showpiece Vibrant Gujarat. APCO is also a lobbyist. (The Modi Machine: Makeover gurus)Prashant Kishor devised the strategy to project Modi as the face of good governance in the 2012 Gujarat polls and in 2014 general elections with resounding success.Marketing effortsSoho Square; Ogilvy & Mather - these are two marketing companies who designed each and every slogan, pictures etc. (Soho Square launches book on BJP's election campaign)Online young generationIndia’s population median is 26 years and it means half of the population is less than 26 years; all these youngsters are online all the time on social media. Which do sharing, commenting, liking to boost in front of friend-zone.BJP IT cellI have came across this thread from Reddit and check out for amazing comments. (https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/1uyjoz/quora_politics_of_india_are_the_volunteers_of_bjp)Paid writers are every where; even on quora. A Quora User Pushpak Chakraborty started a hoax (Viral on Quora: Writer defends post that claimed PM Modi called IAS officer).Blind followersQuora, FB, Twitter, Instagram etc. all social media (except Reddit) are follower biased. More the followers more the probability to display random questions on your screen and you believe them due to high number of viewership or up-votes. That is utterly wrong approach.Number of Followers, Viewership of answers, Downvote, Upvote, reporting -This is biased approach on quora which lead to develop only allies clan.Reasons -The human brain is very complex and it can lead us to believe what we want to believe, no matter how weird it may sound to others.Rationality / objectivity is just not possible. Instead we all form a network around us of people who are just like us. It is comforting and helps us avoid conflict.Our minds form a picture of the world in the formative stages (evolving from the fight or flight instinct that is coded in us) and most of us continuously seek positive reinforcement of our beliefs.(Sources - Quora for number of followers)

is it possible to turn off indicator light on a dahua camera	what happens when you fly into a country but they refuse you entry	0	Yes, but it requires you to open the camera cover, find the circuit board. Then you can cut off / unplug the wire/metal piece connected to the LED indicator. It will off.	It depends on why you were denied entry. If it's because you don't have proper documentation (passport and visa, etc), then the airline is liable for allowing you to fly without the proper papers, and therefore they have to cover all fines and costs to return you home.However, if you have proper documentation but are denied for another reason (like a criminal record), the airline is still liable to get you home (or to somewhere else), but will try to get the money from you somehow. For example, they may use your existing return ticket towards your new ticket, or ask you to pay any difference, or use any legal means to get the money for the fines from you later. It would be up to the airline if they want to bother.

what is the reason pakistan supports terrorism	has pakistan become a safe haven for global terrorism	1	I'm not an Indian but still I'll like to share some points by which Indians must be ashamed of.Kind-hearted Indians-On Feb 14, Pakistan based terrorist group J-E-M killed 44 Indian soldiers and the brutality was so high that not even a single soldier was in one piece. After next day another blast, A major got matryed and by this time every Indian was like “Go to war with Pakistan” “Drop nukes,we don't care if we die” “Give us guns and we'll fuck Pakistan” , everyone wanted war and carried out rallies but after two weeks India carried out a strike in Pakistan killing almost 300 terrorist (claimed by India) and Pakistani airspace in return tried to violate Indian airspace but failed and during this mission one of the IAF pilot crashed landed in POK and got arrested! Every Indian was demanding for his release and finally he was released, as soon as he was released everyone was like “Imran khan is my lord” “Thank you Pakistan” “Say no to war” and literally everyone was thanking Pakistan and none realised the fact that it wasn't that Pakistan wanted peace but they had to release him under conventions and Pakistan was also facing International pressure so they had to. Also that day when IAF pilot was released two Indian soldiers and two cops were killed in cease fire by Pakistan military but no one cared about it as everyone was busy thanking Pakistan thinking that Pakistan literally wants “Peace” and everyone now wants peace, they forgot about Pulwama when none of the soldier was sent home in a “single piece”. So kind hearted Indians are. They didn't get it that Pakistan had to release him as there was no fuckin other chances , many people also said that the “revenge is taken” maybe it's taken but remember they lost Terrorists and no one cares about them but you lost soldiers.2: Indians believe in their government very much-After the surgical strike many Indians were like “where's the proof?” “ was it real?” “How they counted bodies?”Bruh the body count was an estimation as the area which was selected for strike prolly had large number of militants. No one even knows how many soldiers died in pulwama, some sources say 44 and some 40 some 50.3: Indians blames other's easily:When IAF pilot was captured he was asked where he's exactly from in India and he denied to answer but Indian Media was like “we are outside pilot's house and all stuff they revealed about him” but nowadays mostly people don't watch news, they simply depends on Twitter or Instagram or Facebook and get to know current news from social media pages, when Media revealed IAF pilots identity no one even knew but after that Indian memers made memes likeAnd these memes kept on circulating and got viral, everyone got to know about him. Admit it you also got to know about it from such memes only,right? And people were just blaming media while they played more role in revealing his identity.Edit 1:People are commenting that the 1st point is wrong, no one thanked Pakistan, ok so here's proof:Credit goes to Nitin Singh for the screenshotEdit 2:I got that tweet translated from my Indian friend→ Any hate or abusive comment will be deletedCheck it out:WWE- Narendra Modi vs Imran Khan {Must watch}	What I am not able to understand is who is not a hypocrite?WE ALL ARE HYPOCRITE ONE WAY OR THE OTHER.Anyways going back to the pointDance is haramI have never been to a Muslim wedding in my life but what I have heard is that Pakistanis invite transgenders to dance in the wedding. I guess its a tradition they carried from India.Uneducated womenI am not saying most Pakistani women are uneducated but its very common. Girls from affluent families make it to a lavish life but in the little towns, villages and remote areas its a struggle.A must watch movie, Dukhtar that one must see the struggle of a mother. Even though Islam says a woman must get as much education she wants.Muslim brotherhood shamAs much as the whole of Pakistan claims that they are muslims casteism, regionalism runs very very strong in them. They are even more divided than us Hindus actually.Thats when Muslims tell me I follow casteism I tell them how come you claim you dont.Till humanity exists there will always be discrimination.Double standardsWhen their girls are in Pakistan this is how they liveBut when the same girls go abroadThey live like this. I dont understand who is a real muslim then?While guys like to live like this. They love to be hip but women must be covered back home and I have seen educated men with women dressed like Halloween.SecularismThe picture tells the story: Don’t worry the truly secular nation Canada is giving her an asylum.Double facedThey talk about liberation of Kashmir but actually want it to become a part of it. I respect more if one is more honest with me and say like a man “ yeah we want to occupy Kashmir”.We like IndiaHow does it matter? Politics matters. It always has and will. Politicians dont fall off from space they are people within.PovertyIf really Pakistani muslims were paying Zakat and helping poor I am sure it would have ranked the highest in the world.SurnamesYou have converted, forcefully with will its none of my business. Yet they use hindu surnames its ok but then they will talk how that very religion which gave this surname is a shirk. Make up your mind who you are.These points I think are hypocrisy in my mind.Thanks.EDIT #1 If anybody has any issues please let me know in comments with which point they disagree. Dont just post abuses and vague points. I dont. I always talk to the point.

in your opinion what is the best classical song of all time	what  the best classical music piece of all time	1	I think the word “best” is too loaded a term, but if I were to answer, what single work of music is perhaps the greatest cultural product of a single mind? Then I would have to answer, no contest, Beethoven's Symphony No. 9 in D Minor, known also as the Choral Symphony.Sure, it's very popularity can be a negative, as it seems almost cliché to cite this work, but nothing else, in my estimation, achieves what Beethoven manages to achieve here: through sheer force of will (or maybe he was just paying attention), he manages to claw his way up to catch a glimpse of Heaven, then shares with us what he saw.Some might disagree with me, citing Beethoven's mighty Fifth Symphony, an astounding work of unsurpassed originality. But the Fifth only really achieves greatness in its first movement; while the third is delicious, and the fourth a compelling and triumphant ending to the work, they are not at the same level (and the second movement… never been a huge fan).In the 9th Symphony, we are treated to four remarkable movements, united by an overarching story line about the evolution of humanity. Which is why, in the fourth movement, Beethoven recalls the themes of each of the preceding three movements, only to have the basses, the voice of God, reject each as inadequate to the task. Instead, the Ode to Joy theme is introduced, first by the basses, then with the other lower strings (and the loveliest bassoon counterpoint ever written), then the full strings, then the full orchestra, with timpanis pounding and French horns blaring (the sure sign that Beethoven is happy)—to my mind and my ear, the most emotionally moving development of a musical idea you're ever going to find, triumph written large.Beethoven then introduces a human voice—the first for a symphony—which leads ultimately to the full chorus, which is followed by a Turkish-inspired march and a thrilling passage of musical development, leading to the coda and the full-throated singing of the Ode to Joy theme.And then something remarkable happens. Beethoven breaks with the classical structure that, however stretched, still gave form to this work, and enters into some of the most emotionally moving music ever composed, a plea to all of us to question what we know and seek our Creator beyond the canopy of stars. Though other composers had begun writing in the form we know today as Romantic, the abrupt shift in the music here is the visible, visceral break, the end of the Classical, and the emergence of the Romantic.There's more to it, of course, but in the end there is no musical ride that compares with this one. Sure, works written in the two centuries since have built on and far exceeded many aspects of what Beethoven composed, but these works stand on the shoulders of giants, and in particular a grumpy, grouchy, deaf guy who achieved the near impossible. It is for this reason that I say that classical composers may be properly understood to fall into two groups: Beethoven, and everyone else.

what are some unusual aspects about politics and government in hungary	what are some unusual aspects about politics and government in singapore	0	"Hungary is a durable country.For generations Magyarorszag served as a barrier between Asian steppe and the civilized Europe. In 1241 it was devastated by the Tatar onslaught. However, due to the prudent policy of King Bela IV country rebuilt its ruined castles and introduced armored cavalry which could resist penetrating force of Mongols' arrows. As a result, when, starting in 1285, next waves of Mongols-Tatars had invaded Hungarian flat lands they were successfully repelled this time.In XVI-XVII centuries Hungary was again on a front line in the conflict between the East and the West. Turks conquered Buda in 1541 and divided the country into three parts. Nevertheless, in 1718 Hungary was again free from Ottoman rule ending a long liberation journey which started in 1686 by Holy League's army (an alliance organized by Pope Innocent XI to oppose Turks) reconquering Buda.In XXth century Hungary took the wrong side of both World Wars. As a part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire it got defeated by Entente forces but not militarily. Romanian attack into Transylvania and Russian (Brusilov) Offensive came largely in fault and the Empire ended the war by Karl Franz Joseph Ludwig Hubert Georg Otto Marie (Charles IV) signing Padua armistice on November 1918 after uprising in the army and factories' strikes made it futile to resist. Years of revolutions, civil wars, economic hardships and Hungarian national uprising followed. As a result, populist figures such as Ferenc Szalasi rose to power. Not learning its historical lesson, Hungary entered the Second World War on the side of the Third Reich on 26 June 1941.After the defeat of the Nazis, Hungary was invaded by the Red Army and later subdued to Stalinist government sponsored by the Soviet Union. However, Hungarian people didn't like the totalitarian regime too much, and, on October 1956, most of the country revolted against Moscow appointed rulers. After some deliberation, Nikita Khrushchev (USSR leader) had sent 150,000 soldiers and 2,500 tanks to crush the uprising and later installed in Hungary Moscow appointed Janos Kadar to lead the new government. However, Hungary could not longer be ruled by red dictators. Magyar Szocialista Munkáspárt, MSzMP introduced a number of free-market reforms in 1968 (named the New Economic Mechanism) which converted Hungary to the most prosperous country in the socialist Warsaw Block. Ironically, Hungary was then called ""the happiest barrack"" in the Socialists camp.After Soviet Union collapsed the capitalist economy came into full force in Hungary as it did in other former Pact's states. As in other East European countries the level of living for majority of population dropped sharply after that. It led to the Magyar Szocialista Párt - MSZP rise to power. Socialist party dominated Hungarian political scene until 2010 when Viktor Orban's nationalists Fidesz – Magyar Polgári Szövetség got 114 seats (more than two-third) in the Országgyűlés (199-members Parliament). The largest opposition party - MSZP - has now 29 seats in it.Hungary has a well diversified economy with such industries as food processing, electrical goods, motor vehicles, pharmaceuticals and tourism leading in its GDP structure. GDP growth rate is currently under 1%. However, unemployment rate dropped from 11% in 2008 to 6% in 2016.Hungary became a member of the European Union in 2004 and today it attracts criticism from other EU members for its non democratic style of governments. It's stated that Orban has sacrificed basic civic freedoms (that of speech and popular protests) to achieve political stability and to improve economical indicators of the country.There are now different projections concerning the political future of Hungary but we can be certain that this country which profession is to survive will endure through that historical phase as well as it did through all previous ones"	"Singapore means Lion City. You can or not believe whether there have ever been lions leaving on one of 63 Singapore's islands. You might also argue whether or not there is a true democratic system present in the Republik Singapura. What is not arguable, however, is the fact that Singapore's people have built, literally from scratch, one of the most exciting and successful Country in the World.The Garden City's modern history is not only exiting but paradoxical as well. Firstly, Singapore obtained its independence (9 August 1965) not as a result of revolutionary war, a military coup or, at best, as a gift from a dissolute foreign power (as it had been the case with all other former colonies elsewhere), but as the punishment. Secondly, Singapore has possessed none mineral resources whatsoever. Thirdly, Singapore didn't have an unifying ideology, religion or a sense of national identity to lay into the foundation of the new society.Moreover, at a time it appeared that the national identity was completely taken away by Malaysian Parliament voting 126-0 to expel Singapore from its realm. The reason for that decision was rising suspicions that People's Action Party (PAP, the major political party of Singapore) has a powerful communist lobby inside it. Lee Kuan Yew (an architect of Singapore's miracle) even stated on the television conference: ""For me, it is a moment of anguish."". In only 50 years the Red Dot has became one of the wealthiest country on Earth.Singapore today is the darling of economists and a contentious point in discussions between proponents of classical democratic principles and supporters of ""guided democracies"".Officially, the city-state is a parliamentary democracy with the Prime Minister and its Cabinet members appointed by the President which is elected by popular vote. Singapore Parliament has 84 members which are also selected on general elections. There is a multi-party system in Singapore with such parties as Parti Pekerja Singapura (Workers' Party, left) or Singapore People's Party (SPP, center) competing on general election with PAP. However, on each elections since 1966 PAP has came as an absolute winner with 60 or more percents of the votes and 80 or more seats in the Parliament.International human rights organizations including Amnesty International or Reporters Sans Frontieres often point to an absence of basics freedoms in Singapore including freedom of press or freedom of assembly. At the same time, Singapore consistently ranks highest as the least corrupt and the most suitable for business country in the World.Instead of pumping oil, gold, diamond or exploiting offshore bankings as do other small but prosperous countries, The Red Dot used its strategic position near Southeast Asia's trade lines to convert itself into the giant finance, technology and commodity hub. The rule of law, comprehensive business regulations, political stability and openness to innovations have transformed the Garden City from small and dirty sea port into the World's leader by the number of millionaires (every six of Singaporean reported to possess more than $1 million of disposable assets).On the downside, being highly dependent on the state of international trade and finance, Singapore remains sensitive to the World's economic cycles. Reflecting the recent Worldwide economic slowdown, city-state's GDP growth rate has been sliding from almost 40% in 2010 to almost 0% today. At the same time, low unemployment rate (2%) and rising deflationary pressure (from 6% in 2012 to -2% in 2016) suppress investments into Singapore future developments.The Lion City - the wonder of World's economy in 80s, 90s and 2000s - is today in a growing jeopardy. However, it still presents itself a wonderful illustration of unprecedented social and economic progresses achieved in a lifetime of one generation."
what is the aim	what is the aim of science	0	Zilch. Nada. Nothing.There is no intrinsic purpose to life, that one must do this, or that you were created for that.This may seem depressing, but it is an inevitability. We live in a world of opportunities, and the reality is that seizing these opportunities and physically making a change is the only difference between those whom find purpose in life and those who don’t.Now another point to be made is the reasons that people ask this question:Often people who are depressed, or under distress [due to their financial situation, or other reasons], will ask this question because nothing seems to go their way, and they are losing hope, so they ask this question because they want to know if there is a supernatural way to get out of this, as for them they seem to be unable to do anything.Equally, other people ask this question because they don’t enjoy the career that they do, or the life that they life, so they ask this question because they feel tied to a monotonous life which is not theirs. As if they are destined for more.Some people ask this question due to their religion, which attempts to explain these issues, and especially as science is still plodding through methodically trying to find a concrete explanation. They are generally looking for answers, because their life cannot provide them.In either scenario, everyone wants what they do not have, and are looking towards the supernatural or the “universe” to answer their question and do what they are unable to do.From this, the real meaning of this question is a self-examination of ones life and priorities, which have revealed some deficiencies and decisions that were made unnecessarily and/or without a clear purpose, and after the consequences of these one is trying to re-evaluate, considering that the divine may be able to bring the change that they could not.The point of life is: live your life the way you want, not anyone else wants. Pursue your goals, and to hell with anyone who comes in your way.For more, follow here.	"It obviously depends on the particular science. Re-phrase the question for neuroscience, theoretical physics, astrophysics, etc as well as for all social sciences, humanities, etc. They will all be anthropo-centered and never Object-Oriented-Ontologies. As for philosophy see my suggestions-My answer assumes that you can and wish to think for yourself and not merely blindly tread your way through the institutionalized tradition of the History of Western Philosophical Idea.This is such a ‘vast’ question to which there are endless answers. It depends on the age, the philosophical and general educational background, culture and other factors and most important -the reason why someone would read philosophy? 99.999% readers will fall into one of the following groups.For general reading, to know something about the subject, as a new under- or post-graduate student, serious scholar, teacher, critic? The remaining .00001% will be original and creative philosophers or potentially creative-thinking ones. I am one of the latter and what ones reads could negatively affect one’s passionate need for philosophy.For the former, Google Wikipedia ‘philosophy’ to get a background to the subject. You will see the branches/domains/subject-matter you are interested in and read that. See Wikipedia’s ‘External Links’ for similar resources and note “Stanford.”The article provides you the names/books in chronological order and as branches. Too many to list. You can also Google any university and view their Philosophy Curriculum and read the suggested books for the different years.A few suggestions, merely my own -You must read a book/philosopher in the context of his time and culture - that is if you wish to get the most out of it and hope to attain greater understanding through assimilation of his intentions and ideas.Please acquaint yourself with the tools employed by philosophers, for example this ‘directory’ The Philosopher's Toolkit: A Compendium of Philosophical Concepts and Methods, 2nd EditionJulian Baggini, Peter S. Fosl ISBN: 978-1-405-19018-3 Wiley-BlackwellThis will show you HOW philosophers think, their methods and techniques.(a) I myself work in ‘meta-philosophy’ (100 books for FREE download where I am in the top 0.5% of 500,000 academics here - Ulrich de Balbian - Academia.edu ) or search my name on Online Shopping for Electronics, Apparel, Computers, Books, DVDs & more. It is the philosophical study of philosophy (its subject-matter, nature, aims etc). Two works of mine I think is crucial - (i) Philosopher as lover of wisdom and wisdom research - and (ii) Philosophizing is part of (the processes of) Theorizing. Both on amazon. com and FREE drafts at http://Academic.edu(b) See Suber’s class handout for students covering many themes and questions of ‘Meta-Philosophy’. Peter Suber, ""Metaphilosophy, Topics"""
how should i respond to my boss who fired me via email	is it okay to fire someone via email	0	How should I respond to my boss who fired me via email and let him know that I’m very disappointed that he did not have the courtesy to do this face-to-face (we work from different states, but always communicate through video calls)?	I might make an exception for merely confirming the end of a temporary assignment, but in the vast majority of cases, NO.It's not illegal, but it is disrespectful, cowardly, unprofessional, and increases the likelihood that the exiting employee will bring a claim against the company arising from some real or imagined adverse condition relating to their employment. They are also more likely to disparage the company to others (often, but not always, using accurate information), contact customers and employees to encourage them to consider leaving, and take other actions that may damage the company's reputation as an employer and as a business. Some of these actions may be unlawful, at least in part, but that doesn't mean that the damage isn't real.There are some occasions when following up via email might make sense, especially if the employee is being provided with advance notice of their final day of employment (as may be the case if they are temporary employees at the end of an assignment, for example), but only after the employee has been notified in person.

what are the conditions in european refugee camps	how are the conditions inside european refugee camps	1	I would like to complement Maya Las answer with some information about the situation in Sweden. First hand information.In my city, Sundsvall, we have a refugee camp that has been around for 35 years. It is quite OK. It is an old mental hospital that was closed down when moden psykofarma made it obsolete. Refugees lives in apartments of several rooms, used to be one refugee in every room and a shared kitchen. Low standard but much higher than anything offered to swedish military conscripts. Then in 2011 the Swedish government made an agreement with Miljöpartiet that ment:All refugees that claimed to be from Syria were to be granted asylum Any refugee that claimed to be a child was to be considered a childRefugees that was denied asylum were to be allowed to stay in refugeecamps and be granteed housing, food and pocket money until they decided to leave.This agreement had consequencies that no one could have predicted (source: the Swedish government). For example: our refugeecamps were crowded. New refugeecamps were established. We runned out of abandoned military baracks and mental hospitals. Other abandoned buildings had to be used. This ment that refugees were housed in of side buildings with low standards. Sweden has a lot of empty space but it is uninhabitated by a reason (think Siberia).Many refugees are now very disapointed when they are housed in abondoned buildings in the middle of nowhere. In Timrå there are some military baracks indended for temporary use were refugees are housed. The refugees have been protesting against living there.Then when we runned out of baracks in the forrest new alternatives had to be found. In Sundsvall we now have refugees living in sports hall. Sleeping on the floors. The situation is creating problems. Different refugees are mixed and conflicts occures. Imagining Shia muslims and Sunni muslims living together. People are being killed and raped. This could also not have been predicted: When arriving to Sweden all refugees were supposted to end their conflicts and live in peace and harmony in Sweden (why dont they just shake hands?)Some refugees are also very disapointed and refuse to leave their buss when arriving to the new low standard refugeecamps. This is very chocking for Swedes. We are expecting the refugees to be greatful and the standard of living is still higher than we had as military conscripts, but we did not have to share room with traumatised people whos language we did not understand, we had a limited time to live in tents in the cold Swedish winter and so on. .....Now the swedish government are doing adjustments in our refugeepolicies. We are now becoming die hard strict instead of super generous  	I would like to complement Maya Las answer with some information about the situation in Sweden.

We are expecting the refugees to be greatful and the standard of living is still higher than we had as military conscripts, but we did not have to share room with traumatised people whos language we did not understand, we had a limited time to live in tents in the cold Swedish winter and so on. .....Now the swedish government are doing adjustments in our refugeepolicies. We are now becoming die hard strict instead of super generous  
what is the opposite of homebird	what is the opposite of take off	0	"The original question is:What is the opposite of ""home-bird""?Answer:Home-bird is a stay-at-home person, a homebody whose life and interests are centred on the home.The opposite of home-bird is a wanderer, who is seldom ever homesick."	"Take off as a verb has a number of different uses. It may also be a hyphenated noun, Take-off.Remove or Divest; as in, for example, ""Take off (an item of clothing or adornment)"". In this case the opposite would be Put on, as in ""I put on (an item of clothing etc.)""Take to the air; as in, for example, ""The (rocket/plane/balloon/bird) took off"". In this case, the opposite would be Land, as in, ""I saw the (rocket/plane/balloon/bird) land"". Sometimes, in relation to an accident, you may see, e.g., ""The car struck a barrier and took off""; the opposite  is Crash, or Crash-landAccurately measure and describe volumes, amounts, areas or quantities; like an estimator or quantity surveyor does for a Schedule of Works or Bill of Quantities, as in ""Peter will take off the quantities in the office extension"" . Depending on context, the opposite might include Ignore, Bypass, Discount, Leave - or simply Not take off.Unload; as in, for example, ""The (crane/ground crew/team etc.) will take off the crates"". Again, depending on context, the opposite might include Ignore, Bypass, Discount, Leave - or simply Not take off.Mimic; as in, for example, ""The artist will take off a British accent in his performance"".  The opposite could be, for example, Not attempt or Not take off.Hope I've covered sufficient possibilities for your purposes (there might be some I haven't thought of)!"
how do you know that your fiance loves you	what are the things that you love the most about your fiance	0	If you’re questioning it, that’s not a good sign. If they love you, you will know. They want you in their lives and they put you there. They genuinely care about your well being. They support you and want you to be successful and happy. All couples need time apart to keep things healthy so if that’s the case, don’t worry. Most people on this planet cannot spend 24/7 with ANYONE and not get annoyed and frustrated so time apart is good. It’s good to miss each other. You may want to sit down and have a chat with them if you’re not sure where the relationship is going. If you’re just having cold feet and need reassurance, you have to talk to them.	"The Hell I was forced to live in for nearly two years.This is a long story, but I feel it has secrets that I must tell.For the first half of my teenaged years, my life was privileged and I was ignorantly blissful. From the ages 13–16, all was well and lovely.I was beautiful. Enviable smooth skin, long blonde hair, hazel eyes. I was tall and tanned and slender and my parents were wealthy and I had everything I thought I could want.I went on dates when I turned 15 every Friday night. I'd go bowling with my friends. We'd go ice skating and shopping and we'd laugh in the streets and everyone would look at us. We wore pretty clothes and had perfect makeup, and we all were identical in our looks. I thought this was what I had to offer. Beauty. The ability to make others jealous.This all changed when I turned 16.My step-father was having an affair. He left myself, my brother, and my uneducated, ignorant mother quickly and effortlessly. He never looked back.My mother was forced to move us two hours away from our private school. My step-father stopped paying for it, so my brother and I had to go to a public school. My friends stopped talking to me.We lived in a low budget area. My mother found work as a maid, but it wasn't enough.One day, I came home from school, and 80% of my clothing was gone. My old makeup was missing too.I asked my mother where it was. She told me she sold it to one of her clients, and she left her makeup bag at a bus stop, so she took mine.My mother only cared about how she looked. As did I. She taught me to. She didn't care about anything else, other than her looks.My face began to break out horribly. I got acne everywhere.I went to school in cheap shorts and t-shirts everyday, with a shitty book bag. Boys didn't look at me anymore. I was horrified. Everything changed. It felt like I was living in a different world. My hair got dry and brittle, from all the days I straightened and curled it. I had no products to fix it.I got scarily skinny. My curves were gone.Who was I without my beauty, I wondered. I didn't know.Now, I'm sure I know what you're thinking: the vapid rich girl who turned into the ugly poor one got what she deserved. And you're right. I was proud and arrogant and spoiled. I did get what I deserved.But this is only the beginning of the story. I told you it was a long one.By the time I was 17, I accepted my pimples, and my crap hair, and the loss of my beauty. I learned that I actually had a personality.As I began to gain back a slight bit of confidence, my mother lost all of hers.She stopped working. She said it made her look bad to work as a maid for rich people, in houses that used to look like our own.We got evicted, and became homeless.My biological father lived in Scotland. He couldn't help us, and at the time, I doubted that he'd want to.My brother got a job as a dishwasher in a restaurant. He's the one that truly suffered it all. He was a good person. Popular at our old school for all the right reasons. He was kind and intelligent, talented. Handsome. While my mother and I were both terrible people, he was an amazing one.He barely made anything working. We slept under freeway underpasses. A far cry from where we used to live.Men bothered me constantly.Some wanted sex, others yelled at me, calling me pizza face and telling me to buy a mask.I was assaulted on a number of occasions.I cried everyday. I felt so sorry for myself. So embarrassed. I had Polaroids of my old boyfriends and I, of my old ""friends"" and I. I was stunning, and still, that's all I could think about - my loss of beauty.I forgot about my personality for a while.We still went to school. Everyone knew we were homeless. It was a moderately small town.The owner of the restaurant my brother worked at allowed us to stay in his backhouse that was infested with roaches, among other things.There was only cold water, and no electricity..."

mathematical fallacies what is wrong in this proof that 22  5	how would mathematics change had 2 plus 2 been equal to 5	0	Check the line where they have taken the square root.9/2 is 4.5. so, +(9/2 - 4)=-(9/2–5) because in square root, it can be either of the two but not necessarily both. You do have to check the sign. That is the mistake.Hope it helps.	I guess to answer the question we'd need some more information.  What would you want 5-2 to be?If you say 2+2 = 5 and 5-2 = 2, then all you've done is reassigned the symbol 5 to the number which is 2+2.  You'd need another symbol for the number which succeeds 2+2, perhaps X.  Then arithmetic would be unchanged except you've replaced all 4's with 5's and all 5's with X's.If you say 2+2=5 and 5-2 =3, then we are in trouble.  Because then on one hand, (2+2)-2 = 5-2 =3, and on the other hand 2+(2-2) = 2+0 = 2.  So 3=2.  Subtracting 2 from both sides, 1=0.  And if 1=0, then 1+1=0+0, so 2=0.  If 2=0, then 2+1=0+0, so 3=0.  Continuing in this fashion, we can show all integers are equal to 0.  Thus all of arithmetic would collapse into a single number: zero.The only way out would be to allow (2+2)-2 and 2+(2-2) to be different numbers.  That means the addition operation would break the associative law.  Without the associative law it is very hard to do any arithmetic at all since you cannot combine more than two numbers reliably.
will it help cibil score if i pay off my writtenoff amount	does my cibil score gets impacted if i only pay the minimum due amount	0	"A healthy CIBIL report and a chance to get a loan will increase. According to research data analysis based on CIBIL (Credit Information Bureau (India) Ltd., 79% credit and credit cards of credit and credit cards have been approved for individuals 750 and above.The first step towards developing a healthy CIBIL report is to understand its contents. One of the most important components of the Credit Report is the ""Accounts"" section. This section contains all the debts and credit cards details including creditors type, type of loan facility (home, auto, personal, overdraft, etc.), account numbers, ownership details, date opened, last payment date, loan amount, current balance and Monthly record of your payments (up to 3 years). This section also provides ""status"" in the account which defines the ""health"" of the account. A person's credit report and they mean that there are some common status flags here:Closed: If you find a date near the 'Closed' field in your account section, the loan account is closed with the lender. In other words, you can pay your loan completely and report this account as ""closed"" to CIBIL.After closing the loan, it is very important to get the No Deals Certificate (NDC) from the lender, banks issue a No Dee Certificate (NCD) or Closing Letter, Closing the Debt and ""Covered"" to your CIBIL Report.Settlement: If you have partially repaid debt or credit card or credit card, then the status in your credit report is ""settled"". When you have an account settled, the credit company agrees to accept the minimum payment amount on the original payment amount. As the lending institution loses the risk, the ""settled"" status can be considered negative and the possibility of loan approval is considered to be detrimental.Your CIBIL TransUnion score does not affect the ""Settlement"" flag, your credit history will show a ""settled"" status in your CIBIL report and reflects Day-Past-Deu because the loan payment is not timely. Each bank has its own policy of looking at a ""secured"" status and determines your future loan applications.Written Off: When you can not pay more than 180 days for an outstanding loan/credit card, the lender will require a ""Write-Off"" in question. The lender then reported on your CIBIL report as ""retained off"". A lender who is willing to give credit or credit card to those who do not repay their debts or credit cards is a risk of approval for your loan or credit card applications.If the CIBIL report shows a ""settled"" or ""written off"" status, then the person may be harder to get a loan.""Finance ready"" helps you understand the points in your credit history and work them to better cibil report and build a score.The number of reports to be paid by the CBIL report is between Rs 550 and Rs 1200. For companies, CIBIL reports a flat rate every time and charges 3000 a company request for a score."	If you want to know about any impact on your credit score (CIBIL score) by paying only Minimum Due Amount then first you need to understand what is the term minimum amount due.Minimum Amount Due is the amount of money that you are required to pay on your credit card statement each month before due date for :No late payment chargesYour account not to be reported as irregular to the credit bureausOn the other hand, let’s understand what happens when you pay only Minimum Amount Due:You need to pay interest on outstanding amount.There will be no grace period on new purchases .Which means you have to pay interest on all of them for next period and do remember interest rates on credit cards are INSANELY High.Now paying minimum balance for even one month leads to the situation when you will not get a grace period until you pay the outstanding balance in full for two billing cycles in a row.This situation is ideal for Credit Card Companies and their business runs because of customers who pay minimum balance without realizing that it leads to debt trap.The only thing you are getting by paying the minimum balance is that the Credit Card company is not reporting your account to credit bureaus (e.g. CIBIL) as irregular but wait that doesn’t mean it can’t impact your credit score.Minimum Amount Due is not directly used (or as publicized) in credit score calculations.But that does not mean that this state will be maintained in future.Credit Card Companies do send all the information about how you are using the credit card to credit bureaus, it’s just that this factor is currently not used directly in the model of computing the score.But it can affect the score indirectly because of another factor on which the Credit Score directly depends and that is the Credit Utilization Ratio .It is the Amount Owed divided by the Total Available Credit Limit given by the creditor and the lower it is the better.You should strive to keep the Credit Utilization Ratio as low as possible (if possible less than 30%)Now when you pay only Minimum Amount Due then Credit Utilization Ratio increases and will have adverse effect on the score.This situation is more prominent when available credit limit is low.So paying Minimum Amount Due is never a good idea for your overall financial well being.In case of any doubts just follow the cardinal rule of credit card use :PAY BALANCE IN FULL(Image from Stock Market Gamification App )I hope it helps.
should the hobbit be considered a canonical tolkien work	what is the proper canonical spelling of middleearth in tolkien  works	0	"The question of what constitutes Tolkien's canon is considerably more contentious than Balrog wings.The Hobbit is a work written by Tolkien and published in his lifetime; it is therefore canon in that sense.It became, in the process of being written, connected to older and greater stories Tolkien had written and would continue revising until his death in 1973.The Lord of the Rings was written with the intent that it be a sequel to The Hobbit. It is canonical in that sense.There are however a host of issues to consider. Should we consider the 1st, 2nd or 3rd edition as canon? How do goblins late in the Third Age recognize swords from the First Age? ""Tra-la-la-lally here down in the Valley,"" WTF!? Dogs serving as waiters to a were-bear, cockney talking purses, huh?There is a subset of fans who want to be able to say that this is canon and that is not. This character would definitely beat that character in a duel. This Ring would affect that character in exactly this way. Elves could see a great distance because of these specific genetic differences. In my mind this is trying to hold Middle-earth to a standard that is completely unrealistic. However we might wish it to be, Middle-earth and the tales surrounding were a work in progress that Tolkien never finished to his own satisfaction.We, as fans, have had the good fortune to have Christopher Tolkien provide us with a vast collection of his father's unpublished work; along with his own insight and opinions regarding same. This cornucopia of source material however makes it sometimes easy to lose sight of the fact that we are talking about a fairy-tale.My own view is that there is a spectrum of  ""canonicity""  rather than a strictly defined canon. I would place The Hobbit ""lower"" than Lord of the Rings but ""higher"" than much of what is published in The Return of the Shadow (HoMe Vol VI) i.e. Bingo Baggins and Trotter. My own general rule of thumb is to look for the composition date of material in question and to accord greater weight to work written at a later time, but even this rule has exceptions."	Who was the wisest elf in Middle-earth? There are conflicting statements in Tolkien's canonical works regarding the relative wisdom of Cirdan, Galadriel, Celeborn and Elrond Peredhil. How can they be reconciled?
what do japanese think about malaysian	what do malaysians think about indians	0	Most of us view South East Asians as happy friendly people in a lump thanks to a lot of Filipinos in Japan but can not actually distinguish them with Malaysians (they all have tanned skins with big eyes) since most of us do not have a chance to see Malaysians in our daily life. Unless we travel there, we only know the country through TV shows that indicate Malaysia and Singapore are a bit more developed than Philippines or Indonesia etc.From the impression, the advanced level ranking in SE Asia would be like:Singapore > Malaysia > the rest of the countries	"Today, the Indian community in Malaysia, once largely a community of plantation workers, has become diversified with a sprinkling of entrepreneurs, intellectuals and technical professionals. Though the vast majority of Indians in Malaysia still lag behind Malays and Chinese in socio-economic terms, the new immigrants are slowly affecting change. The new Indian immigrants, (mostly technology professionals, and the strides made by the tiny Malaysian Indian middle class have given Indians in Malaysia a facelift.But perceptions toward Indians have not changed dramatically. Malaysia's survey of race relations, released in March last year, paints an unflattering, stereotypical image of Indians in Malaysia. Mantras like ""the Malays are lazy, the Chinese are greedy and the Indians are cheats"" are still a part of Malaysian lore.The reasons for the socio-economic backwardness of Indians in Malaysia can be traced to their immigration history.The second wave of Indians came as auxiliaries, mostly from North India, as part of the police force and security services. About the same time also came Indians from Kerala and Sri Lankan Tamils from Jaffna to work as clerks and subordinate civil servants. The third stream of immigrants came as traders, most predominant among these were the Chettiars, a South Indian moneylending caste.The latest wave of Indian immigration started toward the end of the last century when Malaysia, like its neighbor Singapore, began looking at India as a source for knowledge economy professionals. Starting in the 1970s, Malaysia began a transition to an industrialised economy, aided by its petroleum boom. In later decades, as the world economy globalized, Malaysia sought to become a services hub and develop a knowledge-based economy. Indians in the IT sector were especially sought after. Malaysia even formally signed a Memorandum of Understanding with India on manpower recruitment on a contract basis in March 2005.The other segment of Indian diaspora is not as confident, nor as successful. Some of the poorest laborers in Malaysia are Indians, living a hand to mouth existence. In 2000, TimeAsia reported that Indians have the lowest share of the nation's corporate wealth: 1.5%, compared to 19.4% for the Malays and 38.5% for the Chinese. The highest rate of suicide of any community is among Indians. Gangsterism and violent crime is largely associated with Indians. In 1994, 128 of the 377 murders committed in Malaysia were by Indians. Some 15% of the Indians in the capital are squatters.P.S: The above article has been taken from a Malaysian portal.However I would like to add personally that Malaysia is a semi-dictatorial state. The native Malay Muslims enjoy most benefits. I am not sure why the Indians do not do as well as the Chinese."
is the har ki dun trek easy	can i take 10 month baby to base camp of har ki dun trek	0	This trek is of Easy-to-Moderate intensity. Starting point for the trek to Har Ki Dun is Taluka village (2110 m, 6922 ft). Trail runs along the tributary of Tons river and has few steep climbs and descents. Round trip trek duration is 4-days. Distance from Taluka to Seema (13  Km) is covered on the first day, and from Seema to Har Ki Dun (12 Km)  is covered on second day. Trekkers usually camp at Har-Ki-Dun for one or  two nights. Return route is same as the onward route and also completed  in two days. If trekkers are habituated to trekking long distances (~  20 Km) in one day, they can attempt return journey from Har Ki Dun to  Taluka in one day.The trek takes you to a completely different world which is so close  to the nature and completely free from any kind of gadgets! Beautiful  vistas, unfolding in front of your eyes, are a visual treat. It makes  you appreciate beauty of the Himalayas and the mother nature. This is a  ‘must do’ trek for every nature lover !Fitness:This trek requires endurance. Although it is an easy trek, it can be  quite hard on your knees if you are not accustomed to long distance  (~20-25kms in a day) trekking or walking. Start basic fitness and endurance building at least  2 months prior to trek. You can daily jog for 30 to 40 mins or go out for long duration brisk walking (7 to 10Kms). You can start with 15 minutes and each day increase the duration by 5 minutes or so. You can also go for swiming once or twice in a week to improve stamina and breathing capacity. If you have average active lifestyle (i.e. you walk or so some non-sitting activity at least for 1 hour in a day) None of this is mandatory. However, it will help you a lot during your trek if you do this preparation. Another important consideration is reduced air pressure and hence  reduced oxygen availability at the height of 3500 m above MSL. Usual oxygen percentage in the air at MSL is 20.9, and effective oxygen percentage at 3500 m is  13.5, which is reduction of 35% !! Although for average youngster, this  will not be a significant issue (unless one is couch potato !) as body  will naturally adjust as the trek progresses. Some people might feel  weird feeling as you start final climb before reaching Har Ki Dun.  Hence, stamina building is very important if you really want to enjoy  the trek.More information here:Trek in the Himalayas - Har Ki Dun Trek - Summary - Curious Eagle	Hi,I don't think there will be any snowfall in April. They occur in the month of December- January. Furthermore, if you want to see snow, you have to go beyond Har ki doon in the mountains if you are planning to visit it during April.Some more pictures-:One with a cute resident thereTo see more pics, you can visit my previous answerWhen can one see the best views at the Har Ki Dun trek?Thank you!!

will the supreme court  decision of playing the national anthem before movie screenings affect your patriotism	what are your views on the supreme court  decision to make playing national anthem mandatory in cinema halls	1	My opinion:Let the anthem be played in movie halls on special days, like the Republic Day or Independence day. Playing it every single day before every show in every theatre in the country is, over doing it, in my opinion.Of course, I will stand up whenever and wherever the anthem is played if this decision is enforced.But I am afraid, when it is forced down on millions of people, like this, it detracts from the speciality of the anthem. A movie hall experience is not a formal Government inauguration ceremony, or convocation or similar formal functions. Let the national anthem be special and be put on a pedestal and not made to rub shoulders with advertising jingles we hear over Radio and TV.I hope they don’t start this before every single ODI or Test match, or before every single top rated TV Serial or every time Arnab Goswami opens his Talk show program which may perhaps be named “The Nation wants to know”I am also apprehensive of some zealous state patriots demanding that the State’s Anthem should also be played along with the National anthem. Whatever the logic in favour of playing the national anthem in every theatre in every show, will perhaps be valid for the State Anthem too.I would be curious to know if any country in the world has adopted this practice, or will we be unique in this respect.GV(Patriotic Indian)	My opinion:Let the anthem be played in movie halls on special days, like the Republic Day or Independence day.

First man? First gentleman, First what?Answer: List of first gentlemen in the United States - First GentlemanBut the husband of a President? First Lord sounds too archaic. First Husband sounds a bit weird. First Gentleman, although that’s a bit long. Bill is a funny one. :-)Bill Clinton once suggested “First Laddie” as he told jokingly. Too Scottish, though…Still, there are a few female Governors in the USA and a few female Presidents in the World. Their husbands are generally known as “First Gentleman” but the media generally avoids using that name.But technically, “First Gentleman” is as unofficial as “First Lady” as it is just a term used by the media and not an official title. The official title for the partner of a President is technically just their name. Melanie Trump right now, for the USA. The media seems to avoid calling her First Lady. And they can do so as it is not an official title. Being married to the President doesn’t give you a special title…	This answer deals with a hypothetical world where a single woman would be elected president.So lets look at history for possible reference points. James Buchanan was an elected bachelor so he didn't have a wife to play the role of First Lady. In his case his niece Harriet Lane took over the responsibilities of the First Lady and is recognized as the First Lady during his tenure as president.If we take into account widowers who were elected presidents such as Thomas Jefferson, Andrew Jackson, Martin Van Buren and Chester A. Arthur, their deceased wives are considered their First Ladies. Even though someone else might have done job of First Lady the deceased partner is still given the title.In our situation if the elected President was not a widow, chances are whomever they appointed to take the role would be given the title. If they appointed a man history might refer to the person as the First Gentleman or if they appointed a woman the White House would have another First Lady.In a situation where the President was a widow, the now deceased partner would be considered the First Gentleman though someone else might take up the job responsibilities instead. In the situation where the elected President had a female spouse the deceased spouse would be referred to as the First Lady.Source: List of First Ladies of the United States

mobile number portability finally will start on may 3 do network providers really agree to this	mobile number portability finally will start on may 3rd including changing circles have network providers really agreed to this	0	Mobile Number Portability is there from Long Back . At present, mobile subscribers can retain their current number only when they switch their service providers within the same service area .This announcement widens the scope for subscribers even when they relocate to another geographical area . You can retain same number if you relocate also , Means same Number which ever state you go ...!  It's TRAI Announcement , they have to accept it. Lets see what will happen ..	Service providers have to agree to MNP as it is amended by law. But network providers usually don't let the customer go easily, they will try everything to keep the customer on their network by providing many services free or at the half price. I don't think changing of circle comes under the MNP policy.
why do people hate twilight saga	why do people hate twilight so much	1	Vampires are supposed to be scary. They are meant to be undead creatures of the night with big fangs that drink blood by biting the neck and have the ability to morph into bats.I don't mind them being able to handle sunlight as long as the reason why makes sense. In the novels “Abraham Lincoln Vampire Hunter” and “The Last American Vampire” it is explained that after the first 100 years of being a vampire, their skin adapts and they can handle sunlight.That makes a hell of a lot more sense to me than Twilight's explanation that sunlight makes them sparkle. Seriously that's just dumb. Also Vampires saying that their vegetarian because they only drink animal blood is just dumb as well. Also based on my one viewing of the first movie and reviews I've watched of the others, I'm pretty sure that they never once are shown turning into bats. Vampires are meant to be scary, not romantic.Oh and Kristen Stewart plays Bella but she can't act to save her life. She always has the same expression on her face. This is a terrible love story and it's the one most people blame for starting the trope of love triangles in books and movies. Joker and Harley's abusive one-sided romance makes more sense than this.Also the last movie has a big battle which turns out to just be a vision that one of the psysic good guys shows villain would happen if they fought. Yeah that battle, it never happened. That's a terrible way to end the series.You'll notice that I haven't mentioned the werewolves yet. Why's that? Because they're fine for the most part. They turn into wolves and they actually look right. I'd still prefer if they were scary or if the transformation was shown to be very painful and terrifying like in most movies, but I'm ok without that. However don't think that means I'm giving Jacob a pass.So Bella chose to marry and have a kid with vampire Edward over him. That's fine. But you know what isn't fine, when Jacob becomes a pedophile by imprinting on Bella's daugther, Nessie (“You nicknamed my daughter after the loch Ness monster?!!” I will never be able to take that stupid line seriously.) Jacob imprinted on a newborn baby happened to be the daughter of his ex and decided to protect and be with her. He will fall in love with her when she gets old enough. I don't care that Nessie is a vampire human hybrid that ages faster, it's still messed up pedophilia.This movie and book series is terrible, it's the worst movie and book series to ever exist. When I first heard anything about it, I was told that it's about Vampires vs Werewolves. Thats not even remotely true. Its a terrible love story and the wereworlve don't show up until the second movie. Girls liking it because they have a crush on Jacob or Edward, that's an okay excuse. But straight guys like myself, have no reason to enjoy this piece of shit. If there was a barrel full of bad movies, this would be at the bottom because it's the absolute worst. If I could do this, I'd gather every copy of the Twilight movies and books, and I'd burn them all. If I had to choose between being brutally murdered and watching or reading the whole Twilight Saga, I'd pick brutally murdered. That's how much I hate Twilight.Edit: Thanks for the upvotes.

do you believe imperialism left a positive or negative legacy in the indian subcontinent and in africa	stepping into corporate life from being a student how does that feel	0	The goal of imperialist states in the colonies was to amass wealth for the development of the crown and use colonies to spread influence abroad. It can be inferred that imperialism from its very definition was not to seek the interests of the colonies or the colonized and therefore worked against the interests of the colonized. Most of them worked like banana republics.However, there were some gains but whatever gains garnered were realized while undertaking projects that increased the exploitation of the colonies. Railway lines constructed from mines to the harbors for example improved the infrastructure of the colonies.Sub-saharan Africans lacked the education and knowledge to carry out many of such projects.	US Perspective:“NGO” in the US usually refers to non-stock corporations or not-for-profit corporations that have obtained 501(c)(3) status. The minimum cost of starting an NGO depends on (1) the cost of forming the corporation, (2) the cost of requesting recognition as an organization exempt from taxation under section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code, and (3) the cost of registering as a charity in the states where you may be conducting fundraising activities.Here is an example breakdown:In New York, the filing fee for forming a not-for-profit corporation is $75. You will also want to get a certified copy of your Certificate of Incorporation, which costs $10. ($85 total)The application for recognition for exemption from taxation under section 501(c)(3) is IRS Form 1023. There are two versions, an expedited Form 1023-EZ which requires your organization to meet certain criteria, and a more general Form 1023. The cost for filing Form 1023-EZ online is $275. The cost for filing regular Form 1023 is $400 if the organization has not or does not anticipate to have gross revenue over $40,000 over a 4 year period, or $850 if it does. Most organizations that file regular Form 1023 pay $850.Nonprofits that solicit contributions n NY or from NY persons or entities, and nonprofits formed under NY law or conducts activity in NY, must register with the NY charities bureau using Form 410. The fee for soliciting contributions is $25. (IncTotal minimum start-up cost for NY NGO:1023-EZ, no NY solicitation: $360.1023-EZ, NY solicitation: $385.1023, $40K gross in 4 years, no NY solicitation: $485.1023, $40K gross in 4 years, NY solicitation: $510.1023, over $40K gross in 4 years, no NY solicitation: $935.1023, over $40K gross in 4 years, NY solicitation: $960.
why is c the best programming language	lua and c which one is the best programming language for embedded systems	0	Everyone writes about C++ and Java or even C. The question was what is the best language to start learning NOW in 2014 not 1994.C++ is widely used because it's absolutely general purpose. But writing in it takes time... But seriously, a lot of it. Same for CJava right now is used mostly for android and enterprise software. However the latter slowly moves to other languages. Why? Because Java is horribly redundant and boilerplated. If not android it'd be dying language.Python is good, but it's not so new or innovative. Whilst if You want to learn something from scratch You'd want something that yields great productivity and top technologies.But now what is really good language to start learning.The most useful right now is - unfortunately - JavaScript. Why? Because You can write anything in it. From websites through desktop apps (node-webkit, TideSDK), mobile apps (Cordova PhoneGap) ending on web servers and even realtime app servers (Node.js)It's extremely useful if You want to write little apps that don't require type checking and more advanced structuring.What's next? Ruby. Why? Because it's most popular language on github and stack overflow right now. Community is the most important part of any environment. What's more Ruby has been created with easiness of development and fast iteration in mind. Thanks to that You can ship Your product the fastest.But what if You want to write huge servers that are typesafe and have no performance overhead? Scala. Why? Ask LinkedIn for example. They moved their whole infrastructure into Scala and they say it has been the best move they could make.Although Scala has very steep learning curve it's worth the commitment. Martin Odersky the creator of Scala has been working on Generics system in early Java dev and he claims it's so broken he had to write language from scratch. What's more Scala uses Functional paradigm which is becoming widely popular because Amdahl's law started to matter much more than Moore's law in today's CPU architecture.PS. Even Quora uses ScalaIf You want to learn language that is popular now. OK pick C++ or Java. But if You want to learn something that will give You advantage over people with 20 year inertia. Pick one of the above/Edit other language that is worth taking look at is Go but I don't know much about it so I won't take a voice./Edit2 For iOS dev Swift is the one too/Edit3 For scalable distributed systems with nine nines of availability there's also Elixir. It's pretty new (3 years now) but it's really worth looking at. It's a maturity of Erlang with productivity of Ruby. Cool stuff/Edit4 Rust language seems to grow as a potential C++ competitor. And everything suggests it's a good trait to follow too/Edit 1.09.2015To all of You who's been upvoting my answer for last several months. I'm elated with all Your kind words. I've never thought it's going to be so popularOnce again thanks for such amazing feedback of Yours! Quora community rocks!Cheers,Chris	"There is no best programming language. There are fitting languages for a problem.C is a very efficient language, that is compiling to almost no overhead on most modern compilers (almost leaves still a lot to optimize, trust me with that), Lua on the other hand is one of the smallest embeddable HLL, that gives a lot for the 3 kb of code that it will “blow up” your application and the 120 kb of library code that will “hog your computer”.Luajit is indeed one of the fastest HLL you can ever get, only modern Javascript can come up to it’s speed, but how near (or better) it comes, it will eat away a lot more of your system for that. A LOT.So, you usually have the three levels of application programming:Application programming (HLL, script languages)Implementation programming (algorithms, implementation, libraries, systemOptimization (hardware layer, ASM, GPU, serving specialized chipsets)While level 2 is usually done by a compiling language, that is trading speed for flexibility and compiles into a more or less static application, level 1 is scriptable, flexible and gives you on the user-level a lot of leeway for configuration and changing the dataflow.Script level languages are usually much slower, can hog your application with a garbage collection that you may or may not control at all, but it gives you a lot of power for a near-English level programming interface, that even your average user can deal with.Typical example is the LibreOffice spreadsheet. 1) is the programming of the sheet and the cells 2) is the implementation of the program 3) is using the GPU if OpenCL is available for calculating the cells. Perfect example and you can easily see why the heck you need level one in almost every project.And why also configuration files are much better if you do them in a HLL like Lua. Bad thing about HLL is usually that they hog your system, so on an embedded computer you need something fast, that isn’t eating what little you have away. That’s not worth it. So the price of that level one is very important.Lua is as powerful as Python and even easier to write, but comes at costs that are like factor 20 to factor 50 lower, depending of what you are doing. Python doesn’t have that easy interface to go down from HLL to C, the easy C API of Lua is almost unique among the languages we have.You do not decide between those two programming languages, you are using them as a team, they are a very powerful combination.Think about what PHP did the the static HTML in 1995: it created the modern Web 2.0 and with that changed the world. This means to insert something intelligent, something dynamic into a static structure and enable to access the content in a flexible and intelligent way.You insert Lua into your C application and you will create the revolution of App 2.0.We are on the threshold of that revolution. You don’t decide which one to use, you take the package and burn down the house with it. It’s time for it, our software is crap and inflexible. It needed a long time for this.Luajit is available for all platforms and I would lay that to your heart, because it’s the most powerful implementation of Lua, while Lua 5.3 is just the most modern one, but it lacks a lot of the power and comes with a much higher price to pay.It needs a little bit more of code space for the Luajit library, but the 150 kb for usual Lua and 400 kb for Luajit is pretty damn well worth it. Lua is twenty times faster than PHP or Python, by the way and eats only a tiny fraction of the memory. And it yields all the power.So, I guess it’s a good choice for going embedded. Yielding a lot of power is something that you might want on those systems.Read more about Luajit on the page: The LuaJIT ProjectIt’s a pretty good deal you get with that, as I say there’s nothing that Lua 5.3 can do that you can’t do in 5.1 and there is a lot a whole lot Luajit can do, that you can’t do with the vanilla versions.Like FFI to start with (direct access to all system libraries with no need for glue-code!), like Bitfields, like JIT control, GC control and all that. Also, many projects like Love2D and others that are indeed going into this are implementing with JIT. For a little trade of 250 kb of code you get like 10 times the speed, means you get down to just factor 2 behind pure C usually, while that can become worse if you do it wrong, of course.But you usually don’t implement time consuming things in Lua itself, you implement that in C and just call it. Like we did back on our 8-bit machines with BASIC. If you look at Tiobe, Lua is on place 30 or so, but you should give a damn on that. Because that index totally fails on something like Lua. Because it is counted as just a “feature” of your application, not the applications language. Which is wrong.So Lua will never climb above 20 on that index. Even if everything is done with it. But you are jumping in and out of Lua all the time, enter C, work there, jump back to Lua. You can call Lua from C and you can write Lua libraries in C and call with that C from Lua, you can call everything from everything, like directly call functions in Lua from C or the other way around. This is really unique.So, don’t decide between those two languages, like you would not decide what you need for your car: the motor or the wheels.This team is very very powerful and we will get to the App 2.0 revolution with it. Many good programs are switching at the moment or better Lua-enhancing their functionality. It also means you can directly communicate with everything over the Lua interface on the net, on your computer or on any layer the future might bring and of which you didn’t think when you designed your program and compiled it.Check Neovim, LuaLaTeX/LuaTeX, Nmap, Snort and many more.List of applications using Lua - Wikipedia also check the free Love2D game engine and all the games done with Lua. That language can serve the real time demand that a game will load on it’s shoulder, so don’t worry. It can multithread and has real coroutines, does more or less everything Python can but Python can’t do some of the things Lua can. And it does it slowly and sluggish. Don’t know why they hyped Python so much.Lua is also cheap to learn. If you need more than two days to grasp the principles, you are doing something wrong. There are just 21 basic commands, that’s even less than C. But it is expandable and you can program and make out of it, what you like, up to an object orientated mess, if you like this kind of stuff.I mean, sometimes it’s just what you’ll need, so good to have it. Or real functional programming: you got it.So. Don’t decide between those two languages. Bind them together like dynamite and the ignitor and go move some stuff. You can go and blow some old stuff to kingdom come, if you do it right. Or, or, just take the source of some old crap and insert a Lua interface, make it smart, change the world that is at minimal costs.App 2.0 is coming.But don’t listen to me, make up your own mind and test it: Lua Tutorial Took me just a few hours to learn that, but to read the whole Lua book will consume more time. The interfacing with C goes into details, that might cost you a week. But it’s well worth it. Usage? Is coming with nearly no costs at all.To not learn Lua is not rational, I say. And it gave me much more than Python did give me. Well, the SciKit/Numpy thing in Python is cool. I don’t have that on Lua. Yet. But we will have that. Soon. If not, I’m going to pirate it from Python, which is one of the libraries you have: PlunderPy or what was the name?-- main.luapy = require 'python' sum_from_python = py.import ""sum"".sum_from_pythonprint( sum_from_python(2,3) )Arrrr, but they plundered back!: Lunatic Python - Labix and they know why they are doing it."
how can i improve my spoken english ability	how can i improve my english speaking 	1	Practice. Practice Practice. Never pass up a chance to practice. So, what if you mix things up? Today is just practice. Tomorrow is another day.I am an American who has worked in two dozen countries and spent 10 years in China as well as many years in Germany and several years in Thailand. So, I have much practice with non-native speakers, such as you.1st, you are probably not too bad at English.2nd, You probably put too much pressure on yourself. 3rd, Don’t worry about your mistakes. They are building blocks.4th, Choose an American or Brit or Aussie or Kiwi who you admire, and say to yourself, “Someday, I want to talk one-on-one with that person in good English.”Maybe, that person is Barack Obama. Or maybe, it is Queen Elizabeth. It doesn’t matter. Your choice. In the meantime, everyone else you speak to in English is practice until you meet that special person. From now on, every English speaker you meet is just practice, until you sit down and talk to that one important person. Before that, it is just practice. It doesn’t matter that you fail, each and every day. It’s just practice. So, enjoy your practice and your failure. It’s practice.5th. Again. You are putting too much pressure on your self. Relax.

No. He practiced.Do you think Michael Jordan, the Chicago Bulls basketball hero, scored a three pointer, every time he shot a basketball? The answer is, “No.”The secret :Every time you try to speak English, you are practicing. You practice. You make a mistake. So what??? You go home and learn from what didn’t go as well as you hoped. Then figure out how to make it better.I am lucky to live in Hawaii. Years ago, I wanted to learn Japanese. Everyday, I would go to Waikiki Beach and ask a Japanese tourist questions such as, “What did you do yesterday? Tell me about your job? What do you plan to do in Hawaii?” I would go home and learn learn from my mistakes. The next day, I would go back to the beach and have a new teacher. Step by step, my Japanese becomes better. You should do the same thing.You will not hit a Home Run the first time at bat. But, after 20 times, you will start to hit home runs with some consistency.

She grew up in a small, minority mountain village in China. She set a goal of learning English, (probably because, as a minority, she would not meet her goals in China). From then on, she never passed up an opportunity to try and learn English. That was how we met. I am very, very proud of my wife.

how can i have gay sex	how can i be gay and dislike gay sex	0	THE SECRET TO DOING GAY SEXFind a same-sex partner.Have sex.Really. It's that simple. Gay sex is nothing more or less than sex involving gay people.There are no special gay sex positions. There are no gay sex acts. Everything some gay and bi people do, some straight people do. Tingly parts get rubbed on tingly parts. Things get stuck in places. Places get rubbed on places.Enjoy. Rinse. Repeat.	Sexuality is not a single spectrum but a series of spectra that might to borrow from Peter Flom who uses the metaphor in relation to autism and related conditions, be compared to a ballpark in 3 dimensions. You can have any number of positions in the infield and outfield.Homosexuatiy refers to 3 differing things, whom you are romantically attracted to, whom you are sexually attracted to, and how you identify your own person internally.You can exist anywhere along these three axes. From purely heterosexual to purely homosexual, from asexual to sex addicted or nymphomania, and from static in your identity to completely fluid.Consequently you appear to be attracted to men, to identify as homosexual and to either tends toward asexuality, or else disinterest or dislike of specific sex acts.
i am transferring to a school with a us curriculum taking the ibdp from a philippine school w a percent average grading system how do i get my gpa	i am in tenth grade at a high school in ontario canada i would really love to do an exchange with a student from europe any ideas on how i can go about doing this	0	16 hours. Hmm, you are definitely a focused person. You are doing something that 99% of us are struggling to do.But ask yourself,How much quality time am i spending out of those 16 hours in studying?See, NO. OF HOURS DOESN'T MATTER.Quality > quantityOne could study more in 7-8 hours than what you study in 15–16 hours.Why do you see the no. Of hours? If you are seeing the hours, then you will not be able to focus for studies. You just study. But, This will not give you results.A correct approach is required.Let's play a little game.Answer these easy questions if you can.—What is your name?How old are you?2+2=?Do you have any siblings?In which class do you study?What are the subjects that you study?Which subject do you like the most?You were able to answer all of the above questions. Weren't you? Now ask,WHY?WHY WERE YOU ABLE TO ANSWER ALL THE QUESTIONS SO ACCURATELY?There is a logic behind this. The thing is, when i asked you those questions,You understood all the questions perfectly. That is why you didn't say your age when i asked your name. You answered only what was asked. No more, no less.It means that,YOUR CONCEPT IS 100% CLEAR. You have a brain like everyone else. You are not inferior.YOU ARE BRILLIANT!!!Now, How is it related to studies and toppers?If i ask you what is quantum chromodynamics(QCD)? you might be sitting with mouth open, blank. This is because your CONCEPT is not clear regarding qcd. That is why you didn't answer it. And If the same question would come in your exam, then you would have scored 0 and someone might have scored full. This is whom you would call TOPPER!But this doesn't mean that you are a weak student, you just need to give time and you will also become a topper.The secret to top is crystal like clear concepts. The secret is to make these questions answerable as easy as day to day questions that you come across. Though you might have heard this but this is underrated. A lot.That is why toppers spend a majority of time in understanding theory and spend lesser amount of time in numericals, which are nothing but questioning your theoretical understanding in number form.Pay attention to clear your concepts. If you did not understand from the book, ask your teacher or go to YouTube but never underestimate conceptual clarity.Developing a habit is very important. Make a habit, stick to it. You should have a fixed sleeping and waking up time. Your mind will become comfortable or else you would trouble yourself daily.Study as if you are to teach someone. In my case, whenever i lack clarity in any topic, i find a classmate who also haven't understood the topic and i tell him that I'll explain you the next day(*if he wants to). Then i study with a mindset that i have to explain it to somebody so i must be knowing everything to tackle his doubts. I watch YouTube lectures and study from the books and…i'm done. It's one of the most effective method. It's a business where there are only profits to both sides and absolutely no losses.You need not study the whole day! This is a common misconception among us that toppers study the entire day(*few exceptions present). Instead, they study smartly and do other activities as well. The best example is Roman Saini sir whom i am greatly inspired from. He says that he studied for about 7-8 hours a day, and also learnt playing guitar alongside(watch his ted talk). He is not nobody, he has achieved something that a lot of people in India wants to become desperately. He got selected in AIIMS Delhi and also, he cleared UPSC to become an IAS Officer. He has co founded a great platform for upsc and other competitive exam aspirants with Gaurav Munjal sir, UNACADEMY. I also aspire to become a civil servant and believe me, they are the best!Roman sir says that you should sleep for 8 hours, study for 8 hours and do whatever you want for the next 8 hours. There is no exam that cannot be cleared by studying 6-8 hours daily.SayonaraHave a better you ahead!!-Ritik	Not sure how you can do that in high school but in university you can join AIESEC.   AIESEC brings students from around the world together.  You may be able work abroad as an intern for a company and/or organization The duration usually between 6 months to 1 year.Here's the link...http://aiesec.org/Best of luck!
how do i make money with youtube	how do i make money through youtube	1	Four ways, basically:1. Ad revenue. When there's an ad on a video watch page, the creator of that video shares the revenue from that ad with YouTube. YouTubers aren't allowed to discuss ad rates, but it's generally acknowledged to be between $1 per 1,000 views, up to a few dollars per 1,000 views. Many YouTubers also make sponsored or branded content, in which they share or discuss a product for a fee. This can be very lucrative, but there's also the risk of clouding your authentic relationship with your audience.2. Merchandising. Many YouTube creators sell shirts or mugs featuring logos or inside jokes. There are companies designed for niche creators looking to make merch for their audiences (I co-own one, Don't Forget To Be Awesome). For some YouTubers, this can be a bigger source of income than ads (it is for my brother and me), but for most it's a relatively small business.3. Ancillary products. Many YouTubers are able to use their existing audiences as activation energy for other projects--from tours to music to makeup lines to books. Because many of these projects have better established business models (like, people generally expect to pay for books), this can also be a great business. It's unlikely my novel The Fault in Our Stars would've been so successful without the activation energy provided by the viewers of our videos.4. Subscription fees. This is an emerging business model, but I think a very promising one. Voluntary subscription platforms like Patreon: Support the creators you love allow viewers to support the creators they love directly. This decreases the influence of advertisers and makes creators directly answerable to their audiences. It does, however, require that a percentage of viewers choose to pay. I suspect most YouTubers make most of their money from ads, but I think advertising is probably shrinking percentage-wise as a revenue source, which I think is mostly good news. I think advertising is an important part of funding our online experiences, but ultimately I'd argue the Internet is healthiest when serving the needs of its human users rather than the needs of its corporate sponsors.	In order to start getting paid on YouTube you would start with Adsense, however since the whole Logan Paul indecent, YouTube has changed their policies . Now with Adsense and you need to have at least 1000 subscribers and at least 4000 hours of watch time as of the beginning of 2008Of course if you are just starting out , you don’t have this so here are a few ways to create a YouTube channel and make money on YouTube without AdSense1.License your content to the mediaSay you made a video and it went viral, you can offer to license it to the media such as tv news outlets, morning shows, online news site and even other creators. There are also marketplaces where you can list your content for purchase2.Affiliate MarketingAffiliate marketing is where you can earn a commission from another website for sending traffic to their site. The commission is generated through either a click or a purchase depending on the way that retailer has it set up. You can do a search and find most online retailers have it such as Walmart, Amazon, or even Etsy3.Sponsorship and brand dealsIt is a good idea to have a separate business email for your channel you never know when you may get contacted for a brand deal or sponsored video. Also, you can reach out to companies and say hey I am a youtuber and make these types of videos and think you product would be a great fit for my audience and see if they will send you some products or sponsor your video to center it around their products.4.Crowdfunding and donationsYou can add a PayPal link or use a platform to accept donations or get crowd funding from your viewers to help support your content creation.5.Marketing a business you already haveIf you already have an existing business you YouTube is a great way to market and transfer views into store visits6.Product salesYou can sell and market your own products directly on YouTube7.Website and Blog trafficIf people like your videos and you have a blog or website, let your viewers know about it and all those views can translate into traffic8.Teach online coursesIf you have a tutorial or teaching channel you can include some really valuable content that leaves your viewers wanting more and redirect them to paid online courses where they can purchase even more of you valuable content9.Rent Out your videosYou can offer to give shoutouts and links to other channels for a fee.Any or all of these methods are how to create a YouTube channel and make money Earning YouTube money is definitely easy. You just have to stay consistent, take your YouTube channel seriously, but still have fun doing it. And you will definitely see resultsWhen you are eligible to start earning from AdSense The first step is to enable monetization on your channel.

is there any way to get rid of gynecomastia	how can i get rid of man boobs	1	First of all, what are man boobs?Man boobs are essentially flabby pectorals. If they get bad enough it is tagged as a medical condition called Gynecomastia (often mistakenly spelled gynaecomastia or gynaecomastia). Gynecomastia is a condition that many men suffer from and it is very embarrassing because it makes your chest look more feminine than masculine. The extra fat around the chest area can look saggy and is very unattractive. Men that suffer from man boobs often feel like they are alone in that condition, but it is literally very common.Many men wish they could find a way to get rid of their man boobs, and many of them try. However, most of the men that try to get rid of their man boobs fail because, frankly, they are very difficult to get rid of unless you know the right methods and techniques.How to get rid of them?To put it very simply, the safest way to get rid of man boobs is diet and exercise. But this is a massive oversimplification. You can go on a diet, follow it religiously, lose weight, and still have man boobs. Man boobs will not disappear just because you stopped drinking soda, or have replaced fast food with salad. There are many kinds of fat, some even found in so-called healthy food, that target the chest area. You can be on a diet that works in general but is actually adding to your man boob problem.It is important to find a specific diet that targets man boobs because you have to avoid the foods that cause fat production in your chest, even if they are considered healthy overall.Why can't I just exercise a lot?Exercise helps burn fat, but different exercises target different areas. Running and walking can help you get in shape and increase your endurance and conditioning, but they will not do much to get rid of man boobs. This is very frustrating because you can run every day, drop many pounds, and still have those annoying and embarrassing man boobs.You will be able to bench press more weight and do more push ups but will not see a difference in your man boobs for a long time. There are some exercises that usually targets the pectorals and burns the fat even better and these include using a butterfly machine, or doing iron presses.What do I recommend?Man boobs are very stubborn so getting rid of them can seem impossible if you are not eating the right things, and doing the right exercises.You cannot go on a general diet, do general exercise, and hope to get rid of stubborn man boobs. You need to do specific exercises that work quickly and avoid the foods that compound the problem. It takes a combination of elements and tactics to get rid of man boobs quickly. When the right methods and processes are used together, getting rid of man boobs is possible.What specifically worked for me was following the Chest Coach System by Cliff Manchester and supplementing his program with the Gynexin Alpha Formula.	Are you sure it’s just fat? You may have a condition called gynecomastia. It’s a condition that boys deal with during puberty. And I know about it because I had it.The way you can know if you have gyno is if it feels like there is a hard lump of tissue right under the nipple.If there is a lump, and you’re a teenager still in the midst of puberty, it might go away on it’s own. If you’re in your late teens or early twenties, then you’re going to have to need to see a doctor about it.If it isn’t gynecomastia.Then you’re going to need to continue losing weight. Chest fat tends to be one of the more difficult places to drop fat.You have to consume fewer calories than your body needs to maintain it’s current body weight.How do you know how many calories to consume? Luckily, there are some great calculators out there → Calorie CalculatorNow you’ve got to actually count the calories. Here’s how:Here’s the 4 step process to counting calories:Buy yourself a food scale. (On each nutrition facts label, you’ll see calories and serving size near the top. The amount of calories listed is based on the serving size, which is why you need the scale).Every time you’re about to eat, look at the nutrition facts on the package of the food. (If there are no nutrition facts just google them).Weigh out a serving size (or multiple serving sizes) based on the nutrition label, and write down the amount of calories. If you consume more than one serving, multiple the amount of calories by the serving size you’re consuming. For example, if you eat 1.5 servings, multiple the amount of calories by 1.5.Do this for each food throughout the day. As you go, add up the amount of calories, but make sure you don’t go over the amount you got from the calculator.Everything in block quote taken from → Wilfredo Thomas's answer to How do I reduce body fat properly?

are there any scientific reasons behind hindu temples	what is the scientific reason behind visiting temples	1	"Scientific Reason :There are thousands of temples all over India in different size, shape and locations but not all of them are considered to be built the Vedic way. Generally, a temple should be located at a place where earth's magnetic wave path passes through densely. It can be in the outskirts of a town/village or city, or in middle of the dwelling place, or on a hilltop. The essence of visiting a temple is discussed here.Now, these temples are located strategically at a place where the positive energy is abundantly available from the magnetic and electric wave distributions of north/south pole thrust. The main idol is placed in the core center of the temple, known as ""*Garbhagriha*"" or *Moolasthanam*. In fact, the temple structure is built after the idol has been placed. This *Moolasthanam* is where earth’s magnetic waves are found to be maximum. We know that there are some copper plates, inscribed with Vedic scripts, buried beneath the Main Idol. What are they really? No, they are not God’s / priests’ flash cards when they forget the *shlokas*. The copper plate absorbs earth’s magnetic waves and radiates it to the surroundings. Thus a person regularly visiting a temple and walking clockwise around the Main Idol receives the beamed magnetic waves and his body absorbs it. This is a very slow process and a regular visit will let him absorb more of this positive energy. Scientifically, it is the positive energy that we all require to have a healthy life.Further, the Sanctum is closed on three sides. This increases the effect of all energies. The lamp that is lit radiates heat energy and also provides light inside the sanctum to the priests or *poojaris* performing the pooja. The ringing of the bells and the chanting of prayers takes a worshipper into trance, thus not letting his mind waver. When done in groups, this helps people forget personal problems for a while and relieve their stress. The fragrance from the flowers, the burning of camphor give out the chemical energy further aiding in a different good aura. The effect of all these energies is supplemented by the positive energy from the idol, the copper plates and utensils in the *Moolasthan*am / *Garbagraham*. *Theertham*, the “holy” water used during the pooja to wash the idol is notplain water cleaning the dust off an idol. It is a concoction of Cardamom,*Karpura* (Benzoin), zaffron / saffron, *Tulsi* (Holy Basil), Clove, etc...Washing the idol is to charge the water with the magnetic radiations thus increasing its medicinal values. Three spoons of this holy water is distributed to devotees. Again, this water is mainly a source of magneto-therapy. Besides, the clove essence protects one from tooth decay, the saffron & *Tulsi* leafs protects one from common cold and cough, cardamom and *Pachha Karpuram* (benzoin), act as mouth fresheners. It is proved that *Theertham* is a very good blood purifier, as it is highly energized. Hence it is given as *prasadam* to the devotees. This way, one can claim to remain healthy by regularly visiting the Temples. This is why our elders used to suggest us to offer prayers at the temple so that you will be cured of many ailments. They were not always superstitious. Yes, in a few cases they did go overboard when due to ignorance they hoped many serious diseases could be cured at temples by deities. When people go to a temple for the *Deepaaraadhana*, and when the doors open up, the positive energy gushes out onto the persons who are there. The water that is sprinkled onto the assemblages passes on the energy to all. This also explains why men are not allowed to wear shirts at a few temples and women are requested to wear more ornaments during temple visits. It is through these jewels (metal) that positive energy is absorbed by the women. Also, it is a practice to leave newly purchased jewels at an idol’s feet and then wear them with the idol’s blessings. This act is now justified after reading this article. This act of “seeking divine blessings” before using any new article, like books or pens or automobiles may have stemmed from this through mere observation.Energy lost in a day’s work is regained through a temple visit and one is refreshed slightly. The positive energy that is spread out in the entire temple and especially around where the main idol is placed, are simply absorbed by one's body and mind. Did you know, every Vaishnava(Vishnu devotees), “must” visit a Vishnu temple twice every day in their location. Our practices are NOT some hard and fast rules framed by 1 man and his followers or God’s words in somebody’s dreams. All the rituals, all the practices are, in reality, well researched, studied and scientifically backed thesis which form the ways of nature to lead a good healthy life.The scientific and research part of the practices are well camouflaged as “elder’s instructions” or “granny’s teaching’s” which should be obeyed as a mark of respect so as to once again, avoid stress to the mediocre brains."

is male circumcision required in islam	is circumcision allowed in islam	0	"Male circumcision - the Islamic ViewMale infants, worldwide, are circumcised for various social, religious and/or medical reasons.Generally, the ritual of circumcision is traced back to the time of the greatest of prophets Ibraheem (peace be upon him) when Allah commanded him to circumcise himself, his son Ishmael and all his male family members, and he followed Allah's order.Today Muslims are the largest religious nation to circumcise their male offspring. This ritual shows their belonging and closeness to their spiritual ancestor and the physical forefather, Prophet Ibraheem (peace be upon him).Because circumcision was also practised by all prophets, traditionally it has been in practice throughout the history among the followers of Prophet Ibraheem and establishes an Islamic connection to the ritual.Allah ordered the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) to follow the religion of Ibraheem (peace be upon him). Allah says in the Holy Qur'an:""Then We inspired you: 'Follow the religion of Ibraheem, the upright in Faith'."" [The Holy Qur'an 16:123]And an important part of the religion of Ibrahim is circumcision.The Prophet Ibraheem showed by his actions that he completely sumbitted himself to God's will, and encouraged his family and household members to obey Allah's commands without fail.The Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) said: ""The Prophet Ibrahim circumcised himself when he was eighty years old."" [Related by Al-Bukhari, Muslim & Ahmad]But unlike the Jewish tradition, in Islam circumcision is not a symbol of Allah's covenant with humans.​​​​​The Holy Qur'an does not impose an obligation on parents to circumcise their children, but the prophet Mohammed is reported to have stated that ""Circumcision is a sunnah(customary or traditional) for the men. Most references to male circumcision occur in the examples and traditions of the Prophet (peace be upon him). Therefore the scholars strongly recommend circumcision for male.From this point of view, traditionally, adult male converts to Islam are encouraged to undergo the operation.Furthermore, besides submission to the Will of God, male circumcision is an important ritual aimed at improving cleanliness. Therefore, in Arabic, circumcision is also known as tahara, meaning purification or cleanliness.Islam strongly emphasises cleanliness and purification both spiritual and physical. The mental and spiritual purification cleanses the heart while the social and physical purification cleanses the body as in circumcision. It also indicate that circumcised males are regarded as more pure (clean).Although circumcision is not one of the Five Pillars of the Faith, which consist of: the profession of faith, daily prayer, fasting at Ramadan, giving money to the poor (charity), and the pilgrimage to Mecca. However, this ritual is an act of purification and connects the person to the Prophet Ibraheem (peace be upon him) and his religion, Islam.The Qur'an says: ""Allah does not want to place burden on you. Rather, He wants to purify you and to complete His favours to you so that you may be grateful."" [The Holy Qur'an 5:7]The Hadith, the acts and the approvals of the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) together constitute the Sunnah. This is the second source of Islamic Law.God says in the Holy Qur'an: ""Verily in the Messenger of Allah you have a good example for anyone whose hope is in Allah and the Last Day, and who engages much in the praise of Allah.""[The Holy Qur'an 33:21]A Hadith related by Bukhari reads: ""The practices related to Fitrah (the nature) are five: circumcision, shaving the pubic hair, trimming the moustache, cutting the nails and removing the hair of the armpits.""Circumcision, throughout history, has been thought to provide a measure of protection against infections of the foreskin.In fact these are general practices that humans have..."	Of course.For males, circumcision is the cutting of the foreskin. This is the form practiced by the Prophet Abraham (ASWS). This is obligatory for them.For females, circumcision is also obligatory, and is the cutting of the Clitoris and preferably the Labia, though not all legitimate scholars agree on this. I would personally say that circumcision for women is cutting the Clitoris and the Labia Minora, while keeping the Labia Majora intact.Lately, there has been an attack on Islam, with western enemies fighting against female. and even male circumcision. This is a threat we must fight against.There are many advantages to female circumcision. Without the Clitoris (An organ with no important function), a woman is not only less likely to commit adultery and fornication, but also less likely to demand intimacy when the husband does not desire it. This makes marital life much more bearable. This is because of two main things:1- Without a clitoris, a woman has much less lust and sexual desires. If she does not desire sex, she will not annoy or nag her husband or commit fornication or adultery, thus saving her from a great punishment in both this life and the afterlife.2- Circumcision usually causes intercourse to be painful. As a result of this, a woman would refuse to commit adultery or fornication, and would not inconvenience her husband needlessly because of lust or desires.The movement to ban circumcision, part of the Fitrah, is a western secularist movement that is part of the plan of our enemies to destroy Islam. We must band together and fight this injustice with the assistance of the one true God.

One day, his father gave him a bag of nails and told him, ""Every time you get angry, hammer a nail into that front wall.""And so the activity started. On the first day, the boy hammered 50 nails. The next day, he hammered 40. Each time he used to go there, he repented being angry - it was quite a challenge to hammer a nail into that damn brick wall! Slowly, he discovered that controlling anger was easier than hammering, and the number of nails hammered started going down.Eventually, a day came when he didn't get angry, and he felt the joy of it. Now his father gave him another task, ""If you do not get angry the entire day, remove one nail from the wall."" After several days, all the nails were removed.Now his father took him near the wall and asked him what did he see. The boy replied that he can see holes in the wall. The father then explained to his son: ""These holes are like the scars that you leave on people when you get angry. No matter how many times you say sorry, the scar does not go.""So I suggest you two things:Realize that words once spoken cannot come back. Your anger hurts others and leaves a sour impression that lasts forever.Each time you get angry, ""hammer a nail"". Simplest thing you can do is to carry a pocket diary and put a line each time you get angry. Then at night, count the number of lines for that day. If you make this a habit, each time you would get angry, you would be reminded to note it down. Indirectly, you would also realize that you getting angry. And because you are conscious and aware at that time, you would find it easier to control your actions and subdue anger.I hope the day comes soon when you don't have any line in your diary."	Thanks for A2A, Anjali VinodOnce the thoughts originate the emotions it’s already there & at that very point of time if he/she can have an optimistic perspective to the situation it could easily be controlled to some extent. It is best to start with acting normal even in hard situation where one feels a cry is necessity.Yes people can regulate their exterior body language to some extent by choosing their locations. Hiding your emotions is the first step but the very next step is to act strong in front of the world like you don’t give a shit about it at all!As the famous saying goes “Fake it till you get it”.
what are genders	what is gender profiling	0	In my experience working in autism elementary school classes, I see several differences between boys and girl. I was at an autism unit yesterday where there were six students - 5 boys and 1 girl. That’s the “NORM” set-up as far as the number of boys and girls. I would be shocked to go into an autism unit that had more girls than boys. The teacher, the other aide, and myself spent far more time keeping an eye on each of the five boys than the girl. She was the only one who was verbal. I could easily see her moving into the general ed population but the others maybe but they have a longer road to get there. 1Girls with autism seem to behave in ways that are considered acceptable as opposed to boys. For example, girls appear to be passive, withdrawn, dependent on others, uninvolved, or even depressed (just as boys do). They may become passionately and even obsessively interested in very specific areas (just as boys do), but they may not gravitate toward the areas of technology or math.Girls with autism are less likely to behave aggressively and more likely to be passive or withdrawn. I know that personally since I will steer away from confrontation. It takes a lot before I’m backed into a corner and my aggressiveness sets in.Girls are more likely to choose interests (such as TV stars or music) that appear more typical than, for example, many boys' perseverative interests in schedules, statistics, or transportation. Again, I know that all too well. I was obsessed back in the day with soap opera characters and music stars.While boys' social communication issues become challenging very early in their lives, girls may be able to manage the social demands of early childhood but run into difficulties as they enter early adolescence. This was the way it was with me. I recall being socialable in 1st grade but by middle school I was more or less socially mute.Research suggests that autism may look quite different in girls—so different, in fact, that it can be difficult to diagnose. I couldn’t agree more as someone with autism and someone who works with fellow travelers on the spectrum.	I have two employees that usually leave work at 6 pm. They are good, but I don’t like that their commitment lasts for work hours only. What sh...

how long can raw and cooked sausage last refrigerated	how long does onigiri last if left refrigerated how can it be kept longer	0	"As a USDA inspected sausage manufacturer, the general rule that we suggest to our customers for our standard pork sausages (like a simple pork Italian sausage) is about 5-7 days for BOTH raw and cooked sausages. Please note: This is 5-7 days from the date of manufacture for pork sausages, or 5-7 days from the date of thawing the product if the pork sausage was frozen immediately after production. The USDA's ""Keep Food Safe! Food Safety Basics"" cold-storage suggestions suggests a more conservative estimate of 1-2 days for raw beef, chicken, pork, and turkey sausages, and this may be a better estimate when storing proteins other than pork, and also if you are unsure of when the product was manufactured, if you are unsure about whether or not the product was manufactured by a USDA inspected facility, and/or if your sausages have not been religiously stored according the the guideline I list below.It is possible they will last longer than this time-frame; however, there are so many things that can go into this equation that you are best staying on the safe side. Here are some things that can affect the shelf life:5-7 days from the date of manufacture is a conservative estimate, assuming that the product remains refrigerated below 40 Deg F. at all times. Shelf life is reduced every time a product’s temperature rises above that threshold, even just a few degrees.Preservatives and cures do matter. All sausages contain preservatives (even salt is a preservative), but pre-cooked sausages often contain cures (e.g., sodium nitrites) and/or anti-microbials (e.g., sodium lactate and sodium diacitate) that can significantly extend the shelf life of a product. There have even been experiments that have shown that adding anti-microbial salts like sodium lactate and sodium diacitate in a food can actually kill new bacteria that is introduced to a sausage after its production. Still, be cautious, and don’t eat anything that looks or smells bad.The ingredients and recipes matter, A LOT!! USDA requires wholesale sausage manufacturers to use sanitary ingredients in their production; however, local butchers or restaurants that make their own sausage are typically not USDA inspected facilities and are not held to these strict guidelines. That being said, while a facility like mine will produce a sausage that may last far longer than 7 days when refrigerated properly, the local butcher down the street who makes the same recipe but instead uses wet marinates or fresh fruits or vegetables in his/her recipe may last even less than 1-2 days because the bacteria from the marinate or the fresh fruits and vegetables will cause more rapid spoilage, and because simple sausage-making equipment can add excess heat from friction during the production process. Ask your local butcher about his/her use of fresh fruits and vegetables before you buy.Be conservative. Sausages freeze very well, so I would recommend keeping them frozen to be on the safe side. Also, purchasing sausages that are manufactured by from a USDA inspected sausage manufacturer (like my company) will typically be a safer bet. See How to Find the USDA Establishment (EST) Number on Food Packaging to learn how to identify the USDA mark of inspection on your preferred products."	Urine should be tested as soon as possible after collection, specifically within 2 hours. If it cannot be tested immediately, it should be refrigerated, but refrigeration should be limited to 6-8 hours. Decomposition of urine begins within 30 minutes of refrigeration, and the bacteria in unrefrigerated urine multiply exponentially, interfering with the accuracy of bacterial counts. Urine that is to be cultured for bacteria should be immediately refrigerated and kept refrigerated until cultured.For more information, see: Preserving routine urine specimens, documentation of normal flora, and quantitative body fluid counts

how does it feel to be a closeted gay in india	how does it feel to be homosexual in india	1	Well, I'm gay and Indian.In a nutshell, It's stifling to live in such an orthodox society where being yourself is a crime. Freedom is just an illusion here. You have people defending triple talaq and beef ban, but nobody comes out in the support for our basic human rights (Not any privilege).Gay word is used in bullying here, like its an abuse (You must have heard the phrase “Tu gay hai kya”). I have to constantly hide my sexuality and pretend that I'm straight, Which is big deal. It’s suffocationg when you really like someone and want to tell your friend or that person, but you have to strangle your feelings (something which gay people become pro in!) because It’s abnormal.I hail from a small town of UP. I've known my sexuality when I was in 12th. I never discussed it with anyone. Though having sex with boys or fucking boys is an act in which many guys are involved in India (especially rural India), but loving them is a different case here.And that's what I happen to do.Now, there are three things which really matters when you're different:1. Your loved ones. In India - most of the people have never seen homosexuals (including my parents) so there’s ignorance about homosexuality. That’s why telling them that you're homosexual is beyond the realm of imagination.2. Law. Which criminalize the homosexuals in India.3. Society, of India? enough said. Majority of people with topi and tilak would rather fight for their imaginary gods than for the rights of fellow human beings.Are you feeling something? Imagine what would you do had you been in the similar stifling life. I’ve wasted so much of my precious time worrying about this and my future, which resulted in poor academic performance and I ended up being somewhere I never wanted to be.However, It doesn’t make any sense for India to be this way. Why?Because I've been taught since my childhood that India is the largest democracy in world. Are these just words that we use to tap our back or do they really mean something to us? DEMOCRACY people!Because I've been taught that democracy is the rule of people, by the people for the people, while in reality, It’s the rule of majority, by the majority, for the majority. Not the minuscule minority. sigh!Because Indians need to justify each and everything by their ancient damn mythology and religions. Like this god also did that, this is mentioned in out book and so on! Why do I have to give a damn about that?Because politician here believe that rape is just a minor mistake by boys but homosexuality is against our culture(A hypothetical term used by hypocrites who have nothing else to defend).Because my loving Prime Minister choose to stay quiet about our rights while he can speak continuously on Hygiene in India, he can request a gay CEO (Tim cook) to invest in India and he can brag about human rights in the address to USA Congress.Because people here so petrified by family and society that its impossible for us to have someone like Harvey Milk or Ellen or Tim cook. I’ve even talked to gay people who say that they’re privileged as hell in this country and they don’t want to indulge into this agenda that we’re pursuing. Those hypocrites are happy in their cocoon and that’s why we’re seen as a minuscule minority.Currently, I'm in an engineering college, writing this answer, pretty fucked up with all the gay underground dating stuff, dreaming to move out of a country which denies to accept me.	"I am a closeted homosexual Indian male. The fact that I have written this answer anonymously itself shows what the current situation for sexual minorities in the country is. For some people, accepting their sexuality is difficult. Luckily for me, the whole process of acceptance was very smooth. Since I was a child, I always knew that I found the male body more attractive than that of a woman. I displayed slightly gender deviant behaviour when I was in school, and as is the norm in our society, I was made fun of. But that didn't bother me much because my parents loved me despite of that (and I hope they still do when I come out to them). I really started to understand about homosexuality when I got into college, but it never once crossed my mind that I could be gay. In my first year college, I was pretty insensitive to other people and passed a lot of homophobic comments, which I regret now. I guess I enjoyed not being the victim this time. In my second year, when I was reading an article about LGBT, it suddenly stuck me that I am the G in LGBT. I found a lot of stuff on the internet that helped me realise that it is nothing abnormal(Internet is the best thing that happened to homosexuals in India!). In my third year I came out to my best friend and my closest cousin. Luckily, they were extremely supportive. Then I discovered Grindr and PR. Through these apps, I met a couple of guys in my college. But these apps are full of lecherous and bigoted people. It is difficult to find good people here. This is my last year in college, and there is a lot of uncertainty about the future, because the situation in our country is not good for homosexuals. I plan on coming out to my family soon, but I am treading on a tight rope here. It is really hard living a two-faced life. I have dreamed of emigrating to another LGBT friendly country, where I will be accepted for who I am.Coming out is a difficult process, especially in India. There are many conservative and religious outfits who wield considerable power and are strictly against homosexuality.Another problem with the county is that there are millions of people who don't know the homosexuality exists. Of those who are aware of the fact of it's existence, a large number looks at it as an abomination. There are very few people who actually understand that being hetero-/homo-/bisexual is nothing but just one aspect of your personality, just like being tall or short or having brown eyes. It doesn't completely define a person. Homosexuality is still perceived by many as a western phenomenon which is ""corrupting"" Indian society.A common misconception is that homosexuals are a group of similar minded people and they tend to associate common characteristics to all of them. For example, not all gay men exhibit gender deviant behaviour, and not all men who exhibit gender deviant behaviour are gay/transgender. And also, it is important to understand that there is nothing wrong with not conforming with what society thinks how you should behave. There is also a need to dissociate homosexuals/bisexuals from transgenders and the ""Hijras"". In India, neither of these communities are treated with respect. They are seen as less than human, which is appalling for a country that boasts of its diversity and ""tolerance"".  If a man comes out as gay, he is called hijara or 'chakka' which is really bad for his self-esteem. This and other forms of discrimination, often lead to depression and suicides. People need to know the difference between the two, and need to respect people for who they are. To sum up, being homosexual(or any of LGBTIA) in India is a difficult struggle. But there is some hope, as some NGOs are constantly fighting for our cause. And we hope to see a change soon."
can we switch roles at amazon	how important is the role of tpm at amazon	0	"Former QA Manager from Amazon here. First, congratulations on your offer. Amazon is an awesome place to work.  Amazon has a pretty thorough interview process. Based on the discussion after interview, the hiring team decided to offer you the job. If they offered you a QA job though you applied for the SDET role, it means two things. First, the loop agrees that you are a good fit as a QAE. Second, the loop could not reach consensus on your fit for the SDET role. Note: This could just be lack of consensus or a consensus that you are not fit.> What quality assurance engineer do in amazon?I read some of the answers below about the QAE role. Most of them are wrong. In Amazon, QAEs spend quite a bit of their time coding. The engineers review code, write automation scripts and extend automation to cover new scenarios.> Can I switch roles?Yes, you can, but once you check out the QAE role, you may not want to. SDETs focus on building frameworks and focus on different problem sets. QAE offers a much more ""closer"" to the customer perspective. You get a lot of exposure to business activities. As a manager (of managers), I have seen QAEs switch over to SDETs, in one case to an SDE. My advice is to go in with the mindset of learning as much as you can and delivering as best as you can. Rather than focus on the title, focus on the kind of work you need to do. Folks who have walked in with ""I will come in and switch"" have almost always failed at their current role.> Will there be enough opportunities for a QA guy at amazon to grow/move to work as SDE/T?For sure, Though, Amazon off-late has been focusing on working on growing QAEs as QAEs (They don't have a lot of QAE IIIs or Principal QAEs). Amazon's org structure is quite flat, and managers do have quite a large playing room. If you do well, I don't see any reason why your manager will not leverage your skills. For example, last year, we had pretty big resource crunch in the development team. As a QA manager, I was able to offer up one of my QAEs to join the development team, albeit temporarily, to help. Even though, the QAE did a fantastic job in the development team, his passion was to go down the SDET path. He is now an SDET in the same team. > Will a QA guy at Amazon be considered if he applies for the role SDE/T through internal postings? Will the application be considered?Yes, I know of many cases where engineers have applied for a job posting different from their current titles. Please expect the interview process to be ""identical"" to that of an external hire. Internal interviews are generally lighter, but in such cross title cases, they may be just as rigorous. > Should I wait for six months and try again for SDE/T, with more preparations?Tough one, It really depends on what you want to do. More often than not, I think people are put off by the QAE title. The job, role and the nature of work you will do is fabulous. If (a) you like the work you will be doing, and (b) are comfortable with the compensation, I say go for it. PM me if you want to talk about this. For (a) you can ask the recruiter to put you in touch with the HM and they will gladly talk to you about what challenges they deal with on a daily basis.~Vivek"	Dislike from Microsoft or Google, Amazon doesnt seems to like hire PMs in general. Usually your group manager has a role of PM in someway. However, some groups do hire TPM. They are doing but not limit to: 1. Getting product requirements 2. Break up user stories and bugs in a tech way3. Keep track of the sprint cycle.
what happens if dictatorship is continuing in the present days	what happens if a dictatorship continues in the present day	1	My interest in answering this arose from seeing the very interesting term ‘Triple Squeeze’. This answer is an attempt to trace the Indian-Indonesian and the Pakistani-Indonesian relations. Let me answer it in a timeline oriented way.A good time to start would be the Indonesian National Revolution. Just like the British were our colonizers, Indonesia was colonized by the Dutch. The Indonesian National Revolution was an armed conflict and diplomatic struggle between Indonesia and the Dutch empire, and an internal social revolution. It took place between Indonesia's declaration of independence in 1945 and the Dutch recognition of Indonesia's independence at the end of 1949. Before all this happened, the Japanese invaded Indonesia in 1942 and the Dutch colonial rule was ended. By 1945, when the World War II came to an end, the Japanese had to surrender, but the Dutch were severely weakened in the WWII and were in no position to come back as a serious military force until early 1946.This paved the way for the two most important nationalist leaders Sukarno and Mohammad Hatta to form the Republic of Indonesia. Since the Dutch were still not strong enough to return, the Allies decided to place the archipelago under the jurisdiction of British Admiral Earl Louis Mountbatten, the Supreme Allied Commander, South East Asia Command (the Americans were concentrating on the Japanese home islands) and the British troops started arriving from the end of 1945. The Dutch started arriving from early 1946 onwards. This led to a bloody struggle between the Republic of Indonesia and the Dutch - British forces. After 4 years of struggle, though the Dutch won the war in military terms, Indonesia ended up gaining Independence. Sukarno was the new leader of Indonesia.One of the key reasons for the Indonesian political victory in the Indonesian National Revolution was a defection in the British Indian army. Muhammad Ali Jinnah (who was at that time President of the All-India Muslim League - India and Pakistan were still not Independent nations) encouraged Muslim soldiers serving in British Indian army to join hands with Indonesians against their fight against the Dutch Imperial colonisation of Indonesia. As a result, 600-Muslim soldiers of the British Indian Army deserted the colonial forces putting their lot at stake, allied with Indonesians. Out of these 600 soldiers, 500 of them died in war. This is considered as a precursor for Pakistani-Indonesian relations. Please note that Sukarno was the leader of Indonesia during this period.After India got her Independence, India and Indonesia formally commenced diplomatic relations in 1951. In 1955, India (Jawaharlal Nehru) and Indonesia (Sukarno) were one of the five founding members of the Non Aligned Movement. Diplomatic relations between India and Indonesia, at this point of time, were pretty strong.Proceed to 1963, and Indonesia is involved in a confrontation with Malaysia. The Indonesian–Malaysian confrontation was a violent conflict from 1963–66 that stemmed from Indonesia's opposition to the creation of Malaysia. Please note that Sukarno was still very much the leader of Indonesia during that period. Now what happened was that New Delhi supported Malaysia morally during this struggle. India and Indonesia were less supportive of each other’s broader regional ambitions. When Indonesia sought to achieve regional hegemony in Southeast Asia by scuttling the creation of an independent Malaya, India gave Malaya significant support in various international forums as well as advocating a continuing security role for Great Britain in the region.The rivalry between India and Indonesia during the early 1960s was aggravated by Indonesia’s increasing tilt toward communist China, including the perceived formation of a China-Indonesia-Pakistan axis hostile to India. Indonesian President Sukarno’s growing radicalism l...	Let me inject my little humble experience with the Nationalist military—no exactly answering your question, but may provide some insight to the Nationalist government’s downfall.The Nationalist government withdrew to Taiwan in 1949, telling its own people that it was a temporary tactical maneuver and that we would soon counter-attack and retake the homeland. I was brought up in such belief. In all honesty, that was the only belief around—or rather, allowed.In 1967, 18 years after the KMT-CCP civil war, like all my contemporaries at the time, I began my military service as a platoon leader in the Marine Corps right after college (sort of ROTC-like officer in the US). When I first reported to my company with much apprehension, I felt no welcome—or rather, I was made to feel like an outsider. Without saying a word, a master sergeant handed me my uniform and placed my civilian clothing in a bag. I noticed he never bothered to solute, as I was made extremely conscious that respecting rank was an utmost important way to keep the military discipline, regardless personal feelings toward the person who happens to out-rank you. I sort tried to understand how a fifty-some-year-old master sergeant would feel when he had to salute to a young kid thirty years his junior, but, again, I did not invent the rules.I was shown to my tiny officer quarter. The place was already occupied by another officer and he grudgingly cleared out the upper bunk bed for me to crawl in. I considered myself lucky: comparing it to the open double-deck sleeping arrangement during my boot-camp days, it is a private mansion.On the same evening, I saw my platoon the first time. An unhappy—very very unhappy indeed— old sergeant named Li who had acted as the substitute platoon leader rudely summoned the thirty-some skeptically looking young conscripts and reluctantly transferred his command to me. I knew even then from the looks of the young troopers that the old fellow Li would not give up his power without a fight. I kept my posture and introduced myself briefly to the troopers and told the sergeant to dismiss the squad and let the guys rest early. Soon after I turned my back I heard the old sergeant begin barking at the conscripts and kept rambling, shouting out a long tirade about discipline, honor, and duties, which I considered completely irrelevant. I was torn between stopping him from the nonsense volley for the sake of the troopers and keeping the protocol which gave him the prerogatives as a sergeant to bark on. I backed off from the direct confrontation with Li, not a pleasant first day in the service.No sooner did I report to duty than the company was given the order to march out with full gear, with the M2 for foot soldiers, a carbine for sergeants and the .45 caliber pistol for officers. I never shot a 45 pistol but it felt good, I had to admit. We were not told where to go, or what to do or what to expect. I overheard the soldiers mumbling that since no live ammunition was dispensed so that must be good, meaning at best just an exercise of some sort, unlike two years before when live ammunition was dispensed and with all communications with outside cut off did they all break out in tears, realizing something bad was going to happen. Fortunately, I was later told, the mission was scuttled as the first ships entering Xiamen Harbor was intercepted and the entire crew was captured.We marched for hours to get on a gigantic transport ship in ZhoYin. That was quite a sight to behold: hundred and hundred of us jammed on every single square inch on deck, and the loud growling landing ships (LTV) belched heavy diesel fumes rammed into the lower deck. Soon we set sail. It was a calm but queer night; overhead, the Milky Way easily fit into your hands as the transporter was kept intentionally in the pitch darkness. Soon its swaying motions started to its tolls on the...
what makes a great cup of coffee great	what makes a perfect cup of coffee	1	“Perfect”? No such thing, friend. What you might call a perfect cup might be another's “Meh”, and their “Meh” might be another's piss-water.But there are some general rules for making “Better-than-usual” coffee.There are three main components to coffee:I. BeansFor the love of God, leave the Folgers and the Nescafé on the shelf. They aren't going to help you here.Ideally, you'd get some locally-freshly-roasted beans that were imported from a single origin. But, we don't all live in a hipster's paradise. Some whole-beans from a local café, or even unflavoured beans from the supermarket will do just fine.For the record, instant coffee is dried compost. Don't bother.II. GrindHere's where we start to get pretentious.You've bought your beans - great! Now you need to grind them.Different coffees require different grinds. Espresso needs a fine grind. French pressed coffee needs a coarse. For drip coffees, you need something in the middle.Grinders vary from $10 to $1000. If you don't have $80 or so dollars burning a hole in your pocket, just get them ground at the café or grocery store you bought the coffee in. This will reduce the lifespan of the coffee*, so don't buy too much at a time.If you can afford it, don't get a grinder with metal blades. You want to grind the beans, not cut them. Look for “Conical Burr” grinders.*Ground coffee has more surface area. Coffee + O2 = oxidizes coffee = stale piss-water.III. MethodLet's assume we're talking about a normal cup of brew. The various different types of preparing coffee, from espresso to Turkish and back to lattés, are beyond the scope of this answer.For regular, or “drip” coffee, you have two common options:i. MachinesWe've all used these. You stick your ground coffee in a filter, you fill it with water, you press “On”, and 5–15 minutes later - voilà! You have coffee.The problem with these is that you have no control. Now, this isn't necessarily a bad thing - less human input means better consistency. A machine will produce a good coffee everytime.Obviously, don't cheap out on your machine. Spend as much as you think your quality of coffee is worth. $100 should be plenty for the regular consumer. Keurigs and Nespresso machines are for convenience, not quality.These will only ever be “Good”, though. If you want “Great++”, you'll have to do things manually.ii. Pour-Overs.Pour-over coffee is aptly named.You take the role of the machine, and you pour the water over your coffee.For this, you'll need a controlled stream of water. Good luck pouring a consistent amount of water out of a pan for 3–4 minutes. Goose-neck kettles are specifically designed for this purpose - you'll need one.You'll also need something to hold your filter - Haario V60s are the leading brand for filters and filter holders. These won't make much a difference for your coffee, there are just various aesthetic choices.Pour-over techniques are nuanced, easy to learn, difficult to master, and explained in posts much longer than this by those much more qualified than I. A quick Google search will yield hundreds of results.I will say this: your first Pour-over coffee will not be great. It likely won't be good. Nor will your dozen'th, but it will be better.But by your hundred'th, you'll be making coffee better than any machine will.Now that I've written what I'm sure has been writ hundreds of times, in hundreds of ways, I'd like to reiterate - no coffee you or I or anyone makes will be perfect. But you can get close.	"It is understanding the funamentals of the process and doing them properly.Start with Filtered water (water should not have a smell or taste).Clean brewing equipment.Proper grinding based on brew method.For the cup to be ""great"", the coffee should be specialty grade.Understand the variables within the process.  One example of an important variable is the ratio of water to the weight of ground coffee.  What makes ""great"" coffee varies from one person to the next.  It is important to understand the process conceptually so you can establish a baseline and then make the necessary adjustments so that you learn how to make what YOU think is great coffee.  All that matters is the finished product meets your expectation.  This is a conceptual approach vs. a coffee recipe approach (conceptual understanding is better than memorization)."

why has not  gayle laakmann mcdowellcareercup created a mooc or a coding bootcamp	is gayle laakmann mcdowell planning on publishing any more books if so what is she working on	0	Instagram ‘s CEO, Kevin Systrom, willgo down in history as one of thegreatest Silicon Valley success storiesof our generation. Unlike MarkZuckerberg, the man responsible foracquiring the popular photo sharingapp for $1 billion, Systrom receivedno formal engineering training.Systrom, an active user on Quora, isa largely self-taught programmer.While working in the marketingdepartment at Nextstop , whichFacebook acquired in 2010, he wouldspend his evenings learning toprogram. According to Systrom, smallprojects included combiningelements of Foursquare with MafiaWars.	I might one day, but I have no specific plans. If I were to write another book, I'd probably write from the other side: how different companies interview, the pro/cons of different interview process, etc. A lot of the consulting work I've done recently has focused on that side, and I think there would be a lot of value in a book like that.
what is fermentation what are some products of fermentation	what are some fermented products	0	The term fermentation has been derived from latin word ‘fever’ meaning ‘to boil’ because during fermentation a lot of froth is formed due to evolution of CO2 gas and it gives the appearance of boiling.The process of fermentation was discovered by Pasteur (1860) while Leibig and Buchner related this process with enzymes. Products obtain by fermentation depend upon the nature of enzyme.Decomposition of complex organic compounds into simpler substances by enzymes present in micro- organisms is called fermentation.Examples : putrefaction of food, souring of milk or curd and formation of vinegar.	Fermented foods, which are foods produced or preserved by the action of microorganisms. In this context, fermentation typically refers to the fermentation of sugar to alcohol using yeast, but other fermentation processes involve the use of bacteriaAlso known as cultured dairy foods, cultured dairy products, or cultured milk products, fermented milk products are dairy foods that have been fermented with lactic acid bacteria such as Lactobacillus, Lactococcus, and Leuconostoc. There are lots of fermented products are available in the market today. If you search it you can get a big list.
what do you think about my short film colorshift	what do you think about my short film	0	Great little film. Love to see creativity like this. I have few pointers to help you out.You need to have different shots. This is a must to break up the monotony of the film. The same shot, one after the other is hard to watch without wanting to fast forward. Most shots should be short as this is a short, but this also holds true for most filmmaking. Pick your favororite show or movie, the shots rarely go over 6 seconds, in fact more often they are much shorter (2 to 4 seconds),unless establishing some sort of dramatic tension, establishing a location or setting up blocking for multiple characters or events.Lets use your film as an example. The final repair scene for the ColorShift takes roughly 40 seconds without a single camera angle change. You could break this up with a mid shot of you putting the laptop away and opening the unit, cut to, Closeup of your hands working, cut to, your face in some sort of determined look, and back to the closeup of the repair. After the repair is complete you could go back to a mid shot of you in black and white, hit the button and voila, color again with a satisfied look on you face. End it there, no need to return the package, jut walk off screen and flicker the color.Establish the location of the building with a wide angle establishing shot, (it doesn’t even have to be your actual building, no one will ever know). Show us where the action is going to take place. Establish the room you are sitting in. Staggering the type of shots from wide or mid to closeups will draw more attention when the closeups are used and will make them more powerful and much more effective.Instead of the same static shot changing color take stills or 2 second long shots of the actual world outside your door and color shift the color on those images, it adds a more personal feel and creates more value for your film. The static long shot changing for ten seconds seems mechanical and impersonal.That all having been said, I hope you understand this was meant to be constructive. I really enjoyed your film. Great work, great concept, great story. Keep making films, you really have something there. Hope this helps.Take care,Jim	Great little film. Love to see creativity like this.

should there be a war between india and pakistan for kashmir	why is there a conflict between india and pakistan on kashmir	0	I think they should first be more serious about what their country's people actually need and want, and considering the loss of any valuable life, take any steps that would prevent such a possibility. The governments should think more by putting themselves in the shoes of others and use greater diplomacy in their affairs.!!	RECENT HISTORY OF KASHMIRThe problem was ‘created’! In 1947 when Pakistan was carved out of India on the basis of ‘Two Nation Theory’, the Muslim majority areas were to go to Pakistan eg. East Bengal and West Punjab, and the other areas of present day Pakistan, and Hindu majority areas were to be part of India. However, there was a problem. There were over 500 princely states which had the right to remain independent. It was left to the rulers to decide if they wanted to merge with India or Pakistan or become a free state. There were some rulers who wanted to merge with Pakistan like the states of Hyderabad and Junagadh which had Hindu majority but the rulers were Muslims, while there were states like Kalat (present day Baluchistan) which wanted to be part of India, but they were coerced or forced to join the Unions.Jammu & Kashmir was also such a state. It can be divided into three parts. The areas in and around Jammu, the majority was Hindu, in Ladakh, the majority are still Buddhists while the valley of Kashmir has Muslim majority. For Maharaja Hari Singh it was a dilemma whether he should be joining India or Pakistan. So, for the time being he decided to remain independent, on the basis of ‘Standstill Agreement’ which was drafted by the British Government of India in June 1947, which prevented any hostile military intervention by the soon to be created dominions of India and Pakistan. This agreement was signed by all the rulers (princely states) and the signatories of Indian and Pakistani Dominions.Though Maharaja Hari Singh was averse to signing the accession treaty with India, the Pakistan establishment of the time planned an armed take-over of Kashmir. In September 1947, a large army (consisting of mainly Kabailies - tribals, along with army men dressed in civilian clothes invaded Kashmir. There were mass killings of mainly minorities - read Hindus and Sikhs, over 6000 rapes according to UN records, loot and plunder of the region. The Maharaja of Kashmir sought help from India but the Nehru Government refused to intervene initially. Lord Louis Mountbatten, the First Governor General of India advised Maharaja Hari Singh to sign the accession treaty to India. The Maharaja escaped from srinagar,t he Capitol and flew to Jammu, where on October 28th, 1947, he signed the treaty of accession to India. As the accession treaty was being flown to Delhi, Indian army was being flown in to protect Srinagar mainly. Ethically, morally and legally, India was now defending its own territory. Brigadier Usman led the Sikh Regiment in a counter-offensive and drove the infiltrators out of the area and were chasing them out of J&K when an order arrived from the Centre that the assault should stop. Pandit Nehru in his honesty or naivity wanted this issue to be sorted out by the United Nations. He made a blunder by giving a radio speech on All India Radio where he declared that there would be a ‘Plebiscite’ held in Kashmir to determine which way the Kashmiris want to go.The UNSC passed a resolution # 47 on Kashmir on April 21, 1948. It had three parts -In brief…1) Pakistan would withdraw all its civilian and army men including the tribesmen from the entire region of J&K, including the occupied areas of Pakistan Occupied Kashmir (POK). Following this,2) India would withdraw all its forces except a token army presence in Srinagar to defend the city.When this is done to the satisfaction of the UNSC observers, then…3) A plebiscite was to held in J&K (all areas including POK).Watch this video for a wonderful response on Jammu & Kashmir, by Christine Fair, a South-Asian expert, and Associate Professor, Georgetown University.To this day Pakistan has not carried out its obligation to fulfill the first part of the resolution. UNSC has consistently stated that India and Pakistan must adhere to the said resolution. However, many invading tribesmen settl...

The federal rules on food stamps for students are somewhat complicated.A “student” is someone who is between 18 and49 who is attending an institution of higher education and is taking at least 6 units, or is at least half time according to the school. The person has to be in a program of higher education; students who are taking, for instance, English as a second Language (ESL) classes or GED classes are not considered students of higher education.In general, a student does not qualify for food stamps, even if that student is extremely poor. This goes back to the Reagan administration. If you recall that time, you may recall the “welfare queen”, a black woman who drove a Cadillac and used food stmps to buy thick steaks. That is no more true now than it was then—nothing but a cruel myth. But that’s how all this was portrayed. I also recall students were castigated because Uncle Sam was allowing them to receive an education and food?! Regular people can’t do that. Why would liberal lazy students qualify? So in 1981 the Food Stamp Program suffered massive cuts, and most students were cut off.However, some students do qualify. Here are some of the ways:Under or over agephysically or mentally disabledsingle parent of a child under 12 and child care is not availableparent of a child under 6 (if a 2-parent household, only one parent qualifies)working at least 20 hours a week on average earning at least minimum wagereceiving TANF and participating in the work programparticipating in state or federal work studyThe Food Stamp Program, now known as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), has been arguably the single most effective federal program, along with Social Security. The USDA provided a documentary many years ago on the benefits of food stamps. In the film, a doctor is treating a severely malnourished baby, who dies while the camera is filming. In some areas, babies and children no longer die from malnutrition. Elderly now have the ability to get additional food.Yes, there are many problems with the program, but the good far, far outweighs the bad. And this is the program targeted for even more cuts that will affect only affect the poorest of the poor.The federal regulations on student eligibility can be found at 7CFR 273.5.
what are some real world example of encapsulation and abstraction and how are they different yet related	what are some examples of recursion in the real world	0	TechnicallyAbstraction : Abstraction is the act of representing essential information without including background details and explanations.Encapsulation : Encapsulation is the act of wrapping up of attributes(represented by data members) and operations (represented by functions) under one single unit (represented by class).Taking Real world exampleSuppose you go to an automatic cola vending machine and request for a cola. The machine processes your request and gives the cola.Here automatic cola vending machine is a class. It contains both data i.e. Cola can and operations i.e. service mechanism and they are wrapped/integrated under a single unit Cola Vending Machine. This is called Encapsulation.You need not know how the machine is working. This is called Abstraction.You can interact with cola can only through service mechanism. You cannot access the details about internal data like how much cans it contains, mechanism etc. This is Data Hiding.You cannot pick the can directly. You request for cola through proper instructions and request mechanism (i.e. by paying amount and filling request) and get that cola only through specified channel. This is message passing.The working and data is hidden from you. This is possible because that Vending machine is made (or Encapsulated or integrated) so. Thus, we can say Encapsulation is a way to implement Abstraction.	By recursion, I'm assuming that you're referring to the computer science term[1]. Recursion in computer science is a method where the solution to a problem depends on solutions to smaller instances of the same problem as opposed to iteration[2] which is simply the repetition of a block of statements within a computer program. Many other answers refer to iteration instead of recursion. For instance, looping a video in VLC player can be considered an infinite loop which is simply an iteration that does not terminate.To implement a recursive algorithm, the problem must satisfy the following conditions:It can be broken down into a simpler version of the same problemIt has one or more base cases whose values are knownMy favorite real world example is this one:Let's pretend that you're seated in the last row of a large, packed classroom.Now, for some inexplicable reason, you want to know the number of rows in the room. You're too lazy to count so you ask Mike who is seated in front of you to tell you how many rows are there in front of him. Mike does the same thing and asks Patil who is seated in front of him and so on till Alice who is seated first row is asked the question. Alice can answer Jack seated in the second row because she can see that there are no more rows in front of her. This is the base case. Jack adds 1 to Alice's answer and tells it to Jill who is in the third row and so on until the answer reaches you. Notice that at each step the problem is reduced to a simpler version of the same problem.[1] Recursion (computer science)[2] Iteration

what is the best accordion for beginners to learn on	how difficult would it be to learn how to play the accordion if i know how to play the piano	0	"I actually have a different opinion than Larry on this than Larry.  I have liquidated an accordion shop. One of my closest friends in the world was Walter Kuhr who owned the wonderful Main Squeeze Accordions on the lower east side in NYC.    When he passed away, I had to learn a lot about accordions to take care of the closing of the store, so I did.Also through Walter, I learned a LOT about buying accordions.  Let me tell you, it's easy to buy shit. There are a few questions before anyone can give you a good answer.1.) Do you know how to play piano?If so, you've got a head start and I'd say you could definitely start with a 24 bass or even a 48 bass.  If not, you want to look into 12 bass and 24 bass only.It also helps when it comes to buying an accordion.2.) What kind of music do you want to play?You can play a wide variety of music on a piano accordion, but if you want to play Irish button or Cajun -- don't waste your time on a piano accordion only to have to learn a completely new instrument.  Cajun accordions and Irish button are a WORLD of difference.3.) How serious are you?  In other words, if you just want to see how you like it, then I'd actually suggest you just rent one for a week. (depending on where you live, I guess.)But if you know that you want to learn this thing and you'll stick with it a few years, then spend some more money, and definitely get 24 bass.4.) Where do you live?I'll get to why this is important a little later.         ABOUT BUYING ACCORDIONS.Point #1I'm going to say this once, and I'm going to be borderline offensive about it.If you buy your first accordion off Ebay, you've either got shit for brains.   I don't know how else to say it.People selling accordions cheap on Ebay usually are along the lines of ""Found this in my uncle's attic.  Seems to work perfectly.  Has a full keyboard.  $200 plus shipping.""Congratulations.  You just bought yourself a really expensive doorstop.Here's why.I know they're built like air conditioners, but believe it or not, accordions don't age well when they're left on their own.Inside the accordion are three fragile things:  wax/glue, leather strips,  and steel strips.  Lots and lots of steel strips.And when the accordion is stored in an attic or anywhere that's not the correct temperature three things happen.   The wax glue crumbles, the leather curls and the steel rusts.And that, my friend, is expensive to fix.  But if you don't fix it, it's like playing a piano that's been thrown out of tune.  You can't fix it yourself.  You have to hire a pro.Point #2And the above is why it's great if you have played piano before -- because then you can test out the scales.  Play every scale.  The entire circle of fifths.   Then ask the person to play the bass side scales if you're not able to.If you don't know all the scales, see if you can get your hands on an electronic tuner, or a buddy that plays music.Point #3See it in person.   Don't have it shipped to you.   That's why ""where do you live"" is important.  If you live in a remote area, you might not have a lot of accordionists around you.But shipping an accordion is a hideous thing.  You need to dissemble it and have the reeds wrapped separately.   If it's small like a student hohner then it doesn't need to be dissembled, but it does still need to be shipped correctly or the thing WILL, and I mean WILL be damaged in transit.So try to get your hands on the instrument before you buy it.  And if you get it in a shop, you'll know it's properly tuned.And Larry's advice about smelling the accordion for must and bellow leaks.  Always bad signs.On to the accordions...STUDENT HOHNERThe absolute, positive go-to student accordion is the student hohner and if you can  get this one cheap, you should hop on it: student hohner  (sorry, sold mine.)These are German made (mostly-- there are some made in China I've heard.)  These will last.  They're like the Volvos of accordions.   Importantly, when it comes time to sell the accordion, you will probably sell it for what you paid for it.   They're everlasting.CHINESE ACCORDIONSI would definitely buy a new low-end Chinese accordion than buy a used piece of shit.  "	Well, it depends upon what kind of accordion you are seeking to learn.This?Or this?You see, the answer is not as simple as it seems.The keyboard accordion with chord buttons on the back side of the bellows would be the easier of the two to learn, but still will be a challenge.The button accordion, the second image, will be far more involved, even difficult, to learn to play well.While the first accordion has keys, you still have to train your left hand, the button pushing hand, to function properly - which means that nothing from the piano will work for that hand at all. So it is fresh and new, unfamiliar. But you’ll be playing tunes sooner.The second accordion will be a wholly different instrument to learn to play, all buttons. So very little, if anything physically, will translate from the piano. It will take a bit before you sound like you know what you’re doing.Then there is the physical activity of working the bellows - all while playing the instrument. The bellows is the soul of the accordion. Work it wrong, and you sound like a bad piper. Work it well, and magic ensues…. after you get everything else reasonably figured out.So, how challenging do you want to make the process?
role of junior leaders in indian army	what is the role of the indian army	0	The Chief said that the Army is not yet ready for the role of women in combat arms.All those who propagate this thought, must spend some time in a forward Post and experience the life of a soldier. It is not a ceremonial job or law and order police job. The jawans will only accept you as a leader, when you are physically better than them, can bear all the hardships of life in isolation, be away from family for years, stay alone (as an officer) on a post or patrol with the jawans, be able to handle all types of situations, be able to deal with a drunk or frustrated or a depressed soldier.One should not expect a Lady officer to match a jawan, in physical strength or endurance. In the Army, an officer is always under test, by the jawans. To earn the unstinting respect and obedience of the jawans, in battle, you have to be better than him, in all parameters. You have to be a father figure, a guide and a trustworthy acceptable leader. After all, the soldier has to trust his life in your hands.Lady Officers have served with me in various Units/HQs. They were all very sincere, competent and good. They perform all the duties, including attending PT, Games and Parades. But, it was all in peace stations and in logistic units.In our culture and environment it will take a long time for the jawans to accept a women leader, in battle. Even in the US Army one keeps hearing of cases of unruly behavior, against women combatants.There are a lot of problems faced by both the Lady officers and the Units, in Field Areas, on Exercises, Out Posts, Night guard checking, Field Firing, Out Station duties, Patrolling etc. I can list many issues, which we faced for the safety of the Lady officers, when away on Exercises or during Operation, even in logistic unit.As a junior officer,I remember dealing with soldiers running amuck, insubordination, disobedience, sleeping on duty, intoxicated in barrack, gambling etc. As an only officer, who stays with them on the Post, you have to handle the situation at that time. It is a 24*7*12 job. There are no advisers or police or Human Right activists to fall back up on.My answer is, my question - would you like to send your own daughter to such a job ? Not me, as a soldier, who has seen life in the Army for 35 yrs and being CO of some of the Lady Officers, whom I always appreciated.Therefore, Lady Officers have not been inducted into Combat role. Let us utilise the Lady officers on jobs most suited to them and not politicise or genderise, them to pseudo fantasies of some activists, who have never left their AC offices.It’s strange, we ask special seats for women in buses and trains, special reservation in jobs, special police stations,even special auto-rickshaws, but want them to join combat arms ? All because those who propagate this idea will never go or send their daughters, to the combat arm of the Army. This is firing the gun from others shoulder and claiming the medal for themselves.	"Very Disciplined ! I think Indian Army have come a long way. They are among the best armies, undoubtedly. They are well organised, If you want to see discipline at its best in India, have a look at Indian Army.  The procedure to do things is quite good, they excel at management.  While most of the answers here, will definitely focus on war stories, courage and all of that, what intrigues me the most is day to day life of army personnels. So here comes  in the form of little  details my view of the Indian Army. I am answering this on basis of what I have seen of Indian Army as a Army Brat.The way Cantonment  areas are maintained is the most impressive thing about Army as per me. Cleanliness and greenery are like a part of the Indian Army. No matter which part of city it is, Cantonment areas have their own shine. No matter how filthy  a space there is, you give it for settlement to Indian Army, its face will change. Trees will be planted, litter will be cleared, through united efforts.  I have seen recruits working hard all day, just to clear the grass. I have nothing but respect and awe for how things happen inside army and how environment and cleanliness occupy an integral part in this sector.You can see hoardings  stating messages like ""save trees and wildlife"" and not to create litter or pluck flowers everywhere. The silent, peaceful roads with trees lush green either side, all painted with the  familiar  saffron  at the bottom trunk. This kind of unmatched management is appreciative. Many time, the thought crosses mind, that other institutions should use this approach as a model and work similarly.Its not just the place they live, I think Indian Army have this power to transform a person in something very different. I have grown up seeing people from villages who once knew nothing, struggle in their recruitment period and grow each day, get raises/ promotion and soon one can see  visible difference in their personality. Yes ! Be it the officer level entry or regular entries, lives are changed  and for good.I think Indian Army offers the best and secure job, which is easily & without corruption in reach of people from distant towns and villages, with marginal study levels. All they need is to qualify one run of their life : And then hardwork and persistence during training  :And a lot is changed in some years, they can afford  good education and health for their family.  Army personnels are so  much concerned about their dresses. Most of the time they expect the same   level  from their kids too. I remember my Dad would make me and my brother polish our shoes for like half and hour, "" Putting lot of that polish won't help,  brushing them will make they shine"" he would instruct ! The way they cover their writing registers. While I was in school, my notebooks were not that well covered. Some had covers on them some did not however my fathers notebooks on the other hand were  first well covered with chart papers, then there was, this another layer of neatly done plastic sheet over it. Self designed nameplates used to  go on top.  The alphabets on outer cover were written using font-helper. His notes , very neat, written with multiple colour pens. Trust me, the sincerity of written work surpasses, anything you have seen from  that topper girl  from  school time who writes all those notes with diagram. And this is not just my father, all JCO/ANO/NAYK/HAV category  army men I have seen do work like this.Something our school / college/ corporate cant make our boys do, the army does. (No, this is random  pic from internet. Dad's note were much much neat )From top of the rank, to bottom till recruit, I have interacted with most and I have seen one thing :  the command is what everyone stick here by! No mistakes !! Mistakes are not forgiven easily. Punishment will always be there. This is the Army. As far as I have seen solidarity, r..."
what  your opinion about the decision on removal of 500 and 1000 rupees currency notes	what is the use of demonetizing rs 500  and  rs 1000 notes	1	Withdrawing high denomination currency notes [demonetization] has been done before [1946, 1978]. However, I believe the present move [2016] might have a bigger impact than the one done by British India and Morarji Desai. This is a move I have been dreaming for years and glad that it was done.The fact that the government was able to do this so secretly in such a connected manner speaks volumes. Indira Gandhi tried this in early 1970s, but could not as the move leaked out and the bad guys quickly changed over the notes. The government had to back out of the move then. I’m even thinking if the move to ban NDTV was just a ploy to distract the whole media, to pull this off. And it was possibly scheduled on US election day likely to get the global media off the heat and attention, as foreign media has been ultracritical & condescending of any major move in India.There are 5 key incentives for this:Bringing out illicit money sloshed stashed in the parallel economyHaving a lid on the fake money racket supported by our western neighborIncentivizing India to go cashless. The banks would not hand you wads of the new cash, but will just credit the money to your bank account in place of your old currency.Moving the notes to a more secure standard - with better protection against counterfeiting.Curbing inflation in real estate and reducing gold imports.As the 6th incentive, it would impact coalitions ahead of the major elections in UP and Punjab. It is not shocking that elections, especially in these states with multidimensional politics [a lot of parties fighting] involve a lot of illicit money. MLAs get traded like horses - with suitcases of cash. Some of that trading will get impacted.Unlike in the past, I don’t see much impact on normal users of currency. The transactions that happen on Rs. 500 and Rs. 1000 should be moving to netbanking/cheque/cards anyway. If someone is still holding out against modern transaction methods, this is the opportunity to come out from under the rock.For the poor who don’t have debit/credit cards, there might not be much impact either - as most of their transaction happen under Rs. 500.Impact of the move1. Black Money & corruption: The impact on black money usage will be temporary as those would eventually move to the new Rs. 2000 notes in time. Also, a lot of the black money lies in real estate, gold and other physical things. Still even a temporary, small impact on this sector is better than nothing. The mere fear of government taking out your black money is good enough. That the government could so secretly do this will increase the fear.2. Elections: Especially with the major elections barely weeks away, the move would impact politics in the crucial states. My guess is that the government waited for the Diwali to pass [will be a huge pain for many to have this move before the festival] and do it reasonably before the elections [EC could throw a spanner on any major move just before the elections]. Thus, unlike the previous occasions, the government didn’t do this on January 16. It could have impact on corruption in those elections and it is a way of the government saying, “Maha Gathbandhan, Check”.3. Counterfeiting: The impact on the counterfeit notes would be more significant. Many “dealers” with the existing counterfeit notes would be stuck as they would have to take the notes to the bank and have better chances of getting their racket exposed. Thus, they are more likely to destroy their notes and incur losses. Losses to the bad guys is good and maybe some of them could get shot unable to pay their debts. It would be quite hard to counterfeit the new currency and until they develop the technology for that, there will be an impact on counterfeit notes and terrorism that is funded through that.4. Cashless society. All of the above things are temporary things. But, I believe the long lasting one could be in moving cashless. The pain of transferring cash could incentivize many to think about going bits and plastic. Today could be a day to introspect for the legal users of the currency. That could have a more significant impact on counterfeiting and unaccounted money.5. Gold/silver. In the short term, gold and silver buying will be hampered, as a lot of the buyers buy with their black money. That means less importing. Over the long term, there might be more purchase of gold as the black money guys will be afraid to hold too much cash.6. Real Estate. In the short term, prices of real estate would come down for the same reason above. There will be less suitcases moving. It is not clear what would happen to this sector in the long term. Maybe there could be a little more land buying, but that could be neutralized by the spiraling down of the prices that could go now.7. Markets. This is overall a positive move that is lauded by a lot of people and could bring more confidence in Indian markets by overseas investors. However, the exit of black money temporarily could cause other repercussions in buying. I would not be surprised if the market goes a bit down in the short and medium term.8. Overseas Indians. There is a lot of INR that gets transacted outside of India. Technically it is illegal [NRIs, foreigners can’t leave with rupee], but there are not many practical alternatives. They would be impacted as they cannot change the money to the new notes quickly and those overseas currency trading markets on rupee would be impacted [UAE money exchanges won’t accept notes in India recall]. Some of these transactions are good ones that improve the economy, while others might help Dawood bhai like ones.9. Banking to all. The government’s key objective is to bring banking to all and this will help that. If you have more than Rs. 4000, the bank will not give you new notes, but will just ask you to open an account and credit it there. This when followed with the fees on ATM transactions will make it harder to transact on cash.10. Consumption and economy. This is one thing I believe it is going to be negative. Black money drives a lot of the economy and now that it is gone, it will impact consumption levels. There could be a deflation and damp economic growth for a couple of quarters. In the long run it doesn’t matter though.Think about this. India’s total tangible wealth is of the order of 280 lakh crores. World bank estimates at least a quarter of this is black. That means 70 lakh crores. It is possible that 10% of it is in cash, with the rest in real estate and gold. That is 7 lakh crores of black cash that is lying around. Maybe 80% of it will turn white and even with that Rs 1.4 lakh crores of black will be gone. That is big.The government gave the black money holders enough time [until Sept 30] to come clean [Black money: Rs. 65,250 crore disclosed under Income Declaration Scheme] and following up on its warnings would make them take the government seriously in this aspect.On the whole, the government has announced that it is alive and bold. At a time it looked like the government was sagging and losing speed, it is a time to reinvigorate.	What do you think of the decision by the Indian Government to demonetize 500 and 1000 rupee notes? Do you think it will it help in curbing black money and corruption?
what are some of the most mindblowing facts about bengaluru	what are some interesting facts about bengaluru	1	"1.

if both the parents have blood group b can the child have a	if both my parents have blood group b can i be a	0	Ramananda sai Chilukuri has already discussed about how a child can have A blood group despite both parents having B blood group. Note that in 'A+'  is not a single but a combination of two factors i.e. the A from ABO blood group system and '+'  from Rh factor. As already pointed out,a child can have a different blood group owing to Chimerism https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/...In most cases though, a child may not have  A blood group if both parents have B blood group. How blood group may be determined can be found by drawing a Punnett square following Mendelian genetics. https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/...There can be four cases. Case 1.Father- genotype BO Mother genotype BOResults of offsprings:-25% BB  Phenotype- Blood group B50% BO  Phenotype- Blood group B25% OO  Phenotype- Blood group OCase 2. Father- Genotype BBMother- Genotype BOResults of offsprings:-50% BB  Phenotype- Blood group B50% BO  Phenotype- Blood group BCase 3.Father- Genotype BOMother- Genotype BBResults for offsprings:-Same as that of Case 2Case 4.Father- Genotype BBMother- Genotype BBResults for offsprings:-100% BB  Phenotype- Blood group BIn all the three cases we find that either the blood group will be B or O. The Rh factor is a representative of the presence or absence of certain antigen proteins, specifically antigen D. The presence of D antigen on the RBC membrane is considered as Rh positive(+) and the absence is considered as Rh negative (-). You can find more information about its inheritance and nomenclature from the following article. https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/...So in most cases  an offspring will not have A+ blood group if both the parents have B+ blood group.	Unfortunately, no.Blood type is determined based on antigens present on red blood cells. The most widely known blood type system is the ABO blood group system (think blood types A, B, AB, and O).These antigens are expressed through the ABO gene. The ABO locus (a term to describe a gene's position on a chromosome) contains one of three alleles: A, B, or O.Every person inherits one allele from each parent, which gives rise to one of six possible genotypes (AO, AA, BO, BB, AB, and OO) and four possible phenotypes (A, B, AB, and O):*Image source: The ABO blood groupIf both of your parents have blood type B, then they must both express either genotype BO or BB. This would lead you to express genotypes BO, BB, or OO, which means your blood type must be B or O.The (+) after the blood type letter signifies the Rh factor, which denotes whether the D antigen is present (+) or not present (-) on the red blood cells.Based on the possible genotypes for RhD expression, if both of your parents are Rh positive, you can either be Rh positive or Rh negative. Similarly, if one parent is Rh positive and the other Rh negative, you can become either Rh positive or Rh negative. However, if both parents are Rh negative, you will be Rh negative as well.This is due to the RhD gene being dominant, meaning it only needs to be inherited from one parent to be expressed. Therefore, both parents must completely lack RhD expression to be Rh negative, meaning there is no possibility passing it onward.Sources:The ABO blood grouptransfusion.com.auRh blood group system - WikipediaThe Rh blood group

what is the essence of enlightenment	what is enlightenment	0	Thank you for the A2A.The essence of something, is its most authentic state of being.  That thing may express in a variety of ways.  Each of those ways may tempt one to interpret those expressions AS its truest essence.  However, in most cases, this is not the truth, as appearances are born of the expression of this capacity towards multiple expressions, and the perceptual variance of human minds to interpret meaning INTO those things on its own terms.As human beings we are an expression of a more Authentic Self.  That authentic self expresses in a variety of ways through the human lenses of each human self.  Just as a beam of light creates multiple colors through differing color gels, so does the more Authentic Self express as a beam of light through all that we outpicture in our minds, hearts, bodies and life.  It lights a show of ever changing definitions and purposes.Since this expression of being human must have a sense of identity because it doesn't remember its Authentic Self, we have something called the Ego.  This Ego serves to pose challenges to our ability to remember our Authentic self.  We think as the Ego instructs:  that we are separate individuals, that the appearances in this world are the truth, that we are limited, and that pain and struggle is a natural part of our beings. To the Ego, distortions ARE the authentic nature of things.  This creates our confrontation with a powerful teacher at every turn.  One that denies our Authentic self in order to strengthen our capacity to realize it.The Ego desires that you self define via what you experience.  Within that beautiful crystalline radiance that enlivens the colors is the Consciousness of love, joy, fearlessness, freedom, peace and creative largess.  That Cosmic Consciousness IS that light, and that which enlivens the gels of this creation.  Our journey here then, upon this world called earth which is for us each a school, is to awaken within ourselves the awareness of the nature and being of our AUTHENTIC self.  It is to arrive at the point in which one has the expanse of awareness to admit new possibility concerning self and reality.This journey is the essence of spirituality.  Spirit as that beam of light flowing through distortions that challenge us to see its purity.  The colors intoxicate and we long to identify with them, even though they bring pain and sorrow ultimately.  That longing and the experiencing of the nature of the colors and how they define us as 'the truth', is what is called the human dream.  We dance upon the periphery of reality, creating a placeholder for reality out of our own definitions of truth.  Our destiny in this expansive universe, and the will of that pure Consciousness is to awaken from that dream and experience the joy and cherished unity with that Consciousness that is our AUTHENTIC SELF.Since that light gives capability to those colors, that light, in its purest essence is now within us now.  We need go nowhere to find it, as were it not within us, neither would be the colors of our existence.   Our journey then, is to go within, and not into the world of colors to find the answer.   It is to realize the  power to awaken the ability through focus and intention, longing and love.  It is to distinguish the pure light from the colors and to realize that the most Authentic expression of all that shines into this world, is that magnificent Consciousness that cannot be defined by any color it enables.  A mound of golden jewelry:  chains, watches, bracelets, pins, necklaces, rings, etc, is a mound of things that have a truer authentic essence.  That would be the gold.  Not one of those things defines the gold, only its own purpose.  The forms express in ways that entice us to see them as THE reality.  They are passing forms dancing upon ONE authentic thing.We begin to seek.  Eventually that authentic truth within, adhering to the expansive nature of the universe, quickens, creating forms of discomfort with how we are seeing life and ourselves.  We eventually set out to  energetically awaken tools within that make this journey of awakening victorious.  We set 'OUT'  upon a journey of freedom from a painful dream, by focusing 'Within'.  The pain we feel in this dream, in its most authentic essence, is believed separation from our source expressing in a million different scenarios and experiences as provided by the many colors of the dream gels.That is the essence of spirituality.   One begins, in their own time, to awaken from the human dream, prompted by their authentic essence, which acts upon universal will that we are unleashed like a galaxy of stars to claim the beauty and ancient wisdom of divine Consciousness with nothing standing in the way.	Here are the things you can do.1.Meditate every day. Twice a day is better. Three times is pretty awesome. Meditate as much as you feel comfortable and then a little bit more.Meditation is important for 2 reasons. One is to begin to free your attention from being identified with thinking. You learn to become a witness to your thoughts, or absorbed in the consciousness/energy/formless being that is transcendent of thoughts or to be absorbed in the silence where there are no thoughts at all.The second reason is to build up the subtle energy known as Shakti in your body, opening and clearing the energy channels of your body so that the Shakti can increase within you, flow easily and begin to rise up through the various chakras of your body.2. Treat your body well. Eat very light and healthy moving towards fresh fruits and vegetables and plant based proteins. Moving away from heavy foods, junk foods, sugar etc. What you put into your body has a huge impact on your awareness and the movement of Shakti in your body. At the same time, eat what is healthy for you. Don’t make yourself sick going rawfood vegan if you are used to eating hamburgers. Just move towards eating lighter and healthier.Make sure you get exercise every day. Anything that gets your body moving and your breathing heavy. This is very important to help move the energy. A nice walk in nature every day can be very beneficial too.3. Treat your mind well also. Be conscious of what you are putting into it as it will have an effect on your meditation. The movies you watch, the music you listen to, what you see on social media etc.4. Do other spiritual practices. Prana exercises can be very helpful in clearing the energy channels of your body and awakening and moving Shakti. Very important. A simple one is inhale through your nose counting to 4, exhale out your nose counting to 8. So you are exhaling twice as long as the inhale. Do this for 10 minutes or so before meditation every day.Chanting can be helpful. Japa (Silent repetition of a Divine name, Guru or mantra) is very powerful. Don’t let you mind just be lost in random thoughts. Begin to focus with Japa or self inquiry.5. Get lots of Shakti. Shakti is the energy of enlightenment that is transmitted by enlightened teachers. I offer music that transmits Shakti here if you are interested Deep Meditation Music Proven to Awaken You into BlissI also offer free Online Shakti Transmission Meditations with me if I resonate with you. Sign up to the weekly meditation teaching in the link above and it will notify you of upcoming sessions.That is just what I offer but you can find enlighteneds teacher that you resonate with, that you feel their presence meditating you, awakening you. Look on youtube if you like. Find one where you feel something happening sitting with them. Just because they say nice things does not mean they are enlightened. Find one or two whose presence meditates you, that you feel peaceful or blissful sitting with. This is the Shakti and it is very helpful in awakening you into enlightenment.6. Read books by enlightened teachers or the Upanishads or Dharmmapada etc. Don’t over read but read a little every day so that your mind becomes focused on enlightenment. Too much will just give you too much knowledge that will get in the way of enlightenment so just a little, digest a little every day. Experience and practice is far more important than understanding. But a little reading can be helpful.7. Start to move your attention into being humble, present, kind, soft. Bow your head figuratively. This humility opens you into awakening. But it is something that will happen naturally as you deepen in awareness. Arrogance is a big obstacle so be aware of that.8. If you do everything above, things inside you will get stirred up, there will be challenges. So surrender to what is. Learn to surrender to what is and allow the energy to heal you, nourish you, dissolve your ego.These are the things you can do. Beyond this, you have to let awakening happen. You do not do awakening. Awakening happens through grace. Doing everything above creates an environment for awakening to take place. But surrender and allow awakening to happen.Hope this helps.

how should i answer if an interviewer asks me to sell a pen or any other product as i am pursuing a mba	what should be the answer if your interviewer asks you to sell his pen in front of him	0	"Any who's seen Martin Scorsese’s - ""The Wolf of Wall Street"", featuring Leonardo DiCaprio as the infamous stock-broker and salesman, Jordan Belfort, contains a classic ""Sell me this pen"" sales lesson scenario. In the movie, DiCaprio’s Belfort teaches his sales team their first lesson by pulling out a pen and saying, “sell me this pen.” One character takes the pen and asks Jordan to write his name in a napkin. Jordan doesn’t have anything to write with and has to ask for a pen. Boom. He made the sale.Here the Strategy - Creating an Urgency made the sale.But, the truth is - This strategy hardly works for remaining salesLet's consider the same scenario and try selling it a better way with - Insight Selling. Insights gives a better decision making power for both Buyer and Seller Which in turn helps in having a win-win situation.With Insights selling:Seller can have the better knowledge about the problem (pain) areas.Buyer can have the information about the solution seller is having to solve his problem and can help them in building customer-centric productsNow, let's get back to selling the pen: Couple of questions the seller should have in mind.If buyer is not having a pen earlier - What can be the reason for not having a pen? -1. No AwarenessBring out the consultant* in YOU. Educate your buyer with the necessary knowledge of how your Pen (Product) is going to help you buyer and solve his problem.* - Well a sales person is not just sales person - He is a Customer Relationship Manager, Researcher, Consultant, Educator, Mentor, Value Creator, Brand maker - In short a jack of all)2. Not interestedKnew the answer of Why? As an user he/she might have been an exception or a myth. Now take this powerful tool to penetrate your product.3. Bad experienceUnderstand if it's with Pen or Pen seller (Product or the brand). Just don't stop here. Understand how your product is different from other market players - Keep a SWOT Analysis or USP's.Did the buyer is having a pen earlier? -Knowing this answer can be done with the better knowledge of your prospect (or) lead. You need to have insights of your customer very clearly. Definition's : HereIf buyer is having a pen earlier - How many pens he/she is using and changed till date?This answer helps you in understanding the exact pain area's about your Buyer and see how your product is best fit into the scenario.How important is a pen to your buyer?This differentiates the serious buyer and normal buyers. The Strategy of Urgency works hereHow your pen is different from his existing pen?List of qualities/functionalists (specific to product - Pen here) which are unique, Out of box and create's a difference.What are the value-propositions you're offering?Your value-proposition's can be comparision with different products in the market, the swot analysis with different brands make sense. The best value-proposition can be Seamless support by all the possible means by taking an extra mile and Offer something which they can't deny. (The Godfather's principle of Selling)This post make sense for the Entrepreneur who make customer-centric product which came out as a solution from a problem (pain) not for people who just consider their company as money making machine.**Entrepreneur - a person who is a game changer and they don't make great things - they make small things with great love. They're here not just to earn money - But to make people's life easier - Not easiest ;)A small suggestion to managers/recruiters who recruit sales people by asking this question to Sell you a pen - There are 2 sides of this coin (question). The above speaks about one side of it. But, the other side is - Selling remains same across the industries and products - But, the approach, perspective, volume of targeted customers, your product potential, the problem it's solving and other factors will make the major difference in Selling. So don't judge sales people just with this question.Now - Replace the pen with your product/Service & Let's Start Selling.Spartans.....what's your profession? - Let's Hustle with resultsApologies for grammatical mistakes if any.

I was wrong. It will happen to you too. And to avoid panic, you should know exactly what to say back.I am going to give you the right sales framework to respond perfectly every time.On a quick side note, did you know this sales interview question has been around for millions of years? Its origins date back to the earliest of cavemen. Selling slingshots cave-to-cave. Except back then, they asked, “sell me this bowl of crushed berries.”Anyways. The point is, one day it will happen to you and I want you to be prepared.Because if you start to describe how smooth the pen feels and how shiny the pen looks, just like you saw in the Wolf of Wallstreet…You probably won’t get the job.Why it matters to sell me this penAt first, I didn’t realize why it mattered. It just seemed like a silly question. But, you’ll see.When you become good at answering this question, you actually become one hell of a salesperson.And that’s why people still ask it in interviews. It shows your creative approach and how good you are at actually selling product (not just reading your resume).There are exactly four sales skills the interviewer is looking to see when you answer:how you gather informationhow you respond to informationhow you deliver informationand how you ask for something (closing)Now, since I had a lot of sales interviews lined up at the beginning of last year. I thought, I better practice my response just in case.The “just wing it” strategy is best for making pancake mix, not for sales interviews.So let’s go through exactly what you can say to address each sales skill. Because when you do it right, you will blow their mind!Here’s exactly what you can sayJust to back up for a second, I had 26 sales interviews in a period of three months. Someone was bound to ask me.Ok. The Director of Sales stood up and said, “it was great meeting you Ian. Let me go grab the CEO to come in next.” Moments later, the CEO of the 30 person startup walked in the small conference room.Shortly after initial greetings, the CEO wasted no time to start the interview.I practiced my answer beforehand. I made sure my answer displayed the four sales skills the CEO needed to hear.Now you can read it for yourself. And then use it for yourself.At the bottom, you can see a simple sales framework to memorize that will make this work for you in any situation.You can memorize the script, but more importantly, memorize the sales framework at the end.Here you go…CEO: Do me a favor, sell me this pen. (reaches across to hand me the pen)Me: (I slowly roll the pen between my index and thumb fingers.) When was the last time you used a pen?CEO: This morning.Me: Do you remember what kind of pen that was?CEO: No.Me: Do you remember why you were using it to write?CEO: Yes. Signing a few new customer contracts.Me: Well I’d say that’s the best use for a pen (we have a subtle laugh).Wouldn’t you say signing those new customer contracts is an important event for the business? (nods head) Then shouldn’t it be treated like one. What I mean by that is, here you are signing new customer contracts, an important and memorable event. All while using a very unmemorable pen.We grew up, our entire lives, using cheap BIC pens because they get the job done for grocery lists and directions. But we never gave it much thought to learn what’s best for more important events.This is the pen for more important events. This is the tool you use to get deals done. Think of it as a symbol for taking your company to the next level. Because when you begin using the right tool, you are in a more productive state of mind, and you begin to sign more new customer contracts.Actually. You know what? Just this week I shipped ten new boxes of these pens to Elon Musk’s office.Unfortunately, this is my last pen today (reach across to hand pen back to CEO). So, I suggest you get this one. Try it out. If you’re not happy with it, I will personally come back next week to pick it up. And it won’t cost you a dime.What do you say?CEO: (picks jaw up off floor) Yes.See how simple that was. The CEO loved it. Why?Because all four sales skills were displayed.Here’s the simple sales framework I used to answer “sell me this pen”. Memorize it for yourself.Find out how they last used a pen (gather info)Emphasize the importance of the activity they last used a pen (respond to info)Sell something bigger than a pen, like a state of mind (deliver info)Ask for the buy (closing)Does that make sense? Yes. Ok, good.ConclusionRemember, it’s not about actually selling a pen. It’s about showing how well you can sell a product.And even though there are an infinite number of answers to this interview question, it’s easy to memorize a simple formula.Now that you have a formula, next time you need a quick, go-to answer, remember the Senator Club formula.Take 15 minutes today to practice the script above. I promise you will benefit.
how much is the maximum gold you can take when flying from india to usa	why do not  we fly east to go from india to usa	0	For the USA, there is a requirement that if you are carrying more that $10,000 in cash or negotiable instruments, you must declare it when entering or leaving the country -- but it's perfectly legal and there is no limit. Gold is not currency or a negotiable instrument unless it is in gold coins from the USA or another country.   There is also no duty on importing gold.  So, with the exception of gold coins that are legal tender somewhere, there is not only no limit on how much may be imported or exported, you might not even have to file a special form -- but if over your duty-free limit, you do have to declare the gold on entry on the standard customs form.  Nothing is required on exit.The USA is only one country.  Other countries certainly may have different rules.	Why is it hard for people around the world to understand that the USA is not trying to dictate things but, rather fighting for world peace, freedom, security and stability?
if my reservation status is rac does it mean the seat has been confirmed	my family tickets have changed from rac to cnf confirmed will all of us have adjacent seats after preparation of charts	0	RAC- Reservation Against CancellationIf your status is RAC then it means you will get a seat in sharing with someone. Mostly person get side lower berths in case of RAC. In case of garibrath you a lower and middle seat is shared among three persons. Most of the times RAC seat will get confirmed on journey itself.This scheme is one of the smartest way of increasing revenue. Generally some passenger couldn't come at the last minute and RAC passengers ensure extra revenue. However having fixed quota of RAC is not a good thing. They should follow some forecasting model based on the journey date, route and seasonalty.Edit 1: I never expected this to me my most viewed answer. Anyways happy to help clearing your doubts.	The railway reservation system works as follows:Tickets are issued in CNF category until they are exhausted. Further RAC and WL tickets are issued. For RAC and WL tickets your ticket show two RAC or WL numbers. The first is the overall serial number and the other the status at time of booking. If someone cancels a ticket booked ahead of you your RAC or WL tickets move up. If sufficient CNF tickets are submitted for cancellation, the passengers in your ticket get CNF gradually or at one go.Reservation closes some three hours prior to scheduled departure of the train at originating station. Reservation charts are prepared soon after closing of reservation but after allotment of EQ. Seat allotment for RAC and WL tickets initially and later confirmed is made only during chart preparation. So it is immaterial when the individual passenger(s) in a PNR gets confirmation of a seat.The system first finalizes the status of the ticket and allots seats to CNF category. To the possible extent the system allots tickets in same coach and coupe. If not feasible the seats may be issued at various locations. It all depends on the location of cancelled tickets.
how does a new website protect its design and user interface from copycats	what is a way to design a beautiful user interface	0	"The design, UI, and even UX of a site embody a host of different forms of intellectual property (i.e. copyrights, patents, and trade secrets), and each require different types of protection. I'll keep this fairly general and high level.Copyrights - Things such as your site's content (whether it's images, sounds, written material, etc), your code (both source and object), and any other documents you have on the site are all protectable under copyright law.  You automatically own the copyright of any original expression of an idea in a fixed, tangible format (i.e. once you ""put pen to paper""). Nothing else needs to be done for you to own this copyright, though it's not a bad idea to put a ""©"" on your site to put the public on notice of your copyright on the materials. You can also register your copyright with the U.S. Copyright office -- this is completely voluntary and not required, though it does provide you with some benefits, especially if a dispute arises down the road.Patents - Ignoring mine or anyone else's personal feelings on software patents, the current system allows for them and you might as well play within the system. First, you have two kinds of patents to consider: Design, which covers a product's (in this case a website) appearance, and Utility, which covers any new and useful idea embodied in your website -- generally, things your website does. Design patents are cheaper to get, but also provide substantially less protection. If you feel like you have a super unique UI (think iOS UI or Google's homepage, both of which have design patent protection), you can consider filing for a design patent.  On the plus side, design patents are substantially cheaper to get than utility patents, and for some folks, there's something to be said about having granted patents in their portfolio. That said, the downside is that design patents are relatively easy to get around. More likely, you'll be concerned with utility patent protection.  This protects something unique that your website does (or will do) -- the minimum threshold is that the function is new (never been done) and useful (does it have some use?).  I also say ""or will do"" because, unlike copyrights, you can patent your idea without having created a tangible form of it.  If you believe your site does or will do something unique and groundbreaking, it's not a bad idea to consult a patent attorney about whether you can patent it. If you have serious financial constraints (i.e. most early stage companies), you can consider filing for a provisional patent application -- which gives you a one-year ""placeholder"" for you to decide whether you can/should file the utility patent application.  A provisional is much cheaper to file than a utility application -- just understand that if you don't file a utility application within one year of the date on which you filed a provisional, the provisional goes away and you're back at square one.  As for costs associated with the process of getting a utility patent application granted by the U.S. Patent Office, there are a number of factors that affect cost, but it can get into the five-figure range (when adding in all Patent Office fees, attorney fees, other various fees).Just be aware of one additional thing re: patents -- once you've shown  an idea to the public or offered a product up for sale, you have exactly  one year from the first day you publicized that idea to file either a  provisional or utility patent application.  After that, it's considered  free for anyone to use.  Your one-year clock may already be ticking.Trade Secrets - Trade secrets are your company's ""secret sauce."" The underlying reason for having a patent system is to incentivize the sharing of innovations (after all, almost all innovations are built on some existing innovation). So with patents, the U.S. government grants you a 20 year period during which you can exclude others from using your idea, but you only get that exclusivity in exchange for your sharing your idea with the world (via a patent application).  If you think your idea will be relevant for a long time (think Coca Cola formula, Google's search algorithm), you should consider not filing for a patent at all and taking precautions to prevent disclosure of your trade secret.All this said, if you're a startup company with a great idea for a site, building the best possible site and getting a ton of users should always be your primary objective. I can't stress this enough. Don't spend too much of your time on IP protection. Consulting with a patent attorney is a good, prudent first step -- they can generally give you advice on all aspects of intellectual property protection and steer you in the right direction."

how can i improve my skills	how do i improve my learning skills	0	"You have asked, ""Why is C++ Hard?"" Learning programming from the top down can make C++ harder to learn. Familiarity with languages such as Python, JavaScript, Visual Basic, Java, C#, and Ruby on Rails can give you an incomplete picture of software development. When those languages and others like them are your only introduction to writing code, C++ will be hard.C++ is not in the same class. C++ is unique and special, like C. That uniqueness, that special nature makes it harder to pick up and apply.Easy and QuickThe main purpose of Python, JavaScript, Visual Basic, Java, C#, Ruby and languages like them is to do one thing. Save the programmer time writing code and create an end result with as less fuss and difficulty as possible. A working program done fast is more important in those languages than a rigorous software development process. You can add structure, but the core of those languages is such that additional structure is optional.Many languages are designed, on purpose, to be easy and quick.The pinnacle, and state-of-the-art of C++ programming is the total opposite of this:The purpose of C++ is much different.The ChameleonPeople hesitate to say about C++ that it is a chameleon language. A chameleon is a type of reptile whose entire skin is designed to match the thing it is on. The animal mascot for C and C++ should be the chameleon. The reason is the main purpose of those languages is to match the machine they run on.This is C++ relative to most other languages.Complexity of a ChameleonWhen people look at chameleons, we think they are so awesome as a concept. How can a creature in nature just change their skin like that, blend in, and be one with nature so much as to evade destruction? We cannot understand it, because that is not how people's bodies work. A chameleon is complicated from the outside. However, to a chameleon, how they are is simple to them. They know exactly (or at least automatic instinct) to change form, sit motionless, and be the thing their skin is emulating.C++ as a ChameleonLike the chameleon, C++ matches the computer. That includes the hardware and the operating system. This morphing doesn't happen automatically. Shaping the code to be that way, has to occur on purpose. You are writing code in C++ that is balanced to both the machine and your intended operational process at the same time. The other languages only emphasize that second part so when you meet C++ for the first time, there is an entire realm of possibly unfamiliar technology concepts that throws you off.Making Matters WorseWorking with C++, you see this chameleon nature but may not understand it. Things get more difficult when you try to ignore it and apply C++ in the same way as other languages. If you do pure C++ 14 and C++ 17, you can get closer except the C++ standards bodies are moving away from the way people code today. Next generation C++ is going to be even more foreign because it is state-of-the-art. Regardless of today or tomorrow, the missing element that makes C++ hard is when you decide to ignore machine architecture.Machine ArchitectureI respect the advice of experts but will say no, you cannot just learn C++ 14 or C++ 17 as the next thing to replace Java, C#, and Ruby on Rails. You will have to commit yourself to knowledge of machine architecture and how that relates to concepts such as pointers in C and C++, memory management, and so on. Otherwise, you end up with mysterious situations that challenge you and your ability to revise code and manage it. Compilers will then constantly give you feedback that amounts to endless rejection.C++ is really about the machine and whatever real-world idea you would encode.Functions and FlexibilityC++ is not an object-oriented programming language. The inventor of C++ has hinted at that for years. The hint is ignored. Unfortunately, not even the inventor of C++ can get people to rea..."	It all boils down to understanding.Study habits, the surrounding environment, and all other efforts can be fully maximized if the understanding part is well established.This applies to learning almost anything, and not just limited to academics; it extends to learning a skill, language, topic, or even a game.I had a tuition teacher with a humble-sized group of students who taught Maths and Chemistry. I’ve always scored an “E” or “F” for both.“I just have no chemistry with Chemistry” have been my tagline.After just 2 months of tuition, my grades went up significantly. I got a “B” and “C” for my preliminary exams for Chemistry and Maths respectively.I remember his words pertaining to how to tackle what I had trouble learning with.“Always look at them in chunks, and break them down in smaller chunks till you get its atomic representation. And then study that till you’ve mastered it with thorough understanding. Piece all the chunks back together. You’ve got yourself a solved Rubik’s Cube.”That’s his analogy. And it works every time.Look at every word/terminology that you don’t understand, and/or you think you understand. Study everything revolving that word/terminology. If you skip a word or two, it could prove to be detrimental and may backfire as it contributes to your lack of understanding. That one word could have been the ultimate ingredient in piecing the last of the big puzzle.For example, if the first sentence in a Chemistry textbook under the topic: Ions wrote, “An ion is an atom or molecule that has a non-zero net electrical charge (its total number of electrons is not equal to its total number of protons),” does that effectively explain ions to the student? For instance, in that sentence there are words such as, “atom”, “molecule”, “electrical charge”, “electrons”, “protons.” Does the student already know those terms beforehand, fully? Or will further research and study of those words be more helpful? Once those terms have been fully understood, that sentence will then make a lot more sense.“Mere memorization and speed-learning are two of the most effective methods of providing the illusion that you truly understand something, when in actual fact, you have not really. That’s not how mastering works.”Though, as he pointed out, which many agree, is that mastering and truly understanding something comes at a huge cost of time. Though, it is also highly rewarding, especially when you’re going to create things within your pursuits.‘Understanding is not a stage you’ll clear once done, it is always activated as you dive deeper into your area(s) of study. It only serves as a more smooth and efficient way for you to move forward and progress as you probe deeper and deeper into the layers of your area of study. You never really stop understanding.”The ability to learn (better) = The ability to understand (better).
is it possible to use spi between avr and raspberry pi	what are the uses of raspberry pi and intel galileo	0	NO. Raspberry Pi is insufficient considering the current difficulty level. Yeah the Pi is cheap, but do the calculations and see…easy to Bing or Google…what is the difficulty level and what is your energy consumption.I have 10 GPU miners (6 GPUs per miner) and am earning close to $10000 a month. That has returned my initial investment in just 6 months and now it is pure profit…until I need to upgrade to the latest GPUs.SO, DO THE MATH. How much does it cost, what is the hashrate (which determines how much you earn), what is the electricity cost, and figure out how long it takes to make your initial investment back. Then you can calculate ROI (return on investment). Good luck and well wishes for you.	Disclaimer: I have not used the Galileo.The Raspberry Pi is a Linux computer on a small board with limited IO to the physical world whereas the Arduino, and the Galileo looks to be an Arduino on steroids, is made primarily for physical computing. The primary limits on uses are that of the user or developers imagination. There are libraries of applications for each. Both types are meant mostly for students, hobbyists, quick prototyping, and the like, but there is nothing stopping someone from using either in a commercial product. Why you don't see this all the time is because of the economics of scale. If you need more that around 25 of something it is cheaper to build the functions into a custom PCB. If someone came to me and wanted me to make five of something and I thought I could do it I would certainly consider using the above boards.
which are the best movies of 2016	what is your best 2016 movie	1	"The best movie according to critics is Moonlight. It is then followed by La La Land and Manchester by the Sea for second and third.Topping out the top 6 are Hell or High Water, Arrival, and Toni Erdmann. The remaining top 10 are O.J.: Made in America, The Handmaiden, Jackie, Elle.[update: late September 2017]I completed watching the top 25 in September. So few of these movies received any distribution or notability. I felt that the top two movies by critics (Moonlight and La La Land) were good, but very Hollywood-y and not really to my taste — high quality, but not my favorites. My top movies are of 2017 are:Excellent (9/10)#1 Arrival (critics: #4)#2 I Am Not Your Negro (critics #25)#3 Manchester by the Sea (critics #3)Great (8/10)#4 Hell or High Water (critics #4)#5 Hunt For the Wilderpeople (critics #36)#6 Captain Fantastic (critics #40)#7 Moana (critics #48)I’ve really enjoyed watching the top 25 and encourage people to do it if they enjoy cinema.The full list of year’s movies are:1. Moonlight Effective #1.1 (IMDB)A young man deals with his dysfunctional home life and comes of age in Miami during the ""War on Drugs"" era. The story of his struggle to find himself is told across three defining chapters in his life as he experiences the ecstasy, pain, and beauty of falling in love while grappling with his own sexuality.My opinion: This movie has great supporting roles which were really the highlight of the movie. I found that the three different eras had such different feelings, issues, and vibes that it more felt like three short films rather than one coherent movie. You do get a three dimensional picture of the main character, but I personally didn’t find him that compelling — aloof and distant would be the words I would use to describe him. My rating 6/10.2. La La Land Effective #1.8 (IMDB)A jazz pianist falls for an aspiring actress in Los Angeles.My opinion: Except for the Academy, apparently, I’m the only person that didn’t adore this movie. I found it alright. I love the cinematography, particularly the use of color. I don’t get much out of the dancing and find that it takes away from my enjoyment of films (this is personal preference). I didn’t particularly like the characters and the story was pretty derivative. So this is expertly made, but not made for me. 5/10.3. Manchester by the Sea Effective #2.1 (IMDB)An uncle is forced to take care of his teenage nephew after the boy's father dies.My opinion: This movie is heart rending. The acting is spectacular. I have two main issues. The first is that Lee’s character doesn’t really take an arc. This makes the film see like its treading water. This is realisitic, but ultimately makes it seem unfulfilling at some level. It could have been a shot at the end showing some appreciation, or some level of catharsis. The second thing I didn’t love was the cinematography, which felt a bit cheap. Some of the shots were done with bad conditions. There was a lack of clarity in some of the shots and a general feeling that the film looked digital. Small quibbles, but it left me with a final score of 9/10.4. Arrival Effective: #4.4 (IMDB)Linguistics professor Louise Banks (Amy Adams) leads an elite team of investigators when gigantic spaceships touch down in 12 locations around the world. As nations teeter on the verge of global war, Banks and her crew must race against time to find a way to communicate with the extraterrestrial visitors. Hoping to unravel the mystery, she takes a chance that could threaten her life and quite possibly all of mankind.My opinion: This is one of the best science fiction movies of all time. It has unique takes on the characters involved with an alien encounter. The use of time is something that I haven’t seen in a movie before. 9/105.

what would be effect of 500 and 1000 rs notes ban	why central govt banned old 500 and 1000 rs note but issued new 500 and 2000 rs note	1	What do you think of the decision by the Indian Government to demonetize 500 and 1000 rupee notes? Do you think it will it help in curbing black money and corruption?	I think it’s important to understand some basics about black money before judging this giant decision by the government.When we hear ‘Black money’ what most of us imagine is this:And conclude that this is ‘evil’ or ‘bad’ and hence must be cleaned up. And that is all there is to ‘Black money’.The truth is this hoard of cash might be completely legitimate, even if it hidden under a bed - if it has been disclosed to the government and taxes have been paid for it. Then it is white moneyMoney = Cash?I might store all my money(black or white) in bank deposits, or in the form of cash at home - if that makes me happy. I might use it for charitable purposes or to throw a booze party or for a lavish wedding. That’s my right.Money can take the form of cash, real estate, gold or whatever.The only question which makes it black or white is: Have the requisite taxes been paid?If taxes are not paid, then it becomes black money. Now I need to hide this money. Surely bank deposits are not a good idea! If I buy something using this money I need to hide that too. So I buy big things in somebody else’s name(benami transactions), stash it in offshore accounts(which promise secrecy), invest in real estate(by showing lesser value) etc.Note that the cash component is a small part of the total money - especially If I have huge amounts of black money. It is simply impractical to hoard it all in cash.So ‘money’ is NOT the same as CashSo when we say our stated aim is ‘To curb black money’ we are not just hunting for hoards of cash. We are not even hunting for people with lots of real estate, or politicians who have a lot of gold. People can legitimately hold on to all that.We are hunting for hoards of cash, or people with lots of real estate, or politicians who have a lot of gold - who have not paid the taxes on it. And then collect those taxes. And perhaps impose heave penalties to prevent recurrence.But even this catches existing black money. The real solution is to make everybody pay taxes. But maybe catching existing black cash is also a good first step…So let’s analyse how useful this step is.Coming to demonetisation, two things to understand:It directly affects only the cash component of money. Not the real estate, gold etc. that I have. And that too, the part that is in form of 500 or 1000 notes.It affects black and white cash. You and me had white money but still were forced to deposit it in banks.So to judge effectiveness of the demonetisation scheme, we should try to calculate how much of the money is in CASH, and is black, and will be collected - and compare it against the total black money.A - Domestic black money“As Schneider estimates, using the dynamic multiple-indicators multiple-causes method and by currency demand method, that the size of India's black money economy is between 23 and 26%”Source: Indian black money - WikipediaLet us assume it is 25%“The Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in India was worth 2073.54 billion US dollars in 2015”Source: India GDPThis translates to 141 Lakh crores. 25% of this is about 35 Lakh crores.B - Offshore black money“In March 2012, the government of India clarified in its parliament that the CBI director's statement on $500 billion of illegal money[in foreign tax havens] was an estimate based on a statement made to India's Supreme Court in July 2011” Source: Indian black money - WikipediaThis translates to about 34 Lakh croresTotal black money = A + B = 35 + 34 = 69 Lakh croresThe question now is: How much of this black money is in cash and circulating inside India in form of 500 and 1000 Rs notes, which the demonetisation scheme might recover?C - Total currency in 500 and 1000 Rs. notes = 14 Lakh crores“the annual report of Reserve Bank of India (RBI) of 31 March 2016 stated that total bank notes in circulation valued to ₹16.42 lakh crore (US$240 billion) of which nearly 86% (around ₹14.18 lakh cror...

By Asher SvidenskyTea time on the Yamal peninsula..."	A good photo is one that is visually pleasing and has an original quality. But..It's a subjective question so there is no one right answer. It's also relative to how you're measuring what's good and what's not so good. A good photo in your collection may not be considered good if it is viewed in a magazine along side good photographs taken by other people. Here's an example of what I judge to be a good photo:There is very little to criticize about this photo. Sure it can be improved but it's a good photo.Here's an example of photo taken of another robin but I don't think it's a good photo:There are many things to criticize with this one. It's not a good photo IMO. But the person who took it may think it's good. The first example of the robin in the snow is much better when judged relative to this one. The main differences in the two shots are:better composition in the snowy picture. It follows more the rule of thirds. The focal point (the robin's eyes, head and chest) is too far towards the top in the second image. better background in the first example.better context in the first one. It's not everyday we see a beautiful robin surrounded by snow in our gardens. Snow is seasonal and it doesn't snow everywhere every year so a lot of people rarely see this scene in their garden. Whereas the second image is an everyday occurrence that anyone can see. And it's not original really in any way.The snowy robin picture is far superior technically. Resolution, sharpness, depth of field compliments the subject, nicer colours and is framed better.The first image is much cleaner. The robin looks more beautiful and is perfectly sharp. The rest of the image is pristine snow, a hint of a tree stump and an ideal background.The photographer who took the first one knew what they were doing and had much more expensive gear.A  photo can be judged as being good even if it doesn't meet the high  technical and compositional qualities that would usually be found in  professionally taken pictures. Because photography is an art it is  possible to take a visually pleasing photo taken with a crappy camera of  an everyday subject.Here's an example of a good photo that is technically poor (aside from composition) and is underexposed:The photographer achieved an artistic quality through underexposure and purposely tilting his iPhone and framing the woman nicely about one third from the left and her head is roughly one third from the top. To me the darkness in the picture is artistic. It's sort of unknown exactly what's across the street. Also it is thought provoking and makes me look at the image and wonder what it is that's going on.Here is what the image looks like when levels are adjusted and shows roughly what it would have been like had he correctly exposed the shot:I much prefer the first image. If the original picture was correctly exposed there would be much less artistic quality and it would not be as good.
do i need to get a tetanus shot again	do i need to get a tetanus shot	0	How long does a tetanus injection last? I know they say mostly 10 years, but at a clinic I asked, one said it’s only 3 months, so I don't know if this medical guy is untrained or something.	I would like to answer this question in 2 parts.Is Tetanus likely in this injury ? The answer is NO... Tetanus will commonly occur in deep wounds since it needs a lack of oxygen (anaerobic) environment to survive. So rusted nail injuries that are deep are perfect for causing tetanus, while superficial bruises are not likely to cause tetanus.Should you take a tetanus shot? Well, if you have not taken a tetanus shot in the last 10 years, please go ahead and take one. This is because you should ideally be vaccinated BEFORE an injury, and protection against Tetanus works for 10 years. So this tetanus shot will protect you against ANY injury in the next 10 years ...Warm regardsDr Gaurav Gupta, MD
how light bend with gravity	if gravity bends light can light bend gravity	1	"Thanks for A2A. Vitkor gave you the answer you need. As to the gravity bending of light, astronomical objects are a great way to show this as has been done repeatedly. My favorite, see the below from  Page on physicsworld.com: This is a photo of the view from the Hubble telescope. The zoomed in insert in upper right corner clearly has four visible yellow circles. These are actually four replicated views of a single supernova. The four views are caused by the gravity of a dense galaxy between Hubble and the supernova, which is the white blob you see in the middle. The light from the supernova is bent backwards around the galaxy along multiple paths creating this ""Einstein's cross""."	"Thanks for A2A. Vitkor gave you the answer you need.

what does it mean to hike up your skirt	what are some cute ways to cut up a skirt	0	To either roll the waistband so that the length is shortened, or to gather up the edges and either hold them up, or tuck them into your pants.The waistband trick is loved by schoolgirls around the globe, as your skirt is technically the regulation length, but when you’re off school premises, you can go as short as you like.The gathering trick is usually used to cool your legs on a hot day, to prevent your skirt dragging on the floor/in the mud or from tripping you up (if you’re wearing a maxi length skirt).	"This is a great time to wear cotton or similar material maxi skirts because you are so much cooler than wearing leggings, slacks , capris, etc. The freedom in a maxi skirt is priceless!You are going to look or feel cute based on your choices. For example, I see my cuteness when maxi skirt goes so well with any style or color topIc choose. I strive to choose a top with a light, solid color maxi skirt.With the warmer and hotter days approaching you may be scouring thrift and consignment stores for multicolored maxi skirts that by their style and color “exude"" cuteness.I consider crinkle style material to be cute.I am wearing a multicolored maxi skirt and whitetail that is shoulderless too, that emphasises my cute cleavage, I certainty feel cute while wearing a wedge style shoe that compliments my outfit. Sandals with nail polished toe nails can be cute, with a maxi skirt.Please enjoy and discover the true cute you and be the happiest women you can be!My love to all who enjoy their exciting femme side of life in their cute maxi skirt.

how many new cars are sold by maserati in america each year	has lotus actually sold any cars in america over the last 10 year	0	There are no exact (known) public sales figures, however it is widely known that the U.S. leads all other countries for Lamborghini. More cars are sold in the U.S. than any other country by quite a bit according to Lamborghini. With 2,121 cars sold globally in 2013, it's been rumored that a little less than half were in the U.S.  In 2014 however, that trend has shifted with the new Huracan. Over 3000 orders came in worldwide for the new model, of which 1/3 were from the U.S.  With China and the Middle East purchasing more  luxury/exotic cars, the percentage of Lamborghini's sold in the U.S. is likely going to decline. But, as Lamborghini keeps setting new sales records with popular models like the new Huracan, overall sales in the U.S. wikl undoubtedly grow.	Yes. My coworker has a 2007 Lotus Elise. Also don't forget there's the Lotus Evora. Motortrend tested one which was a model year 2011 sometime ago. In regards to your 2nd statement that you never see them, it depends where you are. If you're around the Palo Alto area, you'll see some. There's also 2 Lotus Exige down in San Jose I see sometimes, one grey and one orange.

how do you train a white pitbull with brown spots	how do i train white pitbulls	1	This answer was originally written for a different question, but Quora has since merged my answer to be included with the question you see above. If some comments or points seem out of place, I was probably referring to something relevant to my original asker.———————————————————————————————————————————That’s awesome! Dogs love to be mentally stimulated, so good on you for wanting to teach your dog new things.In dog training, there are basically two main areas that you want to spend your time learning about, even if only briefly:Classical conditioning:Where dogs make associations between things subconsciously (the famous Pavlov’s dogs experiment).This isn’t exactly what you’re looking for, so I won’t spend too much time on it right now, but it can be incredibly useful to know, because it’s constantly at play. I thought I’d throw it in for the sake of completion.What you should look into is Operant Conditioning:Every police K9, military working dog, bomb sniffer and TV canine actor you’ve seen has been trained via operant conditioning.This opens up the dog’s world to the concept of consequences. For any particular behaviour your dog performs, he may be reinforced or punished for it.Reinforcement: the promotion of a behaviour, in order to increase its likelihood of happening again.Punishment: the discouragement of a behaviour in order to decrease its likelihood of happening again.Further still, you can give(+) or take something away(-) from the dog in each case, referred to as positive and negative respectively So now we have this:Positive reinforcement: Giving your dog something desirable, in order to reward and promote a behaviour, eg. praising him for coming to you.Negative reinforcement: Taking something aversive away from your dog in order to reward and promote a behaviour, eg. removing pressure from their neck when they do what you want them to (old school dog training method).Positive punishment: Giving or applying something aversive to your dog to penalise and discourage a behaviour, eg. using traditional prong and choke collars to apply pressure to their neck when they do something you don’t like.Negative punishment: Taking something desirable away from your dog to penalise or discourage a behaviour, eg. turning your back when he jumps up for attention.These are the basic building blocks in dog training, and with them you can teach your dog pretty much anything they’re physically capable of doing.Timing is essential, because dogs live in the moment - so you want to reinforce or punish within seconds of the behaviour occurring, otherwise it’s a wasted effort.Consistency is everything in dog training. Whether you’re actively trying to train him or not, he’s always learning through classical and operant conditioning, so it’s good to be aware of how you’re behaving around your dog.Note: Negative reinforcement and positive punishment are best left to professionals, or people with a really solid understanding of these concepts, as there can be fallout when using aversive techniques if you aren’t careful - including increased fear, anxiety and aggression.Spend your time brushing up on positive reinforcement and negative punishment and you’ll be golden.Look at books like 101 dog tricks or 101 Puppy Tricks if you’d like to learn step-by-step how to teach particular tricks to your dog. I’ve bought them myself and it’s a wonderful resource for teaching all sorts of neat and hilarious things.If you’d like to learn more, I’ve written a more in-depth guide here and also made an visual guide here.Hope this helps!ReferencesReid, P.

I thought I’d throw it in for the sake of completion.What you should look into is Operant Conditioning:Every police K9, military working dog, bomb sniffer and TV canine actor you’ve seen has been trained via operant conditioning.This opens up the dog’s world to the concept of consequences. For any particular behaviour your dog performs, he may be reinforced or punished for it.Reinforcement: the promotion of a behaviour, in order to increase its likelihood of happening again.Punishment: the discouragement of a behaviour in order to decrease its likelihood of happening again.Further still, you can give(+) or take something away(-) from the dog in each case, referred to as positive and negative respectively So now we have this:Positive reinforcement: Giving your dog something desirable, in order to reward and promote a behaviour, eg. praising him for coming to you.Negative reinforcement: Taking something aversive away from your dog in order to reward and promote a behaviour, eg. removing pressure from their neck when they do what you want them to (old school dog training method).Positive punishment: Giving or applying something aversive to your dog to penalise and discourage a behaviour, eg. using traditional prong and choke collars to apply pressure to their neck when they do something you don’t like.Negative punishment: Taking something desirable away from your dog to penalise or discourage a behaviour, eg. turning your back when he jumps up for attention.These are the basic building blocks in dog training, and with them you can teach your dog pretty much anything they’re physically capable of doing.Timing is essential, because dogs live in the moment - so you want to reinforce or punish within seconds of the behaviour occurring, otherwise it’s a wasted effort.Consistency is everything in dog training. Whether you’re actively trying to train him or not, he’s always learning through classical and operant conditioning, so it’s good to be aware of how you’re behaving around your dog.Note: Negative reinforcement and positive punishment are best left to professionals, or people with a really solid understanding of these concepts, as there can be fallout when using aversive techniques if you aren’t careful - including increased fear, anxiety and aggression.Spend your time brushing up on positive reinforcement and negative punishment and you’ll be golden.Look at books like 101 dog tricks or 101 Puppy Tricks if you’d like to learn step-by-step how to teach particular tricks to your dog. I’ve bought them myself and it’s a wonderful resource for teaching all sorts of neat and hilarious things.If you’d like to learn more, I’ve written a more in-depth guide here and also made an visual guide here.Hope this helps!ReferencesReid, P.

what is the difference between a turkey and a chicken	why does turkey have darker more flavorful dark meat than chicken	0	Turkeys and chickens are both edible fowl that are commonly found in many areas. Their flavor is similar, but there are still many differences between the two birds.TaxonomyTurkeys and chicken share a similar taxonomy, and are the same up until the subfamily category. Both belong to the Animalia kingdom, the Chordata phylum , the Aves class, and the Galliformes order. However, the turkey is in the Phasianidae subfamily, with the genus being Meleagris. There are two distinct species-Meleagris gallopavo, which is the common domestic or wild turkey, and the Meleagis ocellata, or the ocellated turkey which is native to the Yucatan Peninsula in Mexico.Report this adLike the turkey, the chicken also belongs to the Animalia kingdom, the Chordata phylum, the Aves class, and the Galliformes order. However, it is a part of the Phasianinae subfamily, the Gallus genus, and the subspecies pf Gallus gallus domesticus. This is the species commonly known as the domesticated chicken.HistoryTurkey fossils have been found beginning in the Early Miocene era onward, all of which originated in North America. They were imported into Europe primarily by merchants from the country of Turkey, which is how they became known as turkey birds or turkeys.The domestic chicken is descended from the red junglefowl and they were first domesticated for cockfighting in Asia, Africa and Europe. There is a claim that they were first domesticated in Southern China as early as 6000 BC, but it is not clear as to whether those birds are actually related to the modern domestic chicken. They were considered a rare food in ancient Greece, but breeding of chickens increased under the Roman Empire, and they were also considered to be a sacred animal and were used as oracles. There is still a lack of data as to how the chicken spread to many regions of the world, but it has become a staple food source in many different counties.AppearanceTurkeys and chickens are relatively easy to distinguish based upon their physical appearance and characteristics. Turkeys are larger in size than chickens, usually by about 10 to 15 pounds, and will have very long tail feathers. They are also darker in color than chickens with no feathers on their neck and head. Turkey eggs are a tan or brown color.ChickenReport this adChickens are usually smaller than turkeys. The hens can be colorful or white, with roosters having striking plumage with long flowing tails and shiny, pointed feathers on their necks and backs. These feathers are usually a brighter color than what is found on hens. Roosters also have a large comb on the top of their head, hanging flaps of skin on either side of their beak called wattles, and will develop spurs on their legs. Chickens will have feathers on their head and necks, and their eggs are typically white in color.As foodBoth turkeys and chickens are eaten in many different areas of the world. They do have different flavors as well as nutritional differences. The meat from both birds contains vitamin B6 and niacin, which may be helpful in protecting against Alzheimer’s disease and general age-related mental decline. Both B6 and niacin can help support energy metabolism in the body. Turkey is relatively low in saturated fat and contains riboflavin, phosphorous, protein and selenium. It also contains the antioxidant zinc, which is useful as an immunity booster and helps regulate endocrine function and hormone levels. Turkey meat does have high cholesterol and sodium levels though. It is commonly eaten throughout the year in the US and Canada, and is the traditional meal served at Thanksgiving.Chicken tends to have more calories, fat, and cholesterol than turkey, but it also contains more omega fatty acids and protein. The typical serving of chicken breast meat contains about 165 calories, while turkey breast meat contains only 104. Chicken has less sodium and is also a good source of phosphorus, and selenium. Selenium can improve the body’s immune system when fighting against bacterial and viral infections, against cancer cells and the herpes virus. It also increases the good cholesterol, HDL, resulting in healthier heart function. Like turkey, it is also high in cholesterol.RearingTurkeys are generally wild, although raising them in domestic environments is becoming increasingly common. Commercial varieties of turkeys are also fast-growing. They require a high-protein diet. The modern turkey is a hybrid that is larger than wild varieties. This typically requires artificial insemination in commercial operations, which also allows for selective breeding with more females selected than males. This will lead to higher rates of hatchability. For breeding stock, the poults (baby turkeys) will be raised under environmentally-controlled conditions for 28 weeks, during which time the females grow to be about 24-30 pounds while the males will grow to 50-70 pounds. At 28 weeks, the females will typically begin producing eggs and will lay for about the next 26 weeks. In that time, they will lay about 100-130 eggs. The eggs are incubated and hatched. Once they reach a desired weight, the birds are transported for processing.Most chickens are also raised in a commercial setting for their meat and eggs. They mature at a faster rate than turkeys, taking only about 14 weeks to reach a size in which they could be processed. Chickens can also lay more eggs than turkeys, with some hens being able to lay over 300 eggs per year. Some chickens are kept	Not exactly. Dark and white meat, in chickens, is related to how much work that body part does - since chickens don’t do much flying, their chest muscles (the breast meat) doesn’t get much exercise.Since they aren’t flying, however, their leg muscles get a lot of work. This means that their leg muscles are much tougher, especially compared to their chest.Humans, however, use both our arms and our legs. So a better comparison would be to look at an animal that uses all four limbs - pigs are usually used for this, since they’re surprisingly similar to humans. And in an animal that uses all four of its limbs about equally, you don’t see white or dark meat; some parts would be tougher if the muscle for that area has seen a lot of use - so athletes would have much tougher leg or arm muscles than a sedentary office worker - but there isn’t usually a drastic difference in the texture and colour.

what is the difference between it and computer science engineering	what are the differences between computer science and computer engineering	0	"Origins of CSThe primary difference is that computer science was originally a sub-branch of mathematics. This is now known as theoretical computer science. Modern applied computer science deals with algorithms and software. Where hardware is studied it is only to inform the design and development of algorithms and software. As such computer science can either be extremely mathematical and focus only on graph theory, combinatorics, computational complexity theory, axiomatic set theory and propositional logic. OR it can be more applied as is the case almost universally in university programmes.Origins of CEComputer engineering has very different origins as a sub-branch of electronic engineering, which itself is a sub-branch of electrical engineering. Electrical engineering itself emerged as a specialisation from engineering science at the turn of the 20th century.In fact, even within electronic engineering the field of computer engineering emerges as a sub-branch of digital electronics. This is generally regarded as the ""easier"" electronics in the field, and stands in sharp contrast to analogue electronics which is legendarily difficult. Difficulty of CS vs CEI agree with the first half of answer Ken's answer but I don't entirely agree with his views on what's harder and what's not. It is true that in many countries engineering degrees tend to be harder or more rigorous than science degrees because it is, simultaneously, a science degree while also aiming to certify the practitioner and satisfy the professional requirements for admission to whatever necessary governing bodies. In the UK the engineering degrees are designed to be both academic enough to serve as a platform for further research while also meeting the stringent requirements to receive the title of Chartered Engineer with IMechE, IChemE, IEE (now, IET), etc. Hence, professionally accredited degrees in the UK are the BEng or MEng rather than the BSc or MSc. (Though an MEng is fundamentally different from an MSc too, but let's not get into that.)But as far as the fields themselves are concerned I don't think a broad generalization can be made. Some topics in computer science are of extraordinary difficulty. In fact the P vs NP problem in computer currently stands as one of the greatest open problems in mathematics. The solution of which would guarantee a Fields Medal. Though, engineering science has its own equally difficult open problems such as the Yang-Mills existence and mass gap which is in the domain of electrical engineering, and the Navier-Stokes existence and smoothness problem which is in fluid mechanics. (These three are Millenium Prize problems.)Certainly, web development and database design can be considered ""easier"" than, say, VLSI or transmission line analysis, so ""computer science"" can be said to have easier topics, however there are also many very difficult topics in the field. (Furthermore, I question the classification of such topics as computer science. True computer science is theoretical computer science.)Difficulty of CE vs EEEOne idea in Ken's answer that I reject is the idea that computer engineering is somehow more difficult than electrical engineering. This cannot be the case when one contains the other. Furthermore, this cannot be the case when computer engineering traditionally avoids or glosses over some of the most difficult topics in the field with which students struggle the most. These being, engineering electromagnetics and analogue electronics.

when will the best time for having sex	what would be the best time to have sex	1	When you're using a reliable form of birth control.Pregnancy can only occur if sex occurs during fertile days of the menstrual cycle - fertile days include ovulation and up to a week prior to ovulation when fertile cervical mucus may be present. Ovulation is when an egg is released from the ovary which typically occurs 14 days before menstruation, there may be a viable egg for up to 48 hours. Fertile cervical mucus protects the sperm from the acidic pH of the vagina and helps it to swim up through the cervix to go on to the fallopian tubes where they wait for ovulation - sperm could live in the vagina for up to seven days.It is possible to accurately determine when a person is fertile in order to time sex during a point in the menstrual cycle when there is no pregnancy risk - this is done by monitoring primary fertility signs such as basal body temperature, fertile cervical mucus, and cervical changes, also secondary fertility signs unique to the individual can be used too. Using observations of all fertility signs is known as Symptothermal Method (can be used in Fertility Awareness Method or Natural Family Planning - the former method allows other birth control methods to be used too, the latter method teaches abstinence during the fertile window) - this method is up to 98% effective. Unless using FAM/NFP you cannot know when a person could be fertile as even someone with the most regular cycles will have a few days variation in their cycle from time to time, and those few days difference could be enough to result in pregnancy. If sexually active you need to use some form of birth control if you wish to prevent unintended pregnancy, this is something that you should discuss with your partner. 	The best time for sex varies, depending on your gender. So while you might be up for it first thing in the morning, your partner might not want it until later at night. Finding the perfect time for sex can be difficult, but once you do, you’ll have a fantastic time.Morning sex - As others have stated, most men will reach their peak testosterone levels early in the morning. Women experience a similar peak in endorphins, though not as extreme or as early (usually between 8am and 10am). This means that you could easily enjoy some shower sex just before you go to work!Mid-aftenoon - Lunchtime tends not to be a great time to have sex. Most of us are in a bit of a slump from work, and so sex is the last thing on our mind. However, at 3pm, women will experience a spike in cortisol levels, giving them more energy. Men will find that their estrogen levels rise, making them more focused. If you need a break from work, meeting up for a quickie seems like the perfect way to do it!Evening time - Immediately after work usually isn’t a good time for sex. We are stressed, tired, and just want to relax. When the night draws to a close, it is a different matter entirely. A lot of women will feel completely re-energised between the hours of 8pm and 10pm, and sex is a great way to get rid of this excess energy. Plus, sex before bed can help you to get a good night’s sleep.A lot of the time it will depend on your schedule. If you and your partner are both too busy to have sex at the optimal times, you might have to figure out a compromise. Really, whenever you both want sex is the best time for it, so talk to your partner and find out when they are at their horniest.
how can i consult a good free online astrologer	are there any good free online astrologers	1	In last month, I consulted astrologer R.K Shridhar through Monkvyasa - Astrologer Online, got a reply within 6 hours with my detailed report also I could able to talk to him on the phone through their website. The website has a very simple design, working is not confusing like other astrology websites.	The problem with free horoscope website is, it will give you some random details, although there is very less chance of accuracy. Because, the horoscope generated by an automated code is far different from horoscope generated by an expert astrologer. Free horoscope, itself signifies that, you are looking for personal satisfaction or entertainment, rather than, looking for actual solution to your problem.People don’t respect something as much when it’s free, because they don’t have personal stake on it. If someone, wants to change their fate, look for marriage making, or thinking about opening a business, then this free mindset won’t help you much. Which is why, paid consultation with an expert astrologer, helps you to focus, since you have put money on it.There are many platforms, but I’d recommend Askmonk. It helps you provide easy, fast and affordable astrological solution and also provides 50% off for the first question. It has expert panel of in-house astrologers and it involves zero logistics, zero appointments. Just ask question when it pops in your mind. It is as easy as sending SMS. Also, it contains some underrated Hindu Mythological stories and daily horoscopes too.I’d recommend this app for hassle-free astrological consultation. It is available in Android Play Store and you can download on the following link:http://bit.ly/24BMbbu.PS: I’m from the Askmonk Team.

what are some of the most gruesome causes of death	what causes death by hanging	0	A software engineer succeeded in keeping under wraps the murder of his wife for two months but the law finally caught up with him on Sunday night. After a spat on the night of October 17, 2010 Rajesh Gulati (37) allegedly smothered his 36-year-old wife Anupama Gulati to death in their two-room rented house at Prakash Nagar in Dehradun Cantonment. To cover up the heinous crime, Rajesh bought an electric cutter from the market and chopped off the body into 70 pieces. Then he bought a deep freezer to stash away body pieces. Police sources said Rajesh also bought a bundle of black polythene carrybags to store the body parts. He had planned to secretly dump them at remote locations on Dehradun-Mussoorie road. When his four-year-old kids — twins Sonakshi and Sidhant — would enquire about their mother, Rajesh would tell them that she was away in Delhi. The murder came to light on Sunday morning when Anupama's elder brother, SK Pradhan, reached Dehradun and sent a friend to his sister's house with Anupama's passport. Suspecting foul play after they were unable to locate her, he lodged a missing complaint with the police. Acting swiftly, a joint team of Uttarakhand Special Task Force (STF) and Special Operations Group (SOG) conducted a raid at the techie's residence and cracked the case. Dehradun SSP G S Martolia said the police team recovered severed parts of the body, including Anupama's head, from the deep freezer after sustained interrogation of the accused. According to SSP Martolia, the culprit was taken to the shops from where he had bought the stone-cutter electric machine, polythene carrybags and deep freezer. He was also taken to spots where he had disposed off body parts. The accused is reported to have confessed to his crime. Narrating the sequence of events, IG (Garhwal Range) M A Ganpati said that on the night of the incident Rajesh slapped his wife after a domestic quarrel. ''He told us that she fell on the corner of a wall after which she became unconscious. A jittery Rajesh thinking that his wife, after regaining consciousness, would report the matter to the police decided to kill her. And then he throttled her by thrusting cotton into her nose and mouth before using pillow to kill her,'' said Ganpati. Rajesh was later remanded in a four-day police remand by the court of Dehradun chief judicial magistrate (CJM) Kunwar Amrindra Singh.Source: TOI 	Depends on how good/vicious your hangman is.The right amount of slack and a good amount of drop and correct placing of the knot will lead to breaking of the neck and almost instant death.Not enough slack means the drop won't be enough and you'll slowly suffocate and you'll be a good entertainment for the audience who watch you dance as you die.Too much slack/not enough drop means you hit the ground and you get to have another round.Incorrect placing of the knot could lead to only a slight fracture of the neck, leaving you paralyzed, but alive until you die of suffocation.
what is latency in telecom	how does wifi latency compare to wired ethernet	0	"SPEED, BANDWIDTH & LATENCY – now demystifiedThe best way to explain these terms is by using an analogy.Imagine bandwidth like a freeway, where all cars (here ‘data’) travel at the same speed.To receive more data from the internet and make your downloads faster, the freeway needs to be ‘wider’. In other words, say 1 Mbps is equivalent to 1 lane freeway. Now if you are trying to download a 5 Mb image, and you have a bandwidth of 1 Mbps, it would take you roughly 5 seconds to download the image.Now let’s say that you have a 5 Mbps (bandwidth) connection or a 5 lane freeway. How fast will you receive your image? 1 second.Simply, more bandwidth means that you’ll have access to high-speed data in a given time. In this situation, you can download 5 images with the wider bandwidth in the same amount of time you could 1 with a narrower bandwidth.Now, it doesn’t necessarily mean that internet speed is any higher at 1 Mbps or 5 Mbps and above. It’s simply processing of your data becomes faster due to a wider bandwidth where more data can be sent simultaneously. It’s more efficient, making your internet perceptually faster, not technically faster.In other words, it means that you ‘are made to sense the immediate experience of faster downloads with promises like 5 Mbps ‘speed’, when it actually is a question of both bandwidth and latency.Latency in simple terms means delay.It is usually measured in milliseconds or ms and is the amount of delay (or time) it takes to send information from one point to another.Understanding latency in times of 4GPresent-day networks have achieved impressive speeds with 4G Long Term Evolution networks connecting subscribers and applications 100 times faster than 2G networks. With the coming of new-age technology, network speeds will only increase in the future. However, network performance is not only about speed.Networks that have the better bandwidth (read wider space) and low latency (read less delay) will be able to pass benefits to the subscribers in this age of digital transformation.A small country like Australia has been up-and-coming with improved speeds due to ""big network investments from telecom companies such as Telstra and Vodafone[1] "". They have now risen three places to rank seventh globally on average download speeds, and 13th globally in terms of 4G availability.4G as an offering today comes with lower latency levels; decreased latency levels are defining moments in use, permitting innovative concepts like AI, VR and IoT to flourish.How is latency different from bandwidth and speed?Imagine a pipe.Bandwidth has to do with how wide or narrow the pipe isLatency has to do with the contents of the pipe and how fast it moves from one end to the otherLatency is a way to measure the speedRole and relevance of latency todayMany applications in Virtual Reality and Augmented Reality had not realized their full potential prior to high-speed networks; innovative concepts couldn’t leave the design stage because high latency punctured the very idea of a solution.For example, the success of driverless automobiles depends entirely on the communication backbone and its performance. For a driverless car to weave in and out of high-speed bumper to bumper traffic, it needs to be plugged into a network that will offer connectivity with lowest latency levels. A delay in transmitting and receiving a signal or an input can be disastrous on the roads where split-second reflexes rule the roads.Similarly, IoT is being deployed in healthcare today. Many automated medical devices are now equipped to provide verbal training about a procedure and reminders of when users should take prescribed medication, check blood pressure, or exercise. The problem is that the things (e.g., sensors, gadgets, controls, etc.) of the IoT depend on the responsiveness of a system or network to work effectively. High latency means delayed responsiveness. With delayed responsiveness, comes the inability of the things to function to their full capacity.Since the majority of technology emerging today is about making the experience immersive for the audience, this value-chain simply can’t afford lags.Delays could realistically mean the difference between life and death, which is also why major ‘breakthroughs’ in technology evolve over a certain time.Networks need to ensure that all channels are effectively up and running—cameras, Radar, Sonar, GPS and Lidar. Split second connectivity is the key to the success of driverless cars and this cannot be achieved by merely increasing bandwidth. Advanced collision prevention systems, pedestrian detection technology, brake assist[2] and similar solutions can be truly effective only when latency is low.Gaining the edgeUsers would certainly not like to enjoy downloads that occur at high speeds, pause in between and resume, with the cycle continuing. And applications will end up turning counterproductive if latency levels impact the delivery of solutions.Networks need to offer connectivity where the response time is below hundreds of milliseconds. Beyond these thresholds, users experience lag and this affects the overall experience.For a seamless experience total latency needs to be reduced to lower levels. Networks need to be committed to improving user experience and serve application needs better with higher network speeds, qualified by lower latency levels.[1] https://www.zdnet.com/article/op...[2] https://www.cabotsolutions.com/2..."	"Wired ethernet is about an order of magnitude lower ping time for machines on the same network (i.e. single hop). For example, on my home network, I see approximately 0.3ms wired ethernet ping vs 3ms wireless ethernet ping. This is because of the more extensive error checking and protocol requirements of wifi. More importantly, however, wired ethernet has much lower ""jitter"" or variation in the ping time. Because of interference from microwaves, other devices using a shared spectrum, usage of nearby channels, etc, there is a much greater variation in the ping time over wifi. Of course, if you are using local wifi to connect to a router connected to the Internet, it is important to remember that the wifi is the last link, and it may not make much of a difference if your ping time to the server you are interested in is much greater."
is senior residency at hindu rao hospital teaching experience	i am studying bs computer science i am in 7th semester and can not pass the basic programming course wasted alot money	0	Internship at Hindu Rao Hospital is totally a different world. Me being from a private college have seen both the worlds of Private as well as Government.At Hindu Rao, best thing is you get to learn a lot if you want to. There is no speciality department you can do work in but because of that you learn to know basic things more rather than indulging yourself in things which are not helping you as an MBBS.After internship in Hindu Rao, you can just stand anywhere and proudly say that yes i am a Doctor and knows many basic things which most people lacks.Everyone is friendly in here and get to know a lot of new people( that's the beat part i think).	I am an Indian planning to pursue my MS in Computer Science. I have a great passion towards programming and research and am currently passing from 6th to 7th semester of my B.tech CSE course. How do I take the next step?
what behavioral adaptations do pandas have	what behavioral adaptations do red pandas have	0	The U.S. has accomplished much in assisting China to care for its Giant Pandas. Yet in spite of all this why can't China give the Americans on...	"Evolution is wonderfully unpredictable. A million years ago, if you were plopped down in Africa and asked which animal would soon become the dominant species, I pretty much guarantee you wouldn't have selected the soft little hominid with the big head and funny gait. So any answer you get is going to be highly speculative.The reason we became the dominant species on Earth is this:Unlike our competitors, we started walking upright. And then we started running. By becoming the world's elite long distance runner, we ensured that we could kill and eat high protein animals that were faster than us, but that couldn't keep running as long as we could. Once we could do that, our brains got bigger as a result and the rest is history... tools, language, agriculture, and so on...So who's next? Accepting that we have no idea which evolutionary leap (like upright walking) may lead to the next dominant species, we can at least guess based on a few assumptions:1. The overall ecosystem of Earth is more complex and sophisticated now than it was when bacteria, trilobytes, or even dinosaurs were the dominant species. This means that unless there's another massive die-off, the next dominant species will likely be highly adaptable, if not extra-ordinarily intelligent (and likely self-aware).2. There are a bunch of species that are quite deeply evolved, since they evolved along side us. As such, they don't have anywhere near as far to go as we humans had to evolve. In some cases, I suspect if humans disappeared, a few candidates would just need a couple hundred thousand years and some luck to end up in a similar situation to us.3. True success and dominance at this point probably requires evolution of a means of force multiplication. That means evolving tools and/or behaviors that maximize the production/collection of food. This probably requires several or all of the following traits:Sociability - loners don't develop sophisticated social queues or tools. So most strict carnivores like big cats, even though they usually physically superior, are poor candidates for evolutionary dominance on modern Earth.Dexterity - Lack of fine motor skills makes it very hard to do the whole tool, agriculture, dominance path thing. Note: ""hands"" aren't required, but a highly dextrous body extension seems critical to me. Octopus arms, Elephant trunks could work. The key is a non-locomotive manipulator ""hand"".Access to fire - Sorry, dolphins and octopuses. While its certainly possible for smarter aquatic life to become dominant below the waves, it's hard to imagine any cetacean or cephalopod evolving to dominate outside their world. That's not to say one of them might not ""rule the waves"" so to speak.Decent life-span - Moreso than being stuck in saltwater, this is really why Octopi are a bad candidate. 2-3 year lifespans are not the stuff of global dominance.So we're looking for smart, adaptable, non-aquatic social animals in need of just an evolutionary jump or two to take them over the top. If they already use tools, that's a good sign. If they already use complex group-based food gathering tactics, that's another good sign.My candidates:Chimps and Bonobos - Our closest relatives are the obvious choice. Tool users. Highly social. There's a reason ""Planet of the Apes"" was popular. It doesn't take much imagination to envision these guys taking over the world. For ever other species' sake, let's hope its the Bonobos, not the Chimps. Much like us, chimps are assholes. Baboons and Orangutans - Large, social old-world monkeys are probably next up, for similar reasons. Baboons in particular interest me because of their higher levels of environmental adaptability.Gorillas - Size may limit them to certain habitats now, but one could imagine them learning how to make their favorite foods more available over time and spring-boarding from there. Sorry, but for the short-term,..."

what is the fastest production car	what is the world  fastest street legal car	0	Fastest could mean a lot of different things.People have posted a lot of cars on here that are the fastest production cars, but probably not the fastest cars that are road-legal. Tuner cars can be faster than even the fastest hypercar, because there’s really no need to worry about reliability, aesthetics, or ease-of-manufacture.There are two different good definitions of “fast” where I can start looking for road-legal cars: Top speed and acceleration.Top speed for a production car is easy; that’s just how fast a car goes. The fastest “production” car is the Bugatti Veyron Super Sport, which reaches a top speed of 267.85 mph (431.06 kph):It gets a little harder if you want to find the top speed of a road legal car. Most top speed racing doesn’t check that the car is road-legal, so it’s hard to verify a record. However, I’m going to use the Modified- and Factory-class Bonneville Salt Flats records, which are maintained by the Southern California Timing Association. The fastest record that I could find for a modified production car was by a 1990’s Pontiac Trans-Am running nitrous injection (and probably a motor swap) at 308.98 mph (497.26 kph):For acceleration, the most reliable measure of “fastest” would be a 1/4-mi (400m) drag race. People like to quote 0–60 mph (0–100 kph) times, but tuner cars have become so fast that the difference is hard to measure accurately.Just for fun, the fastest production car 0–60 mph is the Porsche 918 Spyder, at 2.2 sec, followed closely enough to mention by the Tesla Model S P100D Ludicrous+ at 2.28 sec:The fastest production car to do a 1/4 mile is, again, the Bugatti Veyron Super Sport, and it does it in 9.7 sec (speed unlisted, but probably ~150 mph):The fastest 1/4 mile by a road legal car is a very sought-after record in the USA, and tends to change from year to year, and sometimes month-to-month. In 2016 it was held by a modified 1969 Chevrolet Camaro, which ran a quarter-mile in 5.85 sec at 251 mph:To all the naysayers of this particular record (the car certainly doesn’t look road-legal), this car participates in an event called Hot Rod Drag Week. All Drag Week vehicles are required to drive under their own power from track to track to compete. It is registered and completely road-legal, and you can see the registration sticker in the windshield on videos of it running.Hope that answers your question!

how magnets are made	what are magnets made of	0	"How Neodymium Magnets are madeNeodymium Iron Boron is an alloy made mainly from a combination of Neodymium, Iron, Boron, Cobalt and varying levels of Dysprosium and Praseodymium.The exact chemical composition within NdFeB depends on the grade of NdFeB. Dysprosium and Praseodymium are added as a replacement for some of the Neodymium to improve the corrosion resistance and to improve the Hci (Intrinsic coercivity) of the ""Neo"". An example of the composition is given below.Typical composition of NdFeB alloyMain Elements within NdFeBPercentage by weightNeodymium (Nd) 29% - 32%Iron (Fe) 64.2% – 68.5%Boron (B) 1.0% - 1.2%Aluminium (Al) 0.2% - 0.4%Niobium (Nb) 0.5% -1%Dysprosium (Dy) 0.8% -1.2%The method of manufacture of Neodymium Iron Boron magnets is as follows:-The Neodymium metal element is initially separated from refined Rare Earth oxides in an electrolytic furnace. The ""Rare Earth"" elements are lanthanoids (also called lanthanides) and the term arises from the uncommon oxide minerals used to isolate the elements. Although the term ""Rare Earth"" is used, it does not mean that the chemical elements are scarce. The Rare Earth elements are abundant e.g. Neodymium element is more common than gold. The Neodymium, Iron and Boron are measured out and put in a vacuum induction furnace to form an alloy. Other elements are also added, as required for specific grades e.g. Cobalt, Copper, Gadolinium and Dysprosium (e.g. to assist with corrosion resistance). The mixture is melted due to the high frequency heating and melting the mixture.In simplified terms, the ""Neo"" alloy is like a cake mixture with each factory having its own recipe for each grade. The resultant melted alloy is then cooled to form ingots of alloy. The alloy ingots are then broken down by hydrogen decrepitation (HD) or hydrogenation disproportionation desorption and recombination (HDDR) and jet milled down in a nitrogen and argon atmosphere to a micron sized powder (about 3 microns or less in size). This Neodymium powder is then fed into a hopper to allow the pressing of magnets to occur.There are three main methods of pressing the powder – axial and transverse pressing. Die pressing requires tooling to make a cavity that is slightly larger than the required shape (because sintering causes shrinkage of the magnet). The Neodymium powder enters the die cavity from the hopper and is then compacted in the presence of an externally applied magnetic field. The external field is either applied parallel to the compacting force (this axial pressing is not so common) or perpendicular to the direction of compaction (this is called transverse pressing). Transverse pressing gives higher magnetic properties for the NdFeB.A third method of pressing is isostatic pressing. The NdFeB powder is put into a rubber mould and is put into a large fluid filled container which then has the pressure of the fluid increased. Again an external magnetizing field is present but the NdFeB powder is compacted from all sides. Isostatic pressing gives the best possible magnetic performance for Neodymium Iron Boron. The methods employed vary depending on the grade of ""Neo"" required and are decided by the manufacturer.The external magnetizing field is created by a solenoid coil set either side of the compacting powder. The magnetic domains of the NdFeB powder align with the magnetising field that is applied – the more homogenous the applied field, the more homogenous the magnetic performance of the Neodymium magnet. As the Neodymium powder is pressed by the die, the direction of magnetisation is locked in place – the Neodymium magnet has been given a preferred direction of magnetisation and is called anisotropic (if no external field were applied it would be possible to magnetise the magnet in any direction, which is called isotropic, but the magnetic performance would be much lower than that of an anisotropic magnet and is usually confined to bonded magnets).Rare Earth magnets exhibit uniaxial magnetocrystalline anisotropy i.e. they have a unique axis crystal structure corresponding with the easy axis of magnetisation. In the case of Nd2Fe14B, the easy axis of magnetisation is the c-axis of the complex tetragonal structure. In the presence of an external magnetizing field, it aligns along the c-axis, becoming capable of being fully magnetised to saturation with a very high coercivity.Before the pressed NdFeB magnet is released it is given a demagnetizing pulse to leave it unmagnetised. The compacted magnet is termed a 'green' magnet – it is easy to force to crumble apart and its magnetic performance is not good. The ‘green’ Neodymium magnet is then sintered to give it its final magnetic properties. The sintering process is carefully monitored (a strict temperature and time profile has to be applied) and occurs in an inert (oxygen free) atmosphere (e.g. argon). If oxygen is present, the resultant oxides destroy the magnetic performance of the NdFeB. The sintering process also causes shrinkage of the magnet as the powder fuses together. The shrinkage gives a magnet close to the required shape but the shrinkage is usually uneven (e.g. a ring may shrink to become an oval). At the end of the sintering process a final rapid quench is applied to rapidly cool the magnet. This is to minimize the unwanted production of ‘phases’ (in simplified terms, variants of the alloy with poor magnetic properties) that occurs at temperatures below the sintering temperature. A rapid quench maximizes the magnetic performance of NdFeB. Because the sintering process causes an uneven shrinkage, the shape of the Neodymium magnet will not be to the required dimensions.The next stage is to machine the magnets to the required tolerances. Because machining is required, the Neodymium magnets are made slightly larger when being pressed e.g. larger outer diameter, smaller inner diameter and taller for a ring magnet. Standard magnet dimensional tolerances are +/-0.1mm although +/-0.05mm is achievable at extra cost. The possibility of even tighter tolerances depends on the shape and size of the magnet and may not be achievable. For note, the Neodymium magnet is very hard. Trying to cut holes in NdFeB with a standard drill or carbide tip will blunt the drill bit. Diamond cutting tools (CNC diamond grinding wheels, diamond drills, etc) and wire cutting machines (EDM) have to be used. The NdFeB swarf powder produced during machining needs to be cooled by liquid otherwise it may spontaneously combust. For Neodymium block magnets, there may be cost savings in using much larger magnet blocks made by isostatic pressing and cutting them into smaller Neodymium blocks of the desired size. This is done for speed and for mass production (where enough cutting and grinding machines are present) and is known as ""slice and dice"". Once the final dimensions for the magnet has been met by machining, the Neodymium magnet is given a protective coating. This is usually a Ni-Cu-Ni coating.The magnet must be cleaned to remove any swarf/powder from machining. It is then dried thoroughly before being plated. It is imperative that the drying is thorough otherwise water is locked into the plated Neodymium magnet and the magnet will corrode from the inside out. The plating is very thin e.g. 15-35 microns for Ni-Cu-Ni (1 micron is 1/1000mm). The current range of coatings available are as follows:- Nickel-Copper-Nickel (Ni-Cu-Ni) [standard], Epoxy, Zinc (Zn), Gold (Au), Silver (Ag), Tin (Sn), Titanium (Ti), Titanium Nitride (TiN), Parylene C, Everlube, Chrome, PTFE (""Teflon""; white, black, grey, silvery) , Ni-Cu-Ni plus Epoxy, Ni-Cu-Ni plus Rubber, Zn plus Rubber, Ni-Cu-Ni plus Parylene C, Ni-Cu-Ni plus PTFE, Tin (Sn) plus Parylene C, Zinc Chromate, Phosphate Passivation and Uncoated (i.e. bare – not recommended but is sometimes required by the customer). Other coatings may be possible. It is not recommended to use the magnet without a protective layer.Higher Hci Neodymium magnets are said to be better at corrosion resistance but this does not guarantee safe use when unplated. If necessary plate the magnets after assembly (this is because any glue would adhere to the plating rather than the NdFeB magnet and so if the plating fails, the magnet becomes free). Removing the plating to allow better glue adhesion is possible but corrosion resistance in the Neodymium magnet may be severely compromised during such a process unless great care is taken during assembly (protective sleeves may be worth considering to ensure the magnets stay in place e.g. carbon fibre sleeve for rotors).15-30 microns Ni-Cu-Ni Standard coating requiredEpoxy resins are not hermeticThickness buildup can be a problemOnce plated the Neodymium magnet is then magnetized. The Neodymium magnet is placed in a solenoid coil which is energized to produce a field at least 3 times the value of the magnet’s Hci. It is not unusual for Rare Earth magnets to be 'hit' with a field of 5T. The Rare Earth magnets sometimes have to be physically held in place within the coil otherwise the magnet may react to the applied magnetizing pulse and is propelled out of the coil (a bit like a bullet). The Neodymium magnet, being an isotropic, has a direction of magnetization locked within its structure. When being magnetized, this direction of magnetization within the structure aligns with the magnetizing field. If the magnet is not aligned with the magnetizing field, the magnet will violently spin to align up. It is possible for the magnet to break up / shatter due to the high rotational forces acting on the domains within the magnet. The magnet must be magnetized to saturation to get the maximum performance output. If the magnet is not aligned with the magnetizing field, full saturation of Neodymium may not be achieved."	The best mined material for a permanent and scary powerful magnet is neodymium. I’m not a scientist so you may wish to google the specifics. All I know is that I bought tiny neodymium magnets on eBay before realizing their potentially destructive magnetic force. A one inch cube stuck to my dryer side and I needed to pry it off. Two of these could crush a finger. In tiny sizes, neodymium magnets could be used in everyday items where you don’t want the magnet to lose its strength over time. Neodymium is also used in electric car batteries, but its dirty mining and scarcity pushed for other environmentally greener solutions.

I have no desire to participate in illegal activity, nor do I wish to potentially contribute to a possible overdose.I live in a small town of around 20,000 yet there are hundreds who have died from overdose in the last decade from this town alone. My town has been called by national government officials and reported by national and international media as the epicenter of the drug abuse problem of the nation. There are mutiple episodes on some addict show about people from this area. (Intervention? Addicted? I don't remember which, probably both.)We get the problems here before they spread to the rest of the country. All those recent deaths from that fentanyl with the elephant tranquilizer? That was here, and you request an A2A so I can contribute to this problem?!?These medications might make you feel good for a bit, but they will cause you to stop breathing. Talk about people who deserve a Darwin award. This is the reason we now have Narcan available without a prescription.I am tired of people who abuse these medications and ruin it for people who have legitimate uses. I am worn out of needing to babysit people like you who want to either sell it or abuse it and avoid life, ultimately interfering with needed treatment for people who have ruptured discs in their spine or pain from cancer.If I've misjudged and you are one of those people with a legal script, I apologize. I'm sure you're also tired of the abusers who make it difficult for you to get your needed medication. Call your local pharmacy, they'll quote you the cost.

Ok!?Anyway, please see the below answers for the absolute value for both reals and complex numbers. I would add an example though: assume someone has a debit card with $10 on it and a credit card with $10 on it. This implies that the absolute value of these two cards is the same (i.e., 10), while mathematically speaking the value of the debit card is 10, but the value of the credit card is -10. However because |-10| = |10|, the sentence “Hey, I have a credit card with $10 on it” means that it is a negative number (in real world, you’ll have to pay it back to the bank :( ).As for your question, What is ""true value"" in mathematics?, this is a previous Quora enquiry.

what are the qualifications for being an fbi or cia agent	what does it take to become an fbi agent	0	CIA:At least 18 years of ageHold a bachelor’s degree with at least a 3.0 GPABe a US citizenFBI:At least 23 years of age, but no more than 37Hold a bachelor’s degreeHold a valid driver’s licenseHave 3 years of professional work experience (Law Enforcement or relevant private sector fields- For example, if you’re going in to white collar crime, business management counts for experience)Be a US citizenI’m sure the CIA is much more selective.	First and foremost, you would need to become a U.S. citizen. The rest of the basic eligibility requirements are here: Special Agents | FBIJOBS.Other than that, it's impossible to answer (briefly) in the abstract. In part, because there are so many avenues, not to mention an element of luck, to getting hired. And especially because the Bureau's roster of needs and hiring process can change massively over the course of 10-15 years (which is when you would likely be applying): today's Bureau is in many ways very different from its pre-9/11 mission. The most likely constant will be a preference for applicants with foreign language skills, native fluency especially. (Also, don't take a job working directly for your current or any other foreign government.)Honestly, the Bureau probably doesn't do anything your country’s own law enforcement, domestic security, and intelligence agencies don't themselves do already (at least collectively).FYI, I'm a huge fan of young women having an early look at law enforcement and intelligence work. Perhaps the best advice is to find stuff that fascinates you, that you are good at, and would want to be even better at in the future. As an example: I know an agent who liked acting, fell in love with Shakespeare, became fascinated by the authorship question, all of which lead to a career as a lawyer specializing in forensic linguistics and (eventually) his getting hired by the Bureau.

hypothetical scenario our actual credit card system  and  banking never existed before how would you implement a digital currency on the internet today	what are some inventions from the neolithic age	0	NOTE: This answer is not written to specifically explain why interest is haram in Islam. It may or may not have any links to the real reasons. I am also not an Islamic scholar. This is a long answer, but if you are interested in understanding how money works, keep reading.Have you ever thought about the fact why every country on Earth, including US, the country with the highest GDP, all are in debt? not just a small amount, but trillions of dollars of debt? Have you wondered who do we owe so much debt to? Read along and you will understand why.Let us for a sake of understanding forget all the queries you have mentioned about the benefits of interest and take an example of an extremely simplified scenario which when extended you will realize why interest is the root cause of all the evil in the world. I am going to use this example to simplify the relation between interest and inflation.Assume a hypothetical scenario, John and Bob, the only two guys living in a small, economically independent village. John needs money to start a business or for whatever reason, doesn't matter, say $100 (For example purposes $ is just a reference for money and not an actual US dollar). He doesn't have it, so he asks Bob to lend it to him. Bob has exactly $100 and so he agrees to lend it, provided John pays back with 10% interest. John agrees. John takes the $100, uses it. He has to pay back $100 + $10 as interest. The problem is, there are only $100 available in the village, how is he going to get that extra $10? This small village is now in $10 of debt. Bob will have to find a way to resolve it, else the economy will collapse.Enter Inflation. What Bob does is, that he print another $100. Since new money has been created out of nowhere, without any backing, this currency has now become Fiat. Now Bob wants, that John again borrows this money from him, for this reason, he lowers the interest rate from 10% to 1%. This is the reason why interest rates are low, during high inflation.John now sees a lucrative deal to borrow another $100 for such a low interest rate, and also pay off his previous debt. Great idea right? WRONG! He borrows the newly printed $100, and pays back his previous loan of $110.Lets summarize this scenario.Total money in Economy: $200Money remaining with John: $90Money already returned to Bob by John: $110Money still left to be paid back by John to Bob: $100 (from the new loan) + $1 (interest) = $101This means that if John again wants to pay back his loan, he will now be $101–$90= $11 in debt instead of the previous $10. So with the new printing of money, the economy went further into debt, from $10 to $11. There is no way John can ever repay this loan because the extra $11 does not exist in the economy and this cycle keeps continuing.At this point, Bob really does not care that his $11 cannot be repaid by John ever, because now John is essentially his slave. John doesn't know it yet, and will never know, that's the beauty of Modern Slavery.Bob will also provide a host of other options to John to make him feel he is trying to help, like giving him new credit/credit card to pay off his previous debt, or EMI, or cashbacks, or some stupid gift or bonuses, or credit rating.Scale it up, and this is exactly how the real world operates, but to make sure that a huge majority of the people do not understand this scam, the system is made much more complex with bonds and federal reserve or reserve bank, and all those hocus pocus terms you hear but hardly understand, by our own democratically elected govt and the lobbyists.

how does quora quickly mark questions as needing improvement	why does quora mark my questions as needing improvementclarification before i have time to give it details literally within seconds nonascii 	1	Well, the quality of questions has really gone down. I myself have downvoted and reported many questions in the last two weeks. There are many insincere questions, questions very poorly formed, questions that don't look like they really are looking for serious answers. One of the most annoying is the kind of question which can be found out in one click on the Internet and is not a matter of opinion, and more annoying is the repeated question. Why don't people take just a few seconds to type in the question in the Quora search box and find out whether it has been adequately answered or not? Is it asking too much?Today I read an answer for “What are some of the most merged questions in Quora?”. One top answer was, “Who would win between a lion and a tiger?”. You should check out the number of variations of the same question and some very adequate answers right now. Only about half an hour later, a question popped up in my feed asking, “Who would win a fight between a lion and a tiger?”. I tell you it is very very irritating and annoying and shows some insincerity on the part of the OP.So,I am also all for not only Quora recommending edits and removing questions as well as answers, but also all other members not ignoring such instances like badly phrased or insincere questions, and downvoting and reporting them.

how will i contact a good hacker	how can i hire a hacker	1	First, allow me to say that no anon speaks for any other, nor the hive. i speak for my own anon-self, a decade in the making. That said…Your question is akin to asking to “join” the internet. You don’t sign up per say, you simply facilitate a connection and there it is, the interwebz in all its glory and horror and informations. There is no specific group anonymous, hackers or otherwise to join. Anonymous is an idea, a way of life if you will, that seeks to free humanity from the followers of greed. I have heard a saying that I think explains this rather well,“Being anonymous is like being in love. No one can tell you if you are or you’re not, you just know.”Keeping the above in mind always, there are resources out there though that might help you to find others of like minds and interests to play with. OpNewBlood for example, might be one place to start.If you want to become a hacker, the best thing you can do is to learn the basics, hone your skills and possess a sound understanding of the art. You will find those hackers who might be well known or infamous for being GOOD at what they do, all share one thing in common, see rules #1 and #2 of the rules of the internet.Important note for those seeking to learn about anonymous:Be very aware that there are those out there… channels and sites which call themselves anonymous, but their only goal is profit. It should be known that there exists no official channel, ‘HQ’, profile or site which represents anonymous. Any such claim or title should render said entity suspect immediately, as most certainly they use the anonymous namesake for their own personal gain through click bait and other nefarious tactics. A true anon does not profit from any effort undertaken in anonymous’ name. Period.Anonymous are not want you to think like anonymous. Anonymous just wants you to think.Thanks to Gina Floyd for requesting I answer this question. I hope my answer is helpful.	Because you can’t talk machine into doing what you want. But with people - you can! If you don’t understand the difference - likely tech guys will consider you dumb.It all boils down to causality. We all study basic maths and physics at school and get the idea that the equation won’t solve itself. And we won’t either unless we strictly follow the rules and do everything right.Because you can’t talk machine into doing what you want. But with people - you can!

what are the best horror novel in 2016	what are some of the best horror novels of 2014	0	"The VVitchI saw ""The VVitch'' back in early March and I thought it was decent, but I didn't understand what all the fuss was all about. Yeah, it looked nice and it had a chilling atmosphere but that's the only thing I got from it. Well, to be fair, I think I was the only one that I liked this movie compared to my friends and family, as they thought the movie was terrible. I liked the movie but I thought it was kind of slow, I was a bit confused at times and the movie didn't stick with me after it was done. If I was reviewing this back in March, I would probably give this movie a 3/5.But after re-watching the film, I actually liked it even more and there was a lot of things that I can't believe I missed on my first viewing. I don't know how to explain it, but I had this uncomfortable feeling from watching this that I never experience the first time. This is a horror movie that exceeds in film making, it's freaky score and it's gloomy atmosphere that really made this film a true horror.This is a great psychological horror film that can really get under the your skin. I started to notice little details that really made this movie freaking scary when you understand the meaning of it. This doesn't have any stupid jump scars that deflates tension or just any horror movie tropes that we've seen million times already, but that's nowhere to be seen in the ''The VVitch''.THANK GOODNESS!Oh and the cinematography is this movie is just flawless. I'm starting to notice a trend in indie horror movies today - With the shots being perfectly set up and the very little use of light that really adds to the atmosphere to this film.Thank you Robert Eggers for your brilliant direction and this movie."

what is the most beautiful thing that you have ever seen	what is the most beautiful thing ever built	0	My brother and I went to the same school.When I was in grade 3, my brother and I got into an argument at home. I had stolen his pancakes and in retaliation, he landed a flurry of punches on my face.I was itching for revenge. My brother was in grade 6.At school, I gathered a few of my friends and told them what happened at home. We decided to square my brother off.During the break, roughly about ten of my friends and I marched toward my brother’s classroom. We were not scared of his seniority. We were armed with deadly weapons such as rulers, lunch bags, water bottles etc.When we reached his classroom, one of his friends informed him of my siege. He walked out curiously.“What the hell are you doing, Ben?” he asked, looking surprisingly at the phalanx of soldiers watching my back.“WHY DID YOU PUNCH ME?” I asked(read squealed) aggressively.“Wha—?” he couldn’t believe I was doing that.“Okay…okay..I am sorry. I am sorry….Go back to your classroom. The break is going to be over.”He looked around him frequently. He clearly did not want to be embarrassed.Flexing my muscles, I had a fervent discussion with my soldiers and we, as a team, decided to let him go.“This is a warning for you,” I warned my brother and walked back to my classroom, flanked by my Commanders.Rumor has it that my brother and his friends were found rolling on the floor and laughing hard as we marched back.Many years went by.It was my mom’s farewell. My family was there.When she was asked to speak, she spoke of a lot of things. She narrated what happened between me and my brother years ago.Then, she said this: “I am proud of a lot of things I have done, but what I am most proud of is how I raised my children.”“The aggression I saw in Ben at such a young age troubled me as a mother.”“But I did not tell him that aggression was bad. I just showed him the right way to use aggression and violence. I am sure he would wrestle a lion if that is what it takes to protect his brothers.”The crowd burst into a loud applause.With the dying applause, she looked into the rows of teachers and said assertively: “Do not tell your children that aggression is bad. That violence is bad. Tell them where to use those.”“As much as I have told them the importance of kindness, I have taught them to protect the ones they love.”“You need aggression. You need violence. You should know how to land a good punch. Just know where and when to use those”As she got down from the dais magnificently folding her Saree, I looked at her with awe and chaos.Mom is hard to understand. She speaks of love, compassion, and kindness.But all of a sudden, she would speak of smacking people if that is what takes to protect loved ones.She is inconsistent. She is flawed. She is selfish. She is human.Maybe she has her reasons. Through the maps of wrinkles I see on her face, maybe there are obscure stories I would not understand.But—In the midst of all her imperfections, hypocrisies, and mistakes, love sustains.I find this flaw to be beautiful. This human part of her. This selfish morsel of her is beautiful.Flaws are beautiful.	in my views its the one and only TAJ MAHAL...this was built as a sign of someones love to her..and love is the only thing eternal which can be felt even at the place where you cant measure time distance ,but you can feel love..love - all religions and almighty Godgiven message to spread love and this TAJ MAHAL is a sign of that..rest of the things are constructed using latest technology and if we think about the time of TAJ,what technology was at that time? no doubt it takes lots of human labour, long time for completion of work ,history of workers (as it is heard that workers hands were cut by the emperor) this history is unique and no one had history like this.its beauty is ultimate which inspire people and message everyone the most prminent love-to love and to spread love..what we need to do ..
what are the most important things for living a good life	why should i live	0	What is a good life?To me, a good life is living where you are able to wake up everyday in anticipation and excitement for what's to come. Material success and artificial sensations wouldn't mean a thing. Compassion, love, and generosity would be the aim.A good life is one where you aim to make a positive mark on the world you live in.With that considered, I would say the following things are necessary to maintain a good life:Self-sufficiency: How else can you live a good life when you are stuck under the grace of others? Wouldn't that cause anxiety and frustration? Manage yourself. It has to be necessary.Desire to learn new things: A good life is one filled with the constant gain of knowledge. You have to desire to learn more and grow otherwise you're missing the point.Strong focus on your passions: You can use your passion in your own way. Concentrate on it. It's what can give you a life purpose - which is very important.Travel: People say that travel isn't for everyone, but I personally believe it's essential. It's one of the few ways you can meet people who are just like you and very different from you at the same time. You have a big world below your feet. Take advantage of it!It all sounds idealistic, but you make your own life.	Instead of answering this question straightaway,I would like you to read this story first.I hope you will have got your answer after reading it ! :)You were on your way home when you died. It was a car accident. Nothing particularly remarkable, but fatal nonetheless. You left behind a wife and two children. It was a painless death. The EMTs tried their best to save you, but to no avail. Your body was so utterly shattered you were better off, trust me. And that’s when you met me. “What… what happened?” You asked. “Where am I?”“You died,” I said, matter-of-factly. No point in mincing words. “There was a… a truck and it was skidding…”“Yup,” I said.“I… I died?”“Yup. But don’t feel bad about it. Everyone dies,” I said.You looked around. There was nothingness. Just you and me. “What is this place?” You asked. “Is this the afterlife?”“More or less,” I said. “Are you god?” You asked.“Yup,” I replied. “I’m God.”“My kids… my wife,” you said. “What about them?”“Will they be all right?” “That’s what I like to see,” I said. “You just died and your main concern is for your family. That’s good stuff right there.”You looked at me with fascination. To you, I didn’t look like God. I just looked like some man. Or possibly a woman. Some vague authority figure, maybe. More of a grammar school teacher than the almighty. “Don’t worry,” I said. “They’ll be fine. Your kids will remember you as perfect in every way. They didn’t have time to grow contempt for you. Your wife will cry on the outside, but will be secretly relieved. To be fair, your marriage was falling apart. If it’s any consolation, she’ll feel very guilty for feeling relieved.”“Oh,” you said. “So what happens now? Do I go to heaven or hell or something?”“Neither,” I said. “You’ll be reincarnated.”“Ah,” you said. “So the Hindus were right,”“All religions are right in their own way,” I said. “Walk with me.”You followed along as we strode through the void. “Where are we going?”“Nowhere in particular,” I said. “It’s just nice to walk while we talk.”“So what’s the point, then?” You asked. “When I get reborn, I’ll just be a blank slate, right? A baby. So all my experiences and everything I did in this life won’t matter.”“Not so!” I said. “You have within you all the knowledge and experiences of all your past lives. You just don’t remember them right now.”I stopped walking and took you by the shoulders. “Your soul is more magnificent, beautiful, and gigantic than you can possibly imagine. A human mind can only contain a tiny fraction of what you are. It’s like sticking your finger in a glass of water to see if it’s hot or cold. You put a tiny part of yourself into the vessel, and when you bring it back out, you’ve gained all the experiences it had.“You’ve been in a human for the last 48 years, so you haven’t stretched out yet and felt the rest of your immense consciousness. If we hung out here for long enough, you’d start remembering everything. But there’s no point to doing that between each life.”“How many times have I been reincarnated, then?”“Oh lots. Lots and lots. An in to lots of different lives.” I said. “This time around, you’ll be a Chinese peasant girl in 540 AD.”“Wait, what?” You stammered. “You’re sending me back in time?”“Well, I guess technically. Time, as you know it, only exists in your universe. Things are different where I come from.”“Where you come from?” You said.“Oh sure,” I explained “I come from somewhere. Somewhere else. And there are others like me. I know you’ll want to know what it’s like there, but honestly you wouldn’t understand.”“Oh,” you said, a little let down. “But wait. If I get reincarnated to other places in time, I could have interacted with myself at some point.”“Sure. Happens all the time. And with both lives only aware of their own lifespan you don’t even know it’s happening.”“So what’s the point of it all?”“Seriously?” I asked. “Seriously? You’re asking me for the meaning of life? Isn’t that a little stereotypical?”“Well it’s a reasonable question,” you persisted.I looked you in the eye. “The meaning of life, the reason I made this whole universe, is for you to mature.”“You mean mankind? You want us to mature?”“No, just you. I made this whole universe for you. With each new life you grow and mature and become a larger and greater intellect.”“Just me? What about everyone else?”“There is no one else,” I said. “In this universe, there’s just you and me.” You stared blankly at me. “But all the people on earth…”“All you. Different incarnations of you.”“Wait. I’m everyone!?”“Now you’re getting it,” I said, with a congratulatory slap on the back. “I’m every human being who ever lived?”“Or who will ever live, yes.”“I’m Abraham Lincoln?”“And you’re John Wilkes Booth, too,” I added.“I’m Hitler?” You said, appalled.“And you’re the millions he killed.”“I’m Jesus?”“And you’re everyone who followed him.”You fell silent. “Every time you victimized someone,” I said, “you were victimizing yourself. Every act of kindness you’ve done, you’ve done to yourself. Every happy and sad moment ever experienced by any human was, or will be, experienced by you.”You thought for a long time. “Why?” You asked me. “Why do all this?”“Because someday, you will become like me. Because that’s what you are. You’re one of my kind. You’re my child.”“Whoa,” you said, incredulous. “You mean I’m a god?”“No. Not yet. You’re a fetus. You’re still growing. Once you’ve lived every human life throughout all time, you will have grown enough to be born.”“So the whole universe,” you said, “it’s just…”“An egg.” I answered. “Now it’s time for you to move on to your next life.”And I sent you on your way.
what is the meaning and purpose to life	what is the exact meaning of life	1	"To those who haven't traveled in an non air-conditioned railway coach (generally referred to as a sleeper coach) in India, I apologize for my choice of metaphor here. To give a bit of a background, more than half the reserved coaches in India are non-AC. They are generally messier, filthier, hotter, more crowded, and generally more of an unpleasant experience than their air conditioned counterparts.Imagine such a journey. You board the train at 8 AM in the morning, settle down, and feel yourself being slowly engulfed with excitement and hopeful anticipation. It is going to be a long trip; 24 hours to be precise. But the prospect of going back to your hometown, or seeing your lover after a long time, or starting a new chapter in a strange city, or any of the multitude of reasons you undertook this voyage, would certainly make up for it. Its almost noon. Things have been smooth for the past 4 hours. The weather's fine, but it is definitely getting hotter. Your coach is only ~50% occupied. You have already finished the book you had purchased earlier, at the onset of the journey. To be fair, it was a disappointment. However, it did help you kill a few hours. But you are no longer in the mood to read more, so you do not take out the second one, letting it sit idly in your backpack, hopefully to be picked up during the return leg.The first big station arrives. A great human wave overwhelms your compartment. In a few minutes, when the commotion subsides, and the train resumes nonchalantly, you realize that there are now more people than seats. A lot of people without the proper reservations have also got in. But being in India, there is nothing much you can do about it. An elderly gentleman comes up to you and asks you to shift a bit to accommodate him. You are well within your rights to refuse, but you don't want to sound rude. So you comply; you adjust. Another 3 hours pass by. The heat has become unbearable. You curse our little, ordinary, yellow star. You notice that another young man has somehow sneaked into your seat. Originally meant to seat 3, it now is carrying 5. There isn't enough room for you to get comfortable. Not fair, you think. After all you planned your travel in advance and paid for the seat. So you take a stand, and politely ask the gentleman to leave. It's 6 PM now. The sun has started to go down. You have become accustomed to the crowd, the crying children, the noisy group of teenagers in the next compartment, and everything else. The guy you had asked to leave earlier comes back, walks up to you, and apologizes. He is a student, who had to suddenly leave for home due to a personal emergency. He says his stop is next. And that he is terribly sorry for the inconvenience he caused you. You feel like an ass. You realize you had been a terrible person. You blurt out your apology too, hoping to make up for your earlier blunder. You offer him half you seat until his journey ends. You start talking. He is a good kid. 30 minutes or so fly by in what felt like a jiffy. You bid adieu but not without adding him on Facebook. You just made a friend. 7 PM and you are gazing our of the window. The cool counter-breeze is a welcome relief after the sun's unsolicited display of strength earlier that day. The scenery is wonderful too. Lush green fields, small lakes and ponds, a tiny creek, a rustic little settlement. You can almost feel the languid rural life calling out to you, a stark contrast against the hectic pace of the city. Is that regret you are feeling?Anyway, back to the present. Some of the scenery is so beautiful, you wish you could stop and admire it for a few moments more. But like Frost's reminiscence of a fateful winter evening passing through the woods, or Wordsworth's vivid memoirs of gazing upon a daffodil field, you know it isn't possible. Everything comes, stays for a while, and then leaves. Nothing is permanent. With that thought, both distressing and comforting, you eat your dinner and go to sleep. You wake up at 6 AM the next morning, mostly infuriated by the commotion in the coach. To your pleasant surprise, you find a cute girl sitting across from your seat. Being shy, you simply take out the second book and start reading. A few minutes later, the lady interrupts you inquiring about the said book. Not a bad investment, you think. One thing leads to another, and you soon find yourself in the midst of a wonderful conversation. You are pleasantly surprised to discover that the two of you work in the same city, belong to the same town, and have overlapping interests in most cases. ""Could this be love?"", you heart asks. ""Let's not get ahead of ourselves."", your brain replies. However, it definitely could be the beginning of something wonderful. You exchange numbers and outline some vague plans to catch up soon.The journey is coming to an end. You feel both relieved and a bit nostalgic. You are where you wanted to be, but in the process you will have to let go of the past 24 hours. That is life. A journey. A series of events, some memorable some not. An emotional roller-coaster of joy, sadness, excitement, disappointment. A constant battle between being a little sympathetic and understanding vs standing your ground. Friendship. Love. An elapsing sequence of scenes, of moments, of memories. All of them fleeting. Permanently. Irrevocably. The final destination for all is the same - irrespective of power, wealth, beauty, ambition. Death is the eventual finality that we all need to embrace and accept. However, it's the ephemeral nanosecond in the cosmic calendar, where you exist, that is all that matters.

Here’s The Right FoodSea food Salmon, tuna and shrimps are the healthy way to gain weight. Consume 2 portions of salmon every day. Salmon is protein rich, and increases weight too. Shrimps are packed with necessary fatty acid content, which fill your body with healthy calories. Tuna consists of vital fatty acid which contains healthy fats. This is good for gaining weight and maintaining a good physique.Milk Products Dairy products like full fat milk, cheese and butter are a good way to gain nutrients and weight.

Corn bread is also a good option, as it is also loaded with carbs and approximately 328 calories.Dry Fruits, Nuts and Seeds A good source of good calories and energy, nuts and seeds help in increasing weight. So munch on dry fruits, trails instead of fresh fruits. Consuming dry fruits helps you in gaining calories quickly, apart from providing adequate nutrients. While seeds and nuts consist of healthy calories, polyunsaturated fats are the one that help in. So add almonds, walnuts and pumpkin seeds in your daily diet. You can also have granola bar, packed with 500 calories it is loaded with nuts and seeds.Peanut Butter The yummy salty and soft spread on bread is the best to have in breakfast. Peanut butter consists of approx 192 calories and proteins, and is one of the best to increase weight. Eat calorie dense food to gain weight with proper nutrients. So have a peanut and whole wheat bread toast with whole egg in tomorrow’s breakfast.Fruits and Juices Fruit juice is packed with calories and is a good energy booster too. But remember always consume 100 percent fruit juice packed with sugar and nutrients. You can also go for a fruit like banana, packed with 100 calories, it is rich in nutrients and carbs too. So if you want to gain weight, banana and a glass of whole fruit juice are a must on your breakfast menu.

why is saltwater taffy candy imported in china	why is saltwater taffy candy imported in laos	1	Why is salt water taffy candy imported in the United Kingdom?Is it? Never seen it anywhere. I only know the term from old Scooby Doo episodes.We don't have the word “Taffy” here, so if anyone wants taffy (rather than toffee or fudge), they would need to make it or import it.I asked an American living here what it was and I seem to remember she said it was softer than toffee, but not the same as fudge. If so, it might be different enough to import some, but probably not different enough to displace those two very popular types of traditional sweets*. If there aren't many people who want it, its unlikely to be economic to make it here. Especially if part of its appeal is in being a traditional american sweet.*I like bonfire toffee the best. You could definitely break a tooth on it though!	Why is salt water taffy candy imported in the United Kingdom?Is it? Never seen it anywhere.

is there a different price over the internet than in person when trying to book a room in mexico city from america	why is mexico city dangerous	0	Thanks for your request to answer: Is there a different price over the Internet than in person when trying to book a room in Mexico City from the US?Nowadays there are different prices, for the same thing, every moment, everytime, all the time.Generally speaking in the hospitality business, if you book in advance…and, booking online generally implies “in advance”, you will get much better rates than walking into an hotel a making a booking (unless they know you or you are some sort of especial client). The walk-in rates are usually called the “rack rates” for a hotel and are commonly the highest for that particular type of hotel and for each particular type of room the have/offer.Now, there is an art and science called “Targeted pricing” in which prices of a certain item can vary A LOT depending on many many many different circumstances and parameters: You could get into a site, check the price of whatever you want, then come back 3 (three, just to say a number) minutes later and the price could be different. Or, you could check the price from Mexico and get a number and check it at the same time from the US and be a totally different number. Or, if you check it in the morning may be different if you check it on night time… And, you, as the customer may not perceive this changes to be consistent to ANYTHING… this is because there are thounsands of parameters being evaluated by the computers of your vendor and presenting the most convenient pricing to the potential customers as to maximize revenue to that business.That is why, when for instance you book an airplane seat and maybe you could have paid USD$100 (again as an example number) and the person sitting next to you could have paid $5,000 for pretty much the same seat as you, on the same day, same route and in theory the same class of service.There are no written rules about pricing. Call the hotel and ask for their price, if you like it book it, but not before being maybe at the very same time online and checking the prices not only at the very same hotel’s web site..but also at some other web sites specialized in that hotels subjet, to name a few:Booking.com: The largest selection of hotels, homes, and vacation rentalsHotels.com - Earn Free Nights on Cheap Hotels Near YouVacations, Cheap Flights, Airline Tickets & AirfaresVacations, Cheap Flights, Airline Tickets & Airfaresand many more …(Yes, I noticed two of the above links print the same line, one I wrote is EXPEDIA and the other is ORBITZ…which now are the same company, but different web sites)Good luck, safe and fun travels !	I have a section of a speech, in which I say “for you gringos in the audience, don’t go to Johannesburg and try this yourself.”The “try this” is, essentially, walking in any of the public market areas in poor neighborhoods to the northeast of the city center, where they would be the only white person within many blocks, but really stand out like a sore thumb due to demeanor and expectations.That section of my presentation ends with “I really love being there, because you can forget all the pressures of thinking about race in the US.” But of course, most of the US-American whites in my audience, would get themselves robbed or killed on those streets.They’d do it by not fitting it. They’d do it not, by not fitting in by the color of their skin— but by how they act, their demeanor, the constant arrogance, the assertiveness and assumptions of their body language, stance and movements. They’d do it by not recognizing others, and being 100% oblivious to who is carrying a deadly weapon— and for that matter, 100% oblivious to what a deadly weapon can be, on the streets of a place like Joburg.Mexico City gets a bad rap. Statistically, since 2002 or so, Mexico City is much safer than the urban United States. Roughly, about twice as safe. Even before then, the sensationalization of violence in Mexico by the United States, was also a matter of racism and nationalism.One of the other respondent below, points out an aspect of Mexican culture and violence that is very important but rarely noted: the nature of race in Mexico.If you look and act like like a conquistadore, in some situations you may will receive a great deal of deference and respect. In others, you will be resented. Step into a local neighborhood filled with the descendants of the Aztecs at dusk, and you may find yourself re-enacting a ritual sacrifice, as the guest of honour. (Heck its a bit more complex, but there’s no time for a lecture on ritual grammar and the nature of tamales in Nahuatl.)Another thing many US-Americans may miss, is that as ‘gringos’ [note, the foregoing is a potential racially derisive term, and not being used in that sense] they are not usually on top of the racial hierarchy. The descendants of the Aztecs tend to look at their culture as number One. The Spanish conquistadores are number Two. And in the third culture which resulted, being identified as the second, can mean you’re on top of society— most of Mexico’s power and wealth is controlled by about twenty families — or it can mean, you’re a hostile invader to be expelled or killed.Complex, isn’t it? We’re just scratching the surface. For many in Mexico today, the United States and its material and other successes, are something to be looked up to and aspired to. For many others, the United States is a terrible place, filled with cold temperatures and colder people, an exploitative imperial aggressor responsible for much of Mexico’s poverty and decline.Just scratching the surface. There is little time or space here, to spend on the ideas and ideology of socialist Mexico and the Mexican left— that the United States is a capitalist aggressor, on the one hand, and that Mexico’s schools should only teach literature and self-development, not science and industry, so that students won’t become cogs in the capitalist machine.But the latter, too, has much to do with cycles of poverty and violence, the stalls of Latin American economies, and the failures of all sides to move forward.But “why is Mexico City so violent”?Why is Memphis Tennessee so violent? Why is New Orleans so violent? Why are Baltimore and Philadelphiaso violent? Why is West Oaklandso violent? Why are US-American films, and television, so violent?And why do US-Americans go on so about the problems of other places, when their own problems are so much worse?

which were some of the most amazing responses you have got with cortana siri or amazon echo	what are some of the most amazing concepts given by theoretical physicists which cannot be proved in reality or are too advanced to prove with available resourcestechnologies	0	I had shared an idea with my organisation about “The Latest Feedback box” through which we can know about the views of the general people but I haven’t got a good response. This Latest Feedback box will help to know the ideas of general people and we can take Instant Decisions to make their desire fulfill. The Latest feedback box is a Platform where we can share our ideas, give complains from anywhere in the world. It is the simplest way to make your ideas get good responses. The Government of Dubai also use an Idea sharing platform named “Eideabox” to get suggestions and ideas by their people.	Certainly most assertions of String Theory are untestable. The extra dimensions it asserts are curled so tightly -- smaller than the diameter of a proton -- that we just don't have the ability to probe them.It's like beings in a one-dimensional universe postulating that instead of a line, their universe is actually a cylinder, and they are actually two-dimensional beings wrapped around it. But it's so small in diameter, that their universe is indistinguishable from a line.There are also theories that postulate that gravity is leaking into or out of our universe from other dimensions. This one is especially frustrating, because the distance at which this begins to happen is actually on the order of a visible fraction of a millimeter. We can actually see with our naked eye the scale at which gravity is thought to begin leaking. But gravity is so weak that we don't have the ability to measure it at such small -- even though they're visible -- distances. At the distances we're talking about, other forces come into play, making measurement of gravity pretty much impossible.Membrane Theory suggests that there are perhaps innumerable parallel universes of varying dimensions in an arbitrarily high-dimension realm. Each universe is a membrane, and ours just happens to be three spatial dimensions. When another membrane collided with ours almost 14 billion years ago, that provided the quantum disturbance that created the Big Bang.The quantum multiverse theory suggests that for every quantum probability wave collapse that has occurred, there is another universe for every possible wave collapse that could otherwise have happened. So if an electron is seen to exist in this spot here, there is another set of universes in which the electron is seen to exist somewhere else. And so on. On the macro scale, this means that for every fork in the road you encounter, every decision you make, there is another universe in which you made a different choice. But it's so mind-bogglingly much more than that since it's governed at the subatomic level for every particle in the entire universe, and not at the macro level. In effect, it says that every universe that can possibly exist from this moment on, does exist somewhere. But, alas, we might never gain the ability to test this since other universes are spectacularly inaccessible.Wormholes, or Einstein-Rosen Bridges, seem to be allowed by General Relativity. And General Relativity has proven to be incredibly successful at making predictions that turned out to be spot-on accurate. So few physicists doubt that wormholes are possible in our universe.But creating them requires god-like command of mind-boggling quantities of matter and energy. This one is rather cool, because most of us believe that wormholes are something the universe actually allows.Alas.

Yes, I believe that respect is something which will earn you value of being alive but money is what you need actually for begin alive! This is not a question that philosophy can answer! This is quite practical matter!Without respect, with lot of money, we can't live a satisfactory life! And without money, with lot of respect, same is true! Yes, practically respect can help you to earn money! But that will itch your self-respect a bit, which is not satisfying! Without any respect in the world, you will feel like a thing, so having lot of money can help you to survive but it will not help you to live happily!In my opinion, hardwork and honesty is more important than both money and respect! Hardwork will earn you money and honesty will earn you respect! But the answer to your question is both are not helpful without eachother!

should the indian education system be changed	do we need to change the  education system of india if yes then why	1	Should Education system be changed? yesHow?Answer:Remove English education completely: English was introduced by the British Raj, as a way to degrade our patriotism towards our own country, but after the damage caused by Mughal and British invasion, our Prakrit and Sanskrit education system was dumped, and even after 1947 independence we had no choice but to introduce English as ‘Link language’ as Indian states are divided by languages. English is a foreign language, it does not share or care about the Indian culture, you cannot discriminate people respectively like “Tu, Tum, Ap” in Hindi, and other languages, english is completely different.Introduce a new national language, such as Sanskrit: Sanskrit and Prakrit was always used in Ancient India, Brahmins made the most progress. For Example: Aryabhatta did all his works in Sanskrit(this is a fact). Sanskrit included the entire Hindu culture in a language, Making Sanskrit compulsory in all classes and even higher classes will help the students in knowing the national more efficiently.Remove british history and Mughal history, and introduce the might of the Indian emperors, their strength and wealth: British did their best to make us feel bad about our history, hence they introduced what caused our rulers fail to protect our own country.Make moral science as a subject compulsory till Class 8: Although this is already being followed in many school this is essential too.Re-Develop the Class rooms and provide appropriate maintenance: One of the basic infrastructural needs, if the schools are already hygienic, then it will simply attract students, except of repelling them.

what are the multiple uses of hollow columns	what is the standard size of a column for building	0	Hollow columns are mostly used while constructing bridges. They are preferred to solid columns as they have less seismic mass, and thus make the superstructure comparatively safer.Also, this type of structural member may be, in some cases,economically viable when compared to usual solid members. Their applications include large bridge columns andpiles as well as offshore platforms. This structural type was in fact extensively used in Europe and in Japan sincethe early seventies. The economical convenience in the use of hollow columns is due to the cost saving affordedby reduced section area (up to 70%). Also, hollow columns are more efficient than solid ones from a structuralpoint of view. When the weight of the vertical members is relevant in the performance of the entire structure, asignificant reduction in the seismic mass may be attained by using this structural type.	First of all , the question is which type of column you are using timber , concrete etc .Now a days RCC columns are widely used ,here is the detail about it.The size of the columns depends on the total load on the columns.Minimum size of the column should not be less than 9”x9”.9”x9” columns are to be used for a single storey structure with M15 (1:2:4) (cement : sand : aggregate ) grade of concrete.In case, 9”x9” column size is to be used for 1 and half storey structure, then it is advised to use M20 (1:1.5:3) (cement : sand : aggregate ) grade concrete.A safe and structurally sound column size for a 1 and half storey structure should not be less than 12”x9” using M15 grade concrete. This should be in your most preferred and practical options list.Distance between the columnsTry to maintain equal distance between the centres of two columns. Always plan a column layout on a grid.The distance between two columns of size 9”x9” should not be more than 4m centre to centre of column.If larger barrier free distances are required then going for larger column size is to be used.The size of the columns increase because of two factors:1 . Increase in the distance between two columns (This increases the dimensions of the columns as well the depth of the beam.)2 . Height of the building (Increase in the number of floors is directly proportional to the dimensions of the columns.Alignment of ColumnsA rectangular grid is to be made for placing the columns. This helps in avoiding mistakes and placing in columns can be done in the right way.The columns can preferably be arranged in two different fashions:1 . In a straight line with the help of a grid2 . In a circular fashion for circular buildings.Zigzag arrangement of columns is an absolutely wrong way of working out Structural design. It should be remembered that when columns are erected, beams are laid connecting the columns.The Zigzag column placement causes three major issues:1 . Unbalanced load transfer2 . Problems in wall construction3 . Problems in laying beams (This picture shows a rough design of columns for multistory buildings )

(Wrong)The correct form should beWe have returned from office or school (right)The basic different which lies between “come” and return”:-We use the word “return” where we had already gone to a place and that we are returning from there.While on the other hand, the word “come” is used when none such an action takes place.For example, we can sayMy friend will come to house on my birthday (correct)Here, if we use the word “return” for them, then it is going to be wrongLikeMy friend will return to my house on birthday. (Wrong)Hope, you have got the basic difference from the two words “come” and “return”Read : How do toppers study and how do I need to studyLet’s take a look at the other mistakes which we often tend to do.We often compliment something or the other if we felt good. However, rarely do we use the most importance word during such times,For example, we shouldn’t say thatThe food is good (wrong)The food is tasty, sumptuous, mouthwatering or delicious (You can use any one amongst these four for food)We shouldn’t sayThe match was good (wrong)The correct form isThe match was interesting, electrifying etc.Read : How to get bank Jobs fast after 12th and Graduation in Govt or Pvt sectorSimilarly, if we want to compliment any girl, we use “beautiful” while for boys we use “handsome”.These are some of small things which matters a lot in the long run.Apart from these, one of the other things which you need to start preparing yourself is about Active and Passive VoiceIn the world of blogging, there are so many cases when we do not know the proper way to say a thing. In such cases we can make the use of Passive voice.For exampleThe lion killed the dear (Active Voice)The dear is killed by the lion (Passive Voice)As a blogger cum writer, if you are told to re-write a certain paragraph, then you can easily make the best use of this knowledge.My experienceOne of my other experiences which I am sharing in the post relates to the time when I was in class 3rd. I still remember that the teacher asked me about my hobbies and I said “Computer”. She corrected me by saying that it should be“I love playing on computer”or“I love working on computer”Similarly, those who love music, when being asked about their hobbies, they should say that they “love listening music”.Same goes with other hobbies as well.I am going to further furnish more knowledgeable posts, which will make your journey of writing as well as speaking English easy like never before.In all the earlier posts, I have been trying my level best to tell you intricacies as well in order to help you further.Grammar is regarded to be the backbone without which you possibly can’t polish the English skills. Hence, make sure that you are well versed with the tenses.English is all about learning the intricacies. One of the most common mistakes which people commit while making the use of “older” and “elder”Both the term means that you are younger to the other person. However, both of them are used in different ways. For example,He is older to me (correct)My brother is older to me (Wrong)Now, I am explaining to you.We use “elder” with those people who have blood relations with us. While for others we use “older”I am going to give you another example in order to help you understand in a better way.I am elder to my cousin brother. (correct)My friend’s father is older to him. (correct)Hope, you have got the difference between the two.Another most common mistake which people mistake pertaining to 12o’ clockIf it’s day time, then we will be saying, It’s 12 noon and if its 12 at night, then it’s 12 midnight.One simply cannot say 12 am o...
why is it that every teen girl has a crush on her mathematics teacher is it the intelligence or their behavior	do girls get crushes on their male teachers	0	Every teen girl? Come on now.You’re referring to an entire age range of 13–19 and you think that every girl in this age range harbours a secret crush on their math teacher?While I don’t rule out the possibility that some of them definitely can have a crush on their math teacher, I also feel a substantially large number of them probably thinks Justin Bieber or Zayn Malik is way cooler than their math teacher ever will be.As for the second question, which only pertains to those who do have a crush on their math teacher, the answer is probably a yes (i.e. either their intelligence or their behavior) but I feel compelled to point that you have left out a third possibility: that the math teacher, among other things, is extremely good-looking.Or did you think only boys dig good looks?	Yeah, generally they do!But it also depends upon a lot of factors.With growing age these things lose their importance and appears to be absurd.Having crush on your teacher nowhere means that you have forgotten all your moral values or else your teacher is too sexy in his looks. When I was in school, there were 18 girls in my class and out of them 15 had a crush on the same english teacher. I was one of them :p And the reason behind it was his chemistry with all the students, his way of dealing the situations, the depth to which he taught us the literature part was epic! He was 45 years old at that time. And our age was around 15. The attraction was just a result of our innocent age and his kind, supportive and genuine nature And we ALL RESPECT HIM A LOT.
is it too late to go to medical school and become a doctor	is it too late to go to medical school at 24	1	No, if you can get in you probably have what it takes intellectually and, honestly, a few extra years of life experience probably helps as well with maturity, communicating with patients and colleagues, etc.The major issue with starting at an older age is the increased responsibilities that tend to come along with it (e.g., spouse, children, mortgage, etc.) and time and stress management. Med school is pretty intense and residency is more intense so that’s 7 to 11+ years (depending on specialty and if you do a fellowship) of heavy studying, long hours and low pay.It becomes your life. You have to love it.I started an MD/PhD program at 25 (finished at 32) and then did a 3 year postdoc (age 35) and then matched in neurosurgery (additional 7 years). I left residency to launch my oncology startup but otherwise I would have finished this year at age 42.In my med school class there were maybe 10% who didn’t come straight from undergrad and 1 who was in her 40s (single, no kids). There were also a handful of married students and they formed a support group along with their spouses. All of them are now practicing.I still think regardless of age the 3 most important things that determine success in med school/residency/practice are 1) location (don’t move to a city you hate or can’t afford, being close to family/friends helps too), 2) cost of tuition (I wouldn’t pay extra for ivy league or private school if you plan on being a private primary care doc), and 3) the people you surround yourself with (maintaining friendships/hobbies, supportive spouse, study groups, support groups, having positive clinical mentors).Good luck!

what is the effect of hypodensity of white matter in parietal lobe of brain	how do i increase grey matter in the brain	0	The reason why your question cannot be answered OUT OF CONTEXT, i.e. as BOTH the report and all pertinent clinical history are absent, because the T2 hyperintense focus in the left frontal lobe is described as non-specific. I recommend, OP, that you look up this term if you’re not familiar with it.A reasonable approach to obtaining as close to one possible answer as possible is by asking the Physician who ordered this MRI study.	Grey matter is neurons, the cell bodies, and very few axons. White matter is the opposite with mostly myelinated axons. You can’t grow new neurons, you were born with nearly all the neurons you will ever have. Only a small number are produced in specific sites like the Hippocampus.So, grey matter can only decrease? nooooot exactly. The cell bodies are only a part of grey matter. Increases in dendrite branching (the receiving end of neurons) can increase grey matter, without needing new neurons. Existing neurons making more connection would technically also result in more grey matter. Then again, more water in the area would also show up as an increase, but let’s assume researchers took this error into account.In this study they found Enhanced functional connectivity and increased gray matter volume of insula related to action video game playing. Video games improve your brain? yeah, but not just video games, any repetitive, skill-based tasks (sports, painting, and driving) will do. These activities will make new connections as you practice, leading not only to better connectivity but also increases in grey matter. So go out and do something, practice, do sports, enjoy a hobby, use that brain and don’t worry about it. If you are asking for a specific skill (e.g. you want to do math better) then practice that skill. The brain changes as you get better, you don’t get better by changing your brain.Do note, this isn’t permanent. These type of changes are part of the plasticity of our brain. If you stop using it the connection will weaken and your grey matter will shrink to its original state.
what is your job and your salary are you satisfied with your current job	my iq is currently 83 can i get a high paying job or ever get a six figure salary job	0	Age - 25Current job - NTPC limitedQualification - BTECH NIT TRICHY with a CGPA of 9.04 (mechanical engg)Salary - 12.3 lpa CTC ( 58.2k inhand, free medical, laptop, mobile, bills, accomodation and the list goes on)I am very much happy and satisfied that I chose NTPC out of (ntpc,iocl,bpcl and ongc). Reason being the kind of work culture, people around you and yeah a year long training program which is indeed alot of fun. I joined NTPC in sep 2016. I had my technical training at ntpc simhadri for 3.5 months which was power plant familiarisation. The classes started at 10 am and continued till 1 pm. Then lunch break for two hours and then again a two hour session and then you can go to gym, play tennis, go for swimming and what not. People working in ntpc are really happy and satisfied with their lives and job. Right now I am in Noida undergoing management module for 2.5 months. I went for Outborne training in TEHRI for a week which was fantabulous we did tree climbing,valley crossing, trekking, rafting etc etc. I love this company to the core and would have spent my life here if it was not for a UPSC job :-P.After training we are posted to our locations where we are supposed to sit in an air conditioned control room and work from there. Only problem is that you have to work in shifts which changes in every two days. Two days morning shift(6–2) next two day afternoon(2–10) and post that night shift (10–6). Night shift being the most difficult,then you have a day off and then general shift where you do have to attend a meeting for an hour or so. So it is 6 days work and 2 days off (considering one hour general shift as off :P). You do have alot of holidays (30 earned leave, 12 casual leaves, 6 restricted holidays, 20 half paid leaves, 16 leaves for working on saturdays and plus 10 more leaves for the same purpose and is encashable). You have to work for 8 hours after that you are free to pursue your hobby. You do get a variable pay of around 1.2 lakhs per annum. You do get 60k for laptop, 40k for pc ,10 k for mobiles, briefcase allowance,spectacle allowance, free medical in hospitals like apollo and fortis, free accomodation in townships etc etc. If you enjoy city life more, then this company is not for you. As you will be posted in remotest location of the country where even flipkart delivery is not possible forget about malls, multiplex, dominos,pizza hut etc etc. But you can enjoy your life and your family can live a peaceful life.So why am i leaving ntpc?I was attracted towards GROUP A services in India since I was 6 yrs old (I am serious :P). I always wanted to be a class one officer. I have cleared ESE 2016 with an AIR 62,was expecting a far better rank but things got ruined. Everything in your life doesn’t go as you have planned. Wanted to join indian railways but will end up with indian ordnance factory services IOFS.Am i happy?Yes, I am very happy with IOFS there are several reasons for it listed below-It is not as hectic as indian railways where you always need to be on your toes. You can take leaves easily. Iofs is a (8–6) job with two hour lunch break :P.With more authorities comes more responsibilities. In railways you are heading more than 700 people at the very first posting and believe me handling people is very difficult. Handling machines is rather very easy. They won’t judge you,they wont talk behind your back. In IOFS I will be handling a staff of around 100–150 people which is good enough.I would be posted as an Assistant director in ministry of defence. Sounds good right :-P. I would have my own cabin with IES written below my name. I will have a stenographer for doing the typing stuffs.I will get military canteen facillities, will get a 2 BHK accomodation, will get all my bills reimbursed and a inhand salary of around 53–54k during training (15 months training :P) and around 62k after training though far le...	If your IQ is truly 83 it seems unlikely you would have been able to write this question as clearly and accurately as you have. My guess would be that whatever measure you used is wrong. If you can write this well, it seems likely you could get a job and move up, whether to six figures or not is a question any job seeker might ask, but persistence and study definitely help get you there.

what is the opera song with a choir used for horror movies	what are an opera choir  rights do we get paid for rehearsals are we entitled to catering throughout rehearsals etc part of an opera company	0	You're probably thinking of Carmina Burana by the composer Carl Orff, although the work is actually a vocal cantata, not an opera.  The most commonly used section from Carmina Burana that you'll hear in the movies is O Fortuna, although it's use is not limited to horror movies.  I'm not totally sure about this, but I strongly suspect that its use is much more common in horror movie trailers than in horror movies themselves.  This is because movie trailers are often made before the soundtrack of a film is completed.  The O Fortuna section from Carmina Burana is so ridiculously popular in movie trailers that it's practically a cliché by now, horror movie trailers included.  Here's a clip of what O Fortuna sounds like so you can check if it's what you're looking for: There's also a Wikipedia page Carl Orff's O Fortuna in popular culture that may also provide you with some more answers you are looking for.  According to the Wikipedia page, the earliest horror movie trailer anybody can find with Carl Orff's O Fortuna on it is for the 1990 Canadian B movie Cursed.	I'm part of a tech start-up that is developing a social networking application for iphone and android...sort of a cross between foursquare and Twitter meets Facebook. We are not currently with an active product, but mostly want to register the company so that we may attain its name before it is taken. What form of corporation is right for the time being?
would a woman in the catholic church be shunned or ostracized for having a sexual relationship with a priest	what would happen if a woman sued the catholic church for not allowing them to become a priest	0	There is no easy answer to this. It all depends on the parish and circumstances involved.I know of parishes where it is an open secret that the priest is in a relationship with someone (male or female) and the parish is quite happy with it because the priest is much loved. Most Catholics in Germany think the requirements for priestly celibacy should be dropped, and are thus understanding of priests having such relationships.There are also cases where a priest is married (because he was originally a non-Roman Catholic clergyman) and it often is seen as quite positive.Nonetheless the teachings of the Roman Catholic Church are clear and the hierarchy adamant. While some bishops are willing to turn a blind eye to such relationships, others very definitely are not, and some churchgoers are more than happy to blow the whistle. It can result in a painful crisis for all involved and it is not something anyone should take lightly. The end result is not necessarily ostracism per se — but it does mean the priest will eventually lose his vocation in the Roman Catholic Church. The partner may well face a lot of anger from others for his/her role in this as well. The shock of losing a priest in this way can tear a parish to pieces and cause immense grief.Nearly always the priest is forced to give up his license (technically he remains a priest but is banned from providing sacraments, typically getting a job if he is lucky in pastoral care) or they leave the Roman Catholic Church to become Anglican/Episcopal or Old Catholic. Most Old Catholic priests in Europe are former Roman Catholic priests, and there is a waiting list of Roman priests wanting to join, very often (but not always) with this very scenario as the primary reason.So such a relationship will probably not result in outright ostracism, but it won’t be a walk in the park, either. It almost certainly ends with the priest’s career in ruins and a lot of angry, hurt, disappointed people around the two of them. All the more reason I think the policy should change, if I may say so, but until it does this sort of thing will continue.	In the U.S., it would be thrown out due to what’s called the “ministerial exemption” from various non-discrimination laws (which is a statutory exemption, but is also compelled by the Constitution). Basically, every faith has absolute discretion to decide who will and will not be a minister of that faith.If it happened in a country that didn’t recognize that fundamental right, and if the court did order the Church to ordain the woman (or at least enroll her in seminary with the goal of eventual ordination)… then the Church would refuse to comply, and would face whatever penalty or persecution may occur.Our doctrines are not subject to civil authority. No court on Earth has jurisdiction over the laws of Heaven.
if a canadian gets a tattoo in america do they have to declare the cost when returning to canada	i am a canadian pr that just finished studying in america i got offered an h1b should i take the offer or return to canada	0	Was that the sole purpose of your visit? If so, that's cool.According to the CBSA website, No duty is payable on goods imported for personal use, if it is marked as “made in Canada, the USA, or Mexico”, or if there is no marking or labelling indicating that it was made somewhere other than Canada, the USA, or Mexico.So there's definitely no duty on it. Taxes, well, that's another party altogether. Personally, I don't know much about taxation laws in Canada, but having said that, I've crossed the border enough times by road to know that the CBSA agents are pretty darned awesome, jovial bunch who don't mind some humour in their jobs as opposed to their counterparts across the bridge.Also you could try and use their duty/tax estimate calculator.Residents Returning to Canada	Should I take a 2nd B.Eng or an advanced diploma?

why has there been a scarcity of high quality fantasy films	briefly describe how you would test a mineral for each of these properties	0	Bala Senthil Kumar’s comment is really the answer you’re looking for:“Because of a lack of high traction properties. The superhero movies are also fantasies and we have enough of them I think.”LOTR and Hobbit both had an existing, large fan base and so the movie studio was willing to risk the big budgets that the movies required to really be done well. And it turns out, it was money well spent.Marvel (now Disney), Warner Brothers and Fox studios are also tapping into existing fan bases as they make their comic book movies. Again, they’re hoping that the money spent to make these movies will be worth the risk.Terry Brooks’ Shannara series is a popular fantasy series, but not with the same kind of following as LOTR. Too much of a risk to be turned into a major set of movies, so instead a TV series has been made and is being shown on MTV, “The Shannara Chronicles.”Thing is, LOTR and The Hobbit set an extremely high standard for these types of movies. It took a lot of money, and an excellent director, to get those movies made. No one is going to risk that much money on lesser known stories.	Computers use a variety of data storage methods depending on use case. These are usually tiered, meaning you have large, bulk storage like hard drives for permanent storage all the way up to RAM which is used for temporary storage of data while the program is running.Computer RAM (DRAM) is composed of billions of tiny cells which store individual bits. Each one of these cells is composed of a capacitor (which stores an electrical charge) and a transistor which has control over the capacitor (controls the flow of charge in and out). When the data is needed, the transistor opens and lets the charge stored within the capacitor flow out into a buffer, where it is then read by the computer.Flash storage is a tier below that. Unlike DRAM, it is non-volatile, meaning data is retained after power is cut. I am not in any way qualified to talk about how flash memory works in detail with any amount of certainty, but essentially they rely on quantum effects to “trap” charges within special transistors.And even under that, you have mechanical hard drives. Hard drives are composed of metal platters which are spun around at several thousand rpm. Each one of these platters is plated with trillions of tiny magnets, which are polarized by a read/write head to represent data bits. This is relatively slow as you now have moving parts : the head needs to wait for data to come to it. Because of their nature, these drives are also exceptionally prone to damage from drops and data loss due to magnetic field exposure.And even below that you have magnetic tape. Tape is seldom used in the consumer market, but is alive and well in enterprise sectors. It has exceptional data density (current lt08 tapes can store up to 30TB of compressed data, and we've already seen prototypes from the like of sony that can reach 185TB). They are also cheap (you can buy enterprise grade lt08 tapes for less than 200$). However, they are exceptionally slow, even when compared to hard drives, as tapes have to rewind and fast forward just like old school VHS tapes to access data.

what do think of when you hear the word elect	what do you think when you hear the word japan	0	Disappointment.From arriving at Port Said we were constantly pestered by people trying to sell cheap replicas of the pyramids and other cheap rubbish.After a long journey down to Cairo, getting off the coach we gave our packed lunch to a very hungry looking boy in the street who was delighted, that is until some older boys came along and beat the living daylights out of him for accepting it.Passing the locals in the early hours of the morning, some washing themselves in waste water collecting in the gutters you are reminded that despite a modern facade, you are in what is still essentially a third world country.I’ve always had a romantic view of the Pyramids of Giza, but it was spoiled slightly as we drove along “Giza Road” , briefly passing the “Giza Supermarket” and the “Giza Laundrette” until finally arriving at the Giza Pyramids themselves.More jostling by street vendors vying for business and then onto the choice of transport to make the final stretch to the top of the plateau- horse and carriage or camel.So we opted for camel, and sitting on a threadbare saddle and feeling slightly foolish about the whole thing we were treated to a brief bout of blackmail by the camel drivers who were banging the camels together with the tourists sitting on top until they gave up and paid a handsome tip just to be allowed to get off.Then, the first sight of the pyramids and the crushing realization that, far from the usual romantic desert scenes in the brochures you suddenly realise that the Egyptian Tourist Board have made a great job of making it look romantic and remote when the actual truth is that the scene resembles something more like a bunch of ruins which have been placed on top of a hill to hide the crappy view of decaying buildings, industrial units and shops which look more like this :-Then onto the Cairo Museum, and a lovely encounter with a very enthusiastic Tourist Police Officer who was quite happy to give directions to the museum…but wanted a tip first, standing there with a huge smile and his upturned thumb and forefinger rubbing together in the unmistakeable international gesture which means “Give me money”Then the museum itself- home to some of the greatest treasures and antiquities in the world- the sarcophagi- the statues- the Golden Mask of Tutankhamen… and the horrible dry rot creeping through the wooden cabinets and the plumbing leaks in the ceiling leaving dark stained watermarks dangerously close to the exhibits , which makes you realise that perhaps these priceless objects are not being cared for as well as they should be.Having said that, this was back in 1992 and I have heard that things have improved a little since!	Leg warmers. Soft wispy bangs. Grey and navy suits. Peeing over the platform. Hot bubbling nabe. Hands holding long lacquered chopsticks. Puffy squares of mochi thrown into hot chicken soup.When I think of Japan I think of massive firework displays in a hot August sky, sunk deeply in a crowd that cries “Sugoi, sugoi!” I see the blues and yellows of ladies yukatas, and black thonged wooden sandals that force your toes to stretch wider than usual.I think of packages of foods in department store basements, varieties of fish, eel that swim in a tank. I see elegant bottles of sake, and dried kombu in packages with little squares stuck inside saying, “preservatives, do no eat.”I see ginkgo leaves everywhere, big as my head. And enormous crows hopping around the parks. I see cemeteries at the top of mountain ridges, markers in stone and offerings such as Buddha statues with oranges wearing mittens, and coats.In my mind, I remember big chunky manga comic books in the hands of young people, brown dyed hair sprayed perfectly in place. I see naked women in the newspaper next to me and the bright light from pachinko parlors whizzing by outside the train in the dark.I remember the smell of tatami mats- that intoxicating scent of bamboo. Standing at a counter eating ramen noodles, the fake plastic food in the windows. I remember the fried pork cutlets with sesame gravy dribbled on them, next to a pile of thinly sliced cabbage. Futons with down comforters, low on the floor. Public baths and sitting on little stools to shower. Dumping hot water over my head with a bucket. Sitting in a hot bath with neighbors.The crowds, bicycle bells ringing behind me, white gloves of the taxi driver and the lace over the seat. I remember the sing songy ditty of the pedestrian walk sign honking out a Japanese tune. Getting my long skirts caught in the bicycle spokes and wheels. Riding with one arm, the other holding an umbrella.
which is the best programming language to learn in 2017	how should you start learning programming	0	JavaScriptNot to be confused with Java, JavaScript is primarily a client-side scripting language used for front-end development. JavaScript is compatible across all browsers and is used to create interactive web apps, often through libraries such as jQuery and front-end frameworks such as AngularJS, Ember.js, React, and more.JavaScript can also be used as a server-side language through the Node.js platform. Two years ago, Node.js was still quite young, but its community has grown a lot since then, and you can now find many resources here. You can also build hybrid mobile apps with JavaScript through using frameworks such as phonegap, while Facebook’s React Native allows you to build native mobile apps with JavaScript.However, JavaScript is also known as a difficult language because it is untyped and, thus, difficult to debug. There are statically typed versions, such as Microsoft's TypeScript or the JSX, that React uses.RubyRuby was developed so developers can have fun and be productive at the same time. Ruby was made popular by the Ruby on Rails framework, a full-stack web framework optimized for programming happiness. As Ruby reads like English and Rails has tools that make common development tasks easier “out-of-the-box”, many would recommend learning Ruby as your first programming language.Ruby is mostly used for back-end development, and popular sites such as Airbnb, Shopify, Bloomberg, Hulu, Slideshare, and more, were all built with Ruby on Rails.PythonPython is another highly recommended language for beginners, and is the most popular introductory language at Top U.S. Universities.Developers have used Python to build desktop apps and web apps alike, and it has great tools for data mining. In addition, Python is particularly popular in academic communities for scientific computing, data analysis, and bioinformatics.Google, Dropbox, Pinterest, Instagram, Reddit, BitTorrent, Civilization IV, and more, were built with Python.PHPPHP is a server-side scripting language and is usually considered beginner-friendly. It’s easy to conceptualize what the PHP code will do, which makes it easy to pick up. Most websites have been built with PHP because the language is heavily specialized for the web.Facebook, Wikipedia, Yahoo!, Tumblr, Wordpress, and more, were built with PHP.Statically Typed LanguagesApps built with statically typed languages are known to be more scalable, stable, and maintainable. Static languages are usually more strict in catching errors through type checking, and it takes more code to build a prototype. Game engines, mobile apps, and enterprise-level back-ends are usually built with statically typed languages.JavaAs a general-purpose language, Java is used to build Android apps, desktop apps, and games. Java is also commonly used as a server-side language for enterprise-level back-end development - 90 percent of Fortune 500 companies use Java.Furthermore, Hadoop is a popular Java-based framework used for storing and processing big data, and is implemented by enterprises such as Yahoo, Facebook, and Amazon Web Services.CC is often used to program system software and is the lingua franca of Operating Systems.C has influenced almost every programming language we’ll be examining in this article, especially Objective-C and C++. So, if you know C well, it'd probably be easier for you to pick up other popular languages. Since C takes more complex code to perform simple tasks, beginners may find it tough to stay motivated if this is their first language. However, knowledge of C will definitely help you as a programmer in the long run.Objective-C / Swift (for iOS development)Objective-C is a layer built on top of the C language, which makes it static. With that said, it can also be used for dynamic typing. Apple’s Swift is a static language designed to be compatible with Objective-C, but its static-typing makes it more ...	This question has been answered literally 10s of thousands of times on Quora, but I’ll give my opinion since this was an A2A.No matter the route you take, it doesn’t really matter as long as you practice a shit ton. Look through the popular languages and decide which one you want to start with. I’d go with one of the following: Java, Swift, Python, C, C++, smalltalk, PHP. It doesn’t matter that much, and before you get a job doing it you’ll probably want to have bounced around a little bit.Instead of giving step by step instructions, I’m going to give you a few pointers. Please pay attention to these, don’t just be like “yeah whatever.” Following these tips will make you grow way faster, and if you actually follow these tips completely, you’ll probably be the fastest learning programmer in history. Nobody follows these rules until way later than they should have, and everyone regrets it a bit. It’s not a huge deal because everyone does it, but you can seriously make a huge difference. You could be job-ready in 3 months easy if you practice every day and do this stuff. If you don’t, I’d say you’re probably looking at about 1–3 years of practice at least before anyone hires you.So without further ado, and in somewhat of a loose order of most to least important, my guide to learning how to program:Practice way more than you study/read. Don’t just read how to do things, try them. You’ll find that most of the time, there’s complexities that aren’t mentioned in the text, and you’ll learn way more. Just because you think you know how to make a class in C++ doesn’t mean you even know how to get the code to compile. This is by far the most important point.Don’t learn a programming language, learn to program. Sure, you’ll use a programming language and get proficient with it, but it’s just a tool. If you pick up a book from start to finish on a language, you’ll have learned so much stuff you are never going to use. If you insist on using a textbook, use one that emphasizes examples, or teaches you a programming practice like web development or machine learning. Most programming language focused textbooks aren’t good as anything but a reference. Furthermore, it’s really important not to be tied to any one language, especially as a beginner. There’s a ton of great material out there that is taught in a certain language, but is universally important. You should be able to learn from examples that are written in a language you’ve never used.Try random stuff. Try new frameworks, packages, languages, ideas, etc. just to see how they work. Never made an app? Try it. Never used a front end JS framework? Try it. Buy an arduino. Get a book on object oriented design. Try using a NoSQL database for your next project, or try using a hosted database on AWS.Don’t take days off. Taking time off takes you ‘out of the zone.’ You want these problems in the back of your mind at all times. Taking days off forces you to get back in the zone, and remember things. I come up with solutions to problems or cool ideas all the time, whether I’m driving home from work or at the gym.Make programming a hobby. Learn to enjoy it. This comes with straying away from reading textbooks, and practicing more. Make cool shit. Get experience. Don’t say “I heard that’s a bad idea.” Say “that’s a bad idea, this is what happened to me when I tried that.” Nobody gives a shit about what you read in a textbook, I promise. Well at least not nearly as much as they care about what you experienced firsthand.Finish projects 100%. Don’t say ‘eh it’s pretty much done.’ and move on. Finish it. Publish it. Tell your parents and friends to use it. You’ll never know how much work was actually left. The very end of a project can introduce massive holes in your code. Even moreso, once you’ve launched it, your users will find plenty more. Get it published and get people using it.Network. Quora has introduced me to a lot of cool programmers that have tons of knowledge to give me. I’ve also worked with some kickass engineers/developers that gave me a ton of priceless knowledge. Work in a team as much as possible, it will teach you how companies do things at scale. Version control, task management, code documentation, code readability, loose coupling of objects, etc. are all way more important when working on projects with others.Read tech blogs and info sites. Quora is a great one. Techcrunch, Techmeme, Medium, Stackoverflow, Linkedin, and facebook are the ones I use the most. My newsfeeds on all of those are filled with the newest info on the tech industry.If people read this I’ll edit it as I think of more.

cochin to london etihad is the change over time of 1hr sufficient in dubai	what is difference between china and  america  to send gifts	0	"London house prices are crazy:And disconnected from what people earn:Fortunately they have now started to pause:However I hope you are not a renter because rents are going up:Supply and demand is key - population and households are growing faster than the housing stock:They are being pulled in by jobs:But the main thing is that we are not building enough houses:My two cents are that house prices will stabilise around here until 2020 while rents go up by >50% (that's 15%^3 if you're wondering).Buy to let is about 13% of mortgages in any given year and c5% of the housing stock. The government has proposed a tapering of the interest deduction for buy to let borrowing and a 3% stamp duty surcharge on second properties.It seems likely that these changes will make buy to let unprofitable, and force significant rent rises. If that fails to generate the required returns, then landlords will sell up. This ""supply"" may keep prices in check. You can read a bit more about this here:The last few days I've been boring people with buy to let tax proposals.…In answer to some of the risks to house prices I would respond as follows.Economic recession - we already had a terrible one in 2007/08, check the chart at the top it barely left a dent.Higher interest rates - this is plausible, and there are levels which would drag back the market. However there is not the inflation or economic animal spirits to justify high interest rates. We are well aware of the deflation in global tradeable goods. And the rest of it is linked to wages...where rises would be bullish.Less foreign buyers - this has begun and is partly what is being targeted by the government. But let go of thinking foreign buyers are driving the market, they are concentrated at the high end and have a small impact relative to the lack of supply.London losing its cachet - I think this has already started. I put my money on Berlin next, which is both culturally exciting and cheap. But this is slow cooker of a change, and not a factor over the next few years.One last tip, buy outside London if you can.

If you're a reader, votes are the primary way you can indicate which answers are good and which ones need improvement. The ranking within a page is designed to evolve based on votes that appear over time.
what will be the resolution one should have for the year 2016	what  your resolution for year 2016	1	If you’re considering learning a new language (or refreshing an old one) as I am for my New Year's resolution this year, you should check out Duolingo, the free app/site used by over 110 million people and winner of Apple, Google and TechCrunch awards. You can choose from over 15 languages including Spanish, French, Portuguese, Italian, German, Turkish, and Russian. It’s available on the web (www.duolingo.com), Android, iOS, and Windows Phone.DISCLAIMER: I had such a good experience with Duolingo that I recently applied to work there (and somehow convinced them to take me!).Here’s why I think Duolingo helped me stick with my New Year’s resolution:Its bite-sized lessons prevent burnout. You can use the app anywhere and anytime,and I’ve snuck in many sessions while waiting in lines or during down time (though I also stumbled upon two effective learning times: during my morning commute to work and right before I go to bed).It is designed to feel like a game to keep you motivated. As you get better, you level up to unlock new classes, compete with friends and buy entertaining skill lessons (like ‘flirting’) with virtual currency.It might also help to know that Duolingo is 100% free, and totally legit: it was previously chosen by Apple as iPhone App of the Year and by Google as Best of the Best for Android, and it happens to be the world’s most popular learning app with over 110 million users!Why did I start using Duolingo in the first place? My decision to even use Duolingo in the first place comes from a broader realization I had a few years ago. As someone who used to chronically set lofty goals and chronically abandon them (as my dusty, barely-touched saxophone can testify to), it finally clicked that I was setting goals that were overly-ambitious and difficult to measure. Rewriting my goal of ‘getting fit’ to ‘be able to do 100 pushups in one day by the end of the year’ was the difference between failing and succeeding for me.Note: if you have Mark Zuckerberg-esque abilities to conquer outrageously ambitious resolutions, ignore everything I’ve just said!As a result, this year, I rewrote my previously unsuccessful resolution of 'learning a new language' to 'complete the Duolingo Spanish course in one year with ten minutes of practice everyday.' It worked.And for 2016?Now that this year went reasonably well, I feel pretty comfortable setting two language-related New Year's resolutions for 2016: i) read 4 Spanish novels (>200 pages) and watch 3 Spanish TV shows (any genre), and ii) finish the Esperanto course on Duolingo with 10 minutes of practice everyday.Oh, and my non-language learning New Year’s resolution is to start being on time for everything.

Trees provide shade and complement landscaping nicely, but they can also cause major disputes when they fall over. A tree may fall over if it is not properly maintained and diseased, or it may fall over during a storm. When a tree falls over onto a neighbor's property, a homeowner is often left to wonder if he or she is liable. Most people assume that they are liable since it is their tree. However, this is not always true.When a tree falls over onto a neighbor's property, that neighbor should submit a claim to his or her insurance company immediately. The insurance company is usually responsible for taking care of the damages. This is true if the tree fell over due to an act of nature. For example, a healthy tree that falls over during a tornado, hurricane, wind storm or winter storm would not be the responsibility of the homeowner. Since the homeowner living on the property where the fallen tree was rooted did not intentionally push the tree over, nature is responsible. This means that the neighbor's insurance policy should cover it under perils.However, there are some cases where a homeowner could be held liable. If the tree fell on the neighbor's home when the homeowner was trying to cut down the tree without professional help, the damage would be the homeowner's responsibility. Also, if the tree was dying, unstable or diseased and the homeowner knew about it, he or she could be liable if it falls over on its own. He or she could also be liable if it falls over during a very light storm that would not normally knock over a tree. When homeowners know they have dying, diseased or unstable trees, it is their responsibility to take steps to prevent them from causing severe damage.In the event a homeowner is liable for the damages, his or her personal insurance company will have to pay the damages. The insurer will have to also investigate the claim and defend the homeowner if he or she is sued by the neighbor whose property the tree fell on. If the homeowner being sued loses, his or her insurer will pay up to the policy limit for damages. For any further damages beyond that, the homeowner is financially responsible. Neighbors can also submit liability claims against homeowner policies.Most cases involve trees falling over due to storms or acts of nature, so many homeowners whose trees fall over do not have to worry about their insurers footing the bill. Also, they do not have to worry about premium increases if they are not found liable for the damages. In some cases, neighbors may still try to sue to recover their deductibles. The best way to avoid this scenario is to prevent it in the first place. Homeowners should check their trees regularly and have them inspected at the first sign of disease or any health issues.A professional arborist can analyze the tree to see if it needs any special treatments, pruning or complete removal. This may seem like an unnecessary expense, but it is much less expensive than the potential cost of paying for a neighbor's home being destroyed and the legal costs that ensue. For those who plan to stay in their homes for any length of time, it is best to try to keep peace with neighbors, so this is also a good way to prevent quarrels or ongoing problems. To learn more about damage claims from fallen trees, discuss concerns with an agent.Source: Who is Liable When a Tree Falls on a Neighbor\'s PropertyRelated Post: save money buying a home in saint paul
does any one have ebook of answers of wren and martin grammer and composition	why did barvaria join germany	0	Buy a copy:Middle School English Grammar and Composition (MSEGC): Wren, Martin: 9789352534722: Amazon.com: BooksOh, you mean you want to cheat, and you want to get it for free?Geez, your generation really is entitled.	A brief history from the perspective of “Bonhoeffer”Germany’s involvement in The Great War, and the loss of that war, resulted in harsh war penalties known as The Treaty of Versailles. This same treaty took away German colonies, massively reduced Germany’s standing army to 100,000 men, and charged Germany with starting the war, requiring massive war repayments.These war repayments were finally payed off in 2010- 92 years after Germany’s defeat! (Germany to Settle WWI Debt After 92 Years). This bankrupted the country in the early 1920s, leading to an economic depression and mistrust between the German people and the German government, allowing the rise to power of Adolf Hitler and the Nazi Party.Hitler, in stark contrast from what we see of him today, was seen as a “savior” of Germany, someone who could make the nation proud once again, and as someone who would punish those responsible for the mistreatment of Germany after World War I- namely, the German government, the Jews, and the Communists.Hitler was, essentially, a madman- but he knew how to gain influence and maintain power. He would lie to the German people, make promises he had no intention of keeping, and ultimately plunge Germany into a second World War, starting with the invasion of Poland on September 1st, 1939.It is important to note that Germany briefly tried a new form of government, called the Weimar Republic from 1919 until 1933, but this ultimately did not last. The German people wanted a strong leader, as the Kaiser had led during World War 1. Adolf Hitler proved to be a strong leader who made promises to restore Germany’s economic prosperity and position of power in the world, while also “righting the wrongs” caused during WW1.These lists of grievances, combined with the political genius, rise to power and ruthless tyranny of Adolf Hitler, ultimately resulted in Germany’s part in starting the deadliest conflict in human history- World War 2.
what is mathxmath if mathxleftdfrac1xright 0math	what is mathmathop limlimitsx to 0frac1xfracxx1math	0	Let’s do it step by step. First thing first, move 1𝑥1x\frac{1}{x} to the right side of the equal sign, like this𝑥=−1𝑥x=−1xx = -\frac{1}{x}If you see this pattern, you want to move 𝑥xx variable from the right side to the other side, like this𝑥×𝑥=−1x×x=−1x \times x = -1Now, we know that 𝑥×𝑥x×xx \times x is equal to 𝑥2x2x^2, so𝑥2=−1x2=−1x^2 = -1Next step, we will square root both side, like this𝑥2‾‾‾√=−1‾‾‾√x2=−1\sqrt{x^2} = \sqrt{-1}We know that 𝑥2‾‾‾√x2\sqrt{x^2} is equal to 𝑥xx, but what about −1‾‾‾√−1\sqrt{-1}? The mathematician develop another term to define these number. It was called imaginer number (symbol: 𝑖ii or 𝑗jj). The final solution is𝑥=±𝑖x=±ix = \pm iBut, hey! Why there’s plus minus sign on there? Because we know that if you squared 𝑖ii or −𝑖−i-i, the result is same.Update:Don’t belive me? Let’s check.If 𝑥=𝑖x=ix = i, then𝑖+1𝑖i+1ii + \frac{1}{i}−1‾‾‾√+1−1√−1+1−1\sqrt{-1} + \frac{1}{\sqrt{-1}}−1√×−1√−1√+1−1√−1×−1−1+1−1\frac{\sqrt{-1} \times \sqrt{-1}}{\sqrt{-1}} + \frac{1}{\sqrt{-1}}−1√2+1−1√−12+1−1\frac{\sqrt{-1}^2 + 1}{\sqrt{-1}}−1+1−1√−1+1−1\frac{-1 + 1}{\sqrt{-1}}0−1√0−1\frac{0}{\sqrt{-1}}Zero divided by any number (including imaginery number) except zero is 000.	Interestingly, there’s another very creative way to find the limit without L’Hospital, or any expansion of 𝑒.e. \hspace{5em} {\boxed{\displaystyle{ f(x) = \sum \limits_{n=0}^{\infty} \frac{x^n}{n!} f^n(0) = f(0) + x f'(0) + \frac{x^2}{2!}f''(0) + \dots }}}\blacksquareTo get started, first understand our purpose.Let  \displaystyle { f(x) = {e^x - 1 -x } }We’ve to find:  \hspace{5em} \displaystyle {\lim \limits_{x \rightarrow 0} \frac{f(x)}{x^2}}One way is to create a replica of the function and use it instead of the given function. But, this requires the knowledge of derivatives.First, understand how it works,Suppose, A and B are 2 cars. They are traveling. Let  p(t) be a function of Car A which returns the Position of the x-axis of the car at the time t. Similarly, for car B, let’s say it  q(t) . Now, we want both cars to have the same position every time, or Mathematically,  p(t) = q(t).In Mathematical Terms, we want to create a replica of p(t) as q(t). So, for that.Let  q(x) = a + bx + cx^2 + dx^3 \dotsAt time = 0 sec, both cars should have the same position?Or  \displaystyle {\hspace{5em} p(0) = q(0) = a}The velocity of each car should be the same.We’ve position functions. The derivative of position is velocity. So, velocity should be equal.Or  \displaystyle{ \hspace{5em} p'(t) = q'(t) = b + 2cx + 3dx^2 \dots}Now, we’ve got an expression for velocity, As we know, the velocity at t=0 should be same.Or \displaystyle{ \hspace{5em} p'(0) = q'(0) = b}Now, they should have equal rate of change of velocity (derivative) or aka acceleration. At time. t=0Or  \displaystyle{ \hspace{5em} p''(0) =  q''(0) = 2c}Now, they have the same acceleration at the start, if the rate of change of acceleration becomes equal for both cars, then they ’d have the same position throughout.Like this, if we keep finding the Rate of change of rate of change again and again, then we’d definitely get function  q(t) as an exact duplicate.Now, keeping this in mind, If the rate of change of 2 functions are equal, and again the rate of change of rate of change becomes equal and similarly this keeps going … Then, we get an exact duplicate of functions in form of algebra in infinite series.This is how infinite series is done.For example: \displaystyle{\hspace{5em} f(x) = x - \frac{x^3}{3!} + \frac{x^5}{5!}\dots}Here \sin x and f(x) have the same starting point, 0, the same rate of change, and the rate of change of rate of change are equal and rate of change of rate of change of rate of change is same … infinity So, no matter which version of sine function you use you’d always get the same result because the graph of both functions is exactly the same!Now, we’ll do the exact same thing for f(x) and will create a duplicate for that function and use that to find the limit of the given expression in seconds!Let us call  g(x) = a + bx + cx^2 + dx^3 + ex^4 + \dots \infty \space terms f(x) = e^x -1 - xNow,\displaystyle { \hspace{5em} e^x - 1 - x = a + bx + cx^2 + dx^3 + ex^4 \\ putting \space x=0 \space a =0 \\ \frac{d}{dx} e^x - 1 - x = b + 2cx + 3dx^2 + 4ex^3 \\ e^x - 1 = b + 2cx + 3dx^2 + 4ex^3 \dots \\ putting  \space x=0 \\ 0 = b \\\frac{d}{dx} (e^x - 1)= e^x = 2c + 3.2dx + 4.3ex^2 \dots \\ putting \space x = 0 \\ 1 = 2c \\ c = \frac 1 2 \\ \frac{d}{dx}e^x = 3.2d + 4.3.2. e^x \dots \\ putting \space x = 0 \\ 1 = 3.2d \\ d = \frac{1}{3!} \\ \frac{d}{dx}e^x = 4.3.2.e \dots \\ putting \space x=0 \\ e = \frac{1}{4!}}Thus, putting the values of coefficients, we get an expression! e^x - 1 - x = 0 + 0.x + \frac{1}{2}x^2 + \frac{1}{3!}x^3 + \frac{1}{4!}x^4 \dotsLet’s see Timelapse see How our graph was made :)Our graph  f(x) = e^x -x -1Red - f(x), black one:- which we created!This is our f(x) function.Expansion Upto 1 term:Upto 2 terms:Upto 3 terms:Upto 4 termsUpto 5 terms...
whenever its about  nonascii her nonascii  its a very special feeling tried hard to forget her but she  alwys spcl should i stop talking to her even as a friend 	how should i stop thinking about someone	0	I recently told my best friend that I have feelings for her. I knew she did not feel the same way about me, but I just did not want to hide my feelings from her. She has stopped talking to me. I have tried a lot but she refuses to reply to me. I just need my best friend back. What should I do?	Our mind is thought generation machine, and it is fast generating thoughts. So it is rather impossible to stop thinking. Your problem seems to be that you have many worries, which do not allow you to concentrate on a single point.you have to resolve your issues. Few may be simple, others may be complex. Few may be urgent, others may be important, and few may br routine, demanding your attention, and you mind is busy going from one point to other and wandering here and there. This is a normal phenomenon, till you learn to streamline these thoughts and resolve the issues, one by one.You are correct, that such rush of various thoughts, one after the other so fast, that you believe these are simultaneous, and you want to stop all that.It is not a helpless situation, but you need a help. Right now, i put few suggestions, that will work as first aid.You need some breathing exercise. During normal breathing keep your full attention on breathing. Observe which nostril is breathing in and out. Do not control , just observe. Continue it for few minutes. The thought pattern will slow down.Put up all your issues classified in heads on a note book. Urgent important routine, and resolve one at a time, as if you are a consultant. Nature has given you sufficient discretion to take reasonable decisions for your issues, and God is with you. Decisions may be of permanent or transitory nature, do act on these and move on. Slowly your mind will be in comfortable zone,Find a role model, and take his/her help for rationalizing your thought pattern.
what are mutual funds how do they work	what is mutual fund all about	1	Mutual funds? In Detail!! That should be like an answer for 25 marks question.So, assuming that you want to invest in mutual funds and want to know about them before you start investing in them, I would be answering it from an investors point of view and will not go in details about how to set them, wats an AMC, etc. stuffs.Mutual fund, as the name suggests, is a fund, which is owned mutually by all those who put in it. There are 2 main reasons of why mutual funds are formed:1. For a ordinary person, who knows not much about markets, about investing, its very difficult to manage money. He wouldnt know how to track a stock, or how to value it? So, for these people, a simple way is just to give there money to someone else who can manage it properly and help you in growing it. But, you can not give all your life’s saving just to anyone. What if the person you gave money ran away with it?? Thats why mutual funds are set up, so that you can put your money into funds and they will manage it. Since, Fund is managed by AMC, and AMCs are monitored by trusts, your money is safe. Plus these fund managers are intelligent, a keep track of markets and stuffs, they are very much qualified to manage money.2. Another reason is to take advantage of scale and diversity. Suppose you only have Rs. 2,000 with you, and you want to invest it into a stock, which costs around Rs 4,000? You just cannot buy a half stock, and you dont have enough money to buy a single share. Or you want to diversify your portfolio to reduce market risk, but you cannot buy 10 different stock with your small amount. So what will you do? You put your money into a Fund, similar to you, other people also give their money to the the fund, and now fund will have enough money and it can buy any stock it wants. It can also diversify it across multiple stocks to reduce its risk.So thats the main purpose of why funds are formed. Next comes is how are they operated?So, while setting up a fund, the fund manager decides that it wants a total of, for example, Rs 1 crore (total corpus also known as AUM). So, what the AMC will do is, divide Rs. 1 crore in to small parts of Rs. 50 each, so 2lakhs parts in total. Now this Rs. 50 will be the initial NAV of the Fund, at which you or any other person can just buy the units from the AMC. So, if you have Rs. 2000, you will get 40 units. The AMC will then you all the money collected and invest it. As it invests by buying stock, bonds, etc the value of total Rs 1 crore will change, depend upon the current value of all the shares, bonds purchased. So suppose, the current value totals to Rs1.2 crore. Since there were 2lakhs ubits, the NAV will now be Rs1.2 crore divided by 2 lakh units, i.e. Rs. 60. that means the Rs.2000 you invested at Rs. 50 has now become Rs 60 and your total investment is Rs2400. Similar would be the effect if the value of total corpus fall.So, this is what a mutual fund is.If you want to know any specific or anything more, then message me or reply to this.	Mutual funds?

how has the vertebral column anatomy changed through time	when calculating bullet spin mv x 12 twist rate in inches x 60rpm does distance to target matter	0	There are two sides to this question:Do you mean the actual columns within a text frame ?Or the column guides, which appear in the page view ?Part 1The actual columns (and gutter) within a text frame can be set directly in the top Control bar, when you have selected a text frame with the Move tool. You can also use the command Object – Text Frame Options to set these numbers as well. This is the oldest and simplest feature in InDesign.However, in this top section of the dialogue you can also let the number of columns be related to the size of the text frame by stating a column’s minimum width, so it can change dynamically when the frame is being stretched manually or automatically by Alternative Layout adjustments. This is a less older option. Read all about it.Another way to set columns is to Spread or Split Columns based on the Paragraph setting. This is the most recent feature (CS5). Check it out…Part 2The initial Column Guides setting can be found in the New Document dialogue (creating the guides on the Master Page), and afterwards on any page or the Master Page in the Layout – Margins & Columns command.The columns guides can also be unevenly distributed by unlocking them through the View – Grids & Guides command and simply grabbing them with the Move tool.	That depends on whether you are referring to rotation per unit distance or unit time. I suspect you intended per unit time, in which case the answer is yes. The rifling imparts a given amount of spin per unit distance; but the greater the billet speed, then the faster that distance is traversed. Let’s take a hypothetical 1 turn in 7 inches. If bullet A is accelerated to 24,000 inches per second (2000fps), it is is completing one rotation every 0.000291666666667 seconds. If bullet B, being pushed by a larger powder charge, is accelerated to 36,000 inches per second (3000fps), it is completing one rotation every 0.000194444444444 seconds. In both cases, they are rotating approximately one turn in seven inches. Note that the slower bullet is taking longer to complete each rotation, and the faster billet is taking a shorter time to complete each rotation. Please also note that these units are all at the muzzle; however, all other factors (bullet weight, for example) being the same, the rotational rate should still favor the faster bullet, all the way to impact, provided that the rifling twist is sufficient to keep both bullets stable through their respective flights. Inadequate spin will introduce too many factors to predict the comparable spin rates at impact.
which acoustic bass guitar is the best	how do you go about maintaining an acoustic bass guitar	0	"I've owned several acoustic bass guitars.  I keep one for convenience when I need to grab a bass and sit on the patio or figure out a song in a hurry.  The first, and best, was a Martin BM.  It was a plain Jane with a satin finish and a transducer. No tone, volume or EQ controls.  Just a 1/4"" jack in the end pin.  It had a wonderful tone and good volume without electric amplification.  I eventually sold it to ""upgrade"" to a Martin 16GTAE bass.  This bass had a better finish and better electronics but lacked the warm tone and volume of the BM when I played it unplugged.  I was never completely happy with it.I sold the 16GTAE and now I have a National resonator bass with a highlander pickup.  It's the loudest acoustic bass I have owned but it does have a slightly metallic tone like a resonator guitar.  It's not bad but it can be a little harsh sounding in a jam session, depending on the type of music being played.The Taylor AB basses (discontinued) are highly valued by collectors but they don't have much volume unplugged.  I almost bought one a couple of times when you could still find them in stores.  That's how I first found the Martin BM, shopping for a Taylor AB.  I couldn't talk myself into spending $2k on the Taylor so I picked up the Martin BM just to hear it and I was amazed at the sound.  It only cost $800, so it was a bargain.  I should have held onto her when I still had the chance.Long story, short ending.  If you can find a Martin BM (discontinued) for sale somewhere give her a try.  I think you'll be happy with it.  I know I was.  Good luck!"	1. the most important thing is to loosen up  the strings ,if u r not playing the guitar for more than a week . cause it might increase the guitar action and you dont want that to happen . 2. keep it in a bag . don't put it in inappropriate positions.getting a guitar stand is best .(floor stand(better) or wall mounted stand)3. while travelling use a hard case to carry the guitar . 4. Give it for servicing in good shops once in a year.And thats pretty much it . clean the guitar time to time . Change the strings whenever needed . Care for it like a baby ;)  and ur guitar will make a long run
my maths have become extremely weak and i am in class 12th how can i improve my maths so that i can clear my jee exams next year	i want to do a bba i only got 62 percent  in class 12 non maths i am taking 1 year drop for the entrance exam of symboperating systemis ggsipu etc should i also give an improvement next year	0	I don’t understand what u mean by your maths have become extremely weak. Were they strong earlier? What is the basis on which u are saying this?Please note that performance is std X board exams in Maths should not be considered as a reflection of your strength in that subject. The same also applies to Science.Board exams are more a test of memory than understanding, so scoring there is not necessarily an indication of your understanding of the subject.My personal view is that board exams are only there due to the selfish interests of uneducated state education ministers who fear that they will become jobless or reduce in importance if these no longer exist. That’s why they have retained these.Thankfully, from this year, IITs and NITs have decided not to accept the board marks in calculating the rankings of JEE Main. So only the people who have a good understanding of Science and Maths, which are the pillars of engineering, will be able to join good engg. colleges. Board marks are going to be used only as eligibility criteria, though.If you are not sure of your strength in Maths, then you should review your choice of engineering as a career in the first place. No point in becoming an engineer at any cost thru a sub-standard engg. college and joining the 80% jobless engineers who are already there.	First of all congratulate yourself that you have got first devision which 30% student fail to get in 12th exam.If no future plan after graduation :It depends on you if you are comfortable with a job after doing your bba then go for your preparation but I don't think so it will take one year to prepare for an entrance like bba so, don't waste it.
what is a function in the context of functional programming	what is functional programming	0	At first approximation, a function in a functional language is like a mathematical function: for every value in its domain it produces a unique value in its codomain. But if you dig deeper, you'll find out that things are not that simple. First of all, a programming language can only implement computable functions. You have to provide an algorithm to calculate the value. This algorithm has to be written using language constructs, so the question is, what subset of mathematical functions can be implemented using those constructs?You quickly find out that without some kind of looping or recursion, your powers are quite limited. The simplest kind of recursion is one in which, with every step of the algorithm, you decrement some counter, until it reaches zero. This way you can, for instance, calculate the factorial of any number. The important part is that you have a counter that is decremented, so you are guaranteed to reach zero and finish the calculation in finite time. This is called primitive recursion. Unfortunately, it can be proven that primitive recursion is not powerful enough to implement every computable function. Then there is general recursion, which doesn't have a natural counter. This one is powerful enough but it has a different problem: some of the functions you can define will never terminate. And there is no in-between that would let you implement all computable functions but eliminate non-termination. So functions in a (Turing-complete) functional language correspond to computable functions in mathematics, plus non-terminating procedures.	I have seen many wrong answers in the Internet, so I guess that both the concept of functional programming and some of the misconceptions require clarification.The first thing is that the word “function” in “functional programming” is meant to refer to functions in mathematical sense (i.e. mappings or associations between input and output). This is extremely easy to get confused with the notion of procedures, because many programming languages and programming language tools conflate these two notions.A procedure (sometimes also called a subroutine) is an encapsulated, possibly parameterized sequence of steps of instructions for achieving a desired goal. For example, here are two procedures for preparing an instant soup:This kind of procedural thinking is common in Computer Science for teaching algorithms.Now in some languages procedures can also return a value. For example, in C there is a procedure clock(), which “returns the number of clock ticks elapsed since the start of the program”, and a procedure called rand() which returns a different pseudo-random number each time it is called.While the manual calls these procedures “functions”, these are not the functions in the sense that is meant in functional programming, i.e. they are not mathematical functions.Having procedures that return values, it is possible to use them to implement functions. For example, the procedure square defined in the following wayint square(int x) { return x * x; }implements a function in mathematical sense: every time this procedure is called with the same argument, it will return the same value. (In languages like C that conflate functions with procedures, such procedures are called “pure functions”).Another common misconception about functional programming is that it is about programming with “lambdas” or “closures”.“Lambda” is a rather obscure name for a concept of anonymous function or (more often) anonymous procedure. “Closure” is a common name for a function enclosed with some context. Here’s a common example in JavaScriptfunction make_counter() {  var counter = 0;  return function() {    return ++counter;  };}This is not an example of functional programming (note that — like C — JavaScript conflates the notions of functions and procedures, and uses the keyword function to refer to a procedure).It generates a procedure which, when executed, gives the number of times it has been executed to that point. It is not a mapping between input and output. It is easy to immediately see that this code is not functional, because it contains the ++ operator, which modifies the value of the counter variable, or — as programmers like to say — performs a mutation.Which brings us to yet another confusion that is quite common in programming languages, namely — conflating the notions of definition, binding and assignment. These three are often expressed using the same operator — usually the equality sign. For example, if you see the following Python code:variable = valueyou’re unable to say whether it is a definition or an assignment. This distinction is crucial in functional programming. A definition introduces new binding (between a name and a value) to current scope. An assignment modifies the value of a variable. There are no assignments in functional programs. A binding creates new scope where a name is associated with a bound value. Python’s capabilities for creating bindings are actually very limited.The distinction is very plain to see in Scheme. The definition is expressed using the define form, as in(define variable value)The assignment is performed using the set! form:(set! variable new-value)Lastly, bindings are created using forms such as lambda and let, for example(let ((variable some-value))  ;; the binding of `variable` shadows some existing binding here  ;; (if any)  ...);; here `variable` still has its old value (if it had one b...
what is the main difference between socialism and communism	what is the difference between socialism marxism and communism	1	Most of the answers on this thread are fairly incomplete, inaccurate or outright boring.Let me explain them in a lucid and fun way.Imagine you’re a boss of a cotton firm. You produce 1 quintal of cotton every month. You have workers under you. The production cost is necessarily less than selling cost. The boss takes apart aside called profit and distribute the rest to the worker as wages. This is called capitalism.Imagine, if there was no boss and workers get the value of cotton they produce with no scope of profit is socialism.Socialism emerged as a protest against capitalism.[1]Capitalism is based on profit.Socialism is based on need.Capitalism is survival of the fittest.Socialism is focused on the welfare of least advantaged groups.In capitalism, capitalists are exploiters.In socialism, workers are exploiters.In capitalism, the state is controlled by the capitalist.In socialism, the state is controlled by workers.Some additional knowledge about socialism:The word socialism is used quite often in media and political speeches. It was also added to Indian constitution’s preamble through 42nd amendment. India is also a country which claims to be based on socialist principles but hardly seen post-1991 economic reforms of LPG.[2]Hence, endless varieties seem to emerge. Socialism was called a “hat[3]that lost its shape” by C.E.M. Joad.[4]Socialism stands for:Social and economic equality.Man is social by nature.Society is natural and prior to man.Then Karl Marx came into the picture in the 19th century, he influenced the socialism so much so that socialism began to be called before and after Marx.Marx reiterated that the French revolutionaries like Louis Blanc lack the understanding of capitalism.Hence after Marx, Revisionists, Fabianism, guild socialism and syndicalism followed. All these schools of thought are a subject matter of another answer.Marx is among the few philosophers by whose name a school of thought is established.Karl MarxHe was a materialist.[5] He was also a critique of religion and called it an opium of the masses.[6]Marx was neither the first or the last socialist. He is the most important personality in the evolution of socialism. He called the socialism propounded by others as utopian and called himself scientific.His works can be divided into two broad categories as young and mature Marx where young Marx talks about economic and philosophical manuscripts and the concept of alienation and mature Marx wrote a communist manifesto and Das Kapital.[7]He famously quoted:“In order to make history one has to live; in order to live one has to eat; in order to eat one has to produce. Hence it is for the production that man has formed society”( and not the other way round)Economic structure is a “base” of all other structures. Only when the economic structure changes, the superstructure can be changed.Socialism was one of the stages of a transition from capitalism to communism.According to Marx, socialism will come through violent revolution and overthrow of capitalism. This was the transitional stage and communism will follow.In communism, the private property is abolished. Classes will be abolished and class struggle will end.When struggle ends following that dialectics end and following that history ends.Hence, it is said that the communism is the end of history.End of history meant the end of contradiction.In communism, the state shall wither away as the state was an instrument of the propertied class.Communism is a society where people get thing according to their needs.But you may now wonder that Marx might be opposite to industrialisation given he called it an instrument of the bourgeois. Marx supported industrialization and supported mass production by machines to fulfil the need of every person.Marx called communism a state of perfect freedom. Freedom from necessities. Man is free and he does what he wanted to do.Freedom in capitalist society is not free but it is false consciousness which leads to alienation and isolation.Conclusion:Socialism stood as an opposition to Capitalism.Karl Marx influenced socialism like no other and explained the economic structure and dictatorship of bourgeoisie through it. He wanted a revolution. He wanted a violent overthrow of capitalists. Marxism is a school based on Marx's idea which regarded socialism as a transition stage to communism.For Marx, communism is a state of freedom and away from false consciousness.[8]Charles Tips also answered this question beautifully: Charles Tips's answer to What's the difference between Socialism, Marxism and Communism?AFootnotes[1] Karl Marx (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy)[2] 1991: Economic Reforms[3] Socialism is like a hat that has lost its shape because  everybody wears i[4] C.E.M.

This is called capitalism.Imagine, if there was no boss and workers get the value of cotton they produce with no scope of profit is socialism.Socialism emerged as a protest against capitalism.[1]Capitalism is based on profit.Socialism is based on need.Capitalism is survival of the fittest.Socialism is focused on the welfare of least advantaged groups.In capitalism, capitalists are exploiters.In socialism, workers are exploiters.In capitalism, the state is controlled by the capitalist.In socialism, the state is controlled by workers.Some additional knowledge about socialism:The word socialism is used quite often in media and political speeches. It was also added to Indian constitution’s preamble through 42nd amendment. India is also a country which claims to be based on socialist principles but hardly seen post-1991 economic reforms of LPG.[2]Hence, endless varieties seem to emerge. Socialism was called a “hat[3]that lost its shape” by C.E.M. Joad.[4]Socialism stands for:Social and economic equality.Man is social by nature.Society is natural and prior to man.Then Karl Marx came into the picture in the 19th century, he influenced the socialism so much so that socialism began to be called before and after Marx.Marx reiterated that the French revolutionaries like Louis Blanc lack the understanding of capitalism.Hence after Marx, Revisionists, Fabianism, guild socialism and syndicalism followed. All these schools of thought are a subject matter of another answer.Marx is among the few philosophers by whose name a school of thought is established.Karl MarxHe was a materialist.[5] He was also a critique of religion and called it an opium of the masses.[6]Marx was neither the first or the last socialist. He is the most important personality in the evolution of socialism. He called the socialism propounded by others as utopian and called himself scientific.His works can be divided into two broad categories as young and mature Marx where young Marx talks about economic and philosophical manuscripts and the concept of alienation and mature Marx wrote a communist manifesto and Das Kapital.[7]He famously quoted:“In order to make history one has to live; in order to live one has to eat; in order to eat one has to produce. Hence it is for the production that man has formed society”( and not the other way round)Economic structure is a “base” of all other structures. Only when the economic structure changes, the superstructure can be changed.Socialism was one of the stages of a transition from capitalism to communism.According to Marx, socialism will come through violent revolution and overthrow of capitalism. This was the transitional stage and communism will follow.In communism, the private property is abolished. Classes will be abolished and class struggle will end.When struggle ends following that dialectics end and following that history ends.Hence, it is said that the communism is the end of history.End of history meant the end of contradiction.In communism, the state shall wither away as the state was an instrument of the propertied class.Communism is a society where people get thing according to their needs.But you may now wonder that Marx might be opposite to industrialisation given he called it an instrument of the bourgeois. Marx supported industrialization and supported mass production by machines to fulfil the need of every person.Marx called communism a state of perfect freedom. Freedom from necessities. Man is free and he does what he wanted to do.Freedom in capitalist society is not free but it is false consciousness which leads to alienation and isolation.Conclusion:Socialism stood as an opposition to Capitalism.Karl Marx influenced socialism like no other and explained the economic structure and dictatorship of bourgeoisie through it. He wanted a revolution. He wanted a violent overthrow of capitalists. Marxism is a school based on Marx's idea which regarded socialism as a transition stage to communism.For Marx, communism is a state of freedom and away from false consciousness.[8]Charles Tips also answered this question beautifully: Charles Tips's answer to What's the difference between Socialism, Marxism and Communism?AFootnotes[1] Karl Marx (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy)[2] 1991: Economic Reforms[3] Socialism is like a hat that has lost its shape because  everybody wears i[4] C.E.M.

how do payroll companies make money	how companies make money	0	Like any business, payroll companies need to make a profit. But where does this profit come from?Most of it doesn't come from the invoices they submit to you -- this amount is minimal. Rather, they profit from floating the interest that is compounded on funds from your account before your payroll is paid out. Payroll companies typically will wait until the last possible minute to transfer your funds, and keep any interest earned on your money.However, because interest is so low now days, payroll services have had to be inventive in increasing their profits, just like any other company. It is no secret that vendors who bid on government contracts go in with unbelievably low bids to get the job. Where they make their money is with changes that come up during the building process which can cost double what the same job would have cost if it had been included in the original bid. This bidding process is used by a lot of industries. A company bids on a specific plan or service and somewhere along the line a CEO or division manager wants to make a change. Changes are how companies make more profit.Are you contributing to their bottom line?A payroll company also makes money from the frequency of your payroll plan. For example, a 20-employee company on a weekly pay schedule might spend $1,800 per year for payroll processing. But if that same company switched to a bi-weekly schedule, they would pay approximately $1,100. In short, providers benefit from how often they are providing a service to you.In addition, payroll firms rake in more cash by offering other payroll-related services, including payroll distribution, tax filing, data collection, and a newer, growing area -- benefit management services. Like a business searching for building bids it is in your best interest to look at your short term and long term needs. By adding a service into the original package you may negotiate favorable rates. However, if you add a service six months to a year or more after you have been with the payroll provider, the additional service may cost a lot more. Make a concerted effort to determine exactly what you need before accepting any packaged payroll services.Payroll service firms can also charge fees for extras like tailoring the format of reports generated with your payroll information. Almost all firms will accept a format that you suggest, if you can provide it on software that is compatible with their own.We are not advocating eliminating profits for a payroll provider. That would be absurd. However, the more insight you have on the profit source of payroll providers, the better you can choose an appropriate vendor. Done wisely, you can save some money and then re-invest your savings back into your own business.For more details you can visit our website- Payroll Managed Services | Payroll Services in India	No one has given you a full answer but Mr. Enright is the closest thus far. People seem to be focused on premium vs. claims; however, this is most definitely NOT how insurance companies make money. Most insurers try to price their policies such that the total premiums collected each year are equal to the total amount of claims paid + expenses (we call this the combined ratio - claims+expenses:premium). A combined ratio of 1 is seen as ideal because it means they are not over or under pricing their policies; meaning that they are underwriting the risks they want as pricing models are designed to attract what a company identifies as their target market. With regard to automobile insurance, most insurers actually run a loss on premiums, normally paying just over a dollar for every dollar of premium (combined ratio >1); whereas, they normally run just under a 1 ratio on property insurance. Ultimately, very little, if any profit is made through underwriting (premiums) alone; rather, the reason for writing policies and collecting premiums is to build an investment pool. When an insurer collects premiums they put that money into an investment pool. They use the premiums collected to fund investments (generally in guaranteed or low risk securities due to regulatory restrictions). When a claim is made money is then taken from that pool and put into a cash account to pay the claim once the adjustment of it is completed. Where insurers make their money is on the interest and return on investment earned from those premium dollars while they are in the investment pool. The ideal is to have enough premium coming in to keep the investment pool fully funded but the profit itself comes from the return on investment rather than a surplus in the premiums charged vs. claims and expenses paid. Let's look at State Farm Mutual for an example.... in 2011 State Farm collected $32,640,000,000 in premiums; they paid $22,794,000,000 in claims, $4,311,000,000 in claims expenses, $7,527,000,000 in administrative/service expenses; resulting in a LOSS of $1,993,000,000 on underwriting; however, they had investment income of $2.,901,000,000. So while they actually lost $1.9 Billion on premiums vs. claims and expenses (combined ratio of 1.06) they made $2.9 Billion on investement income. As you can see, insurers don't make money through premiums but through investment.
what are the most underrated and overrated movies you have  seen	what are the most overrated movies	0	DOCTOR STRANGEMost overrated i will say Doctor Strange because it was like seeing IRONMAN lookalike dawn the avatar of a super hero with power of magic and with same level of wit and humor and story line up also same .MCU is just trying to make up money by making this type of copy of there own movies by taking some other characters.I am not a hater of this movie as 3d effects were great and there was my one of the most beloved actor Benedict Cumberbatch but rather tan this i would have love to say the movie was great but that didn’t happened.THE GIRL WITH THE DRAGON TATTOOThis was well made novel adaptation of same name by the one of the gem of hollywood DAVID FINCHER. This movie had right to own more than just it got i know that it was received average by audience and critics but i see it as a classic in genre of thriller movies of all time and it should have earned more respect. Thats my point.Thanks for reading and do give your valuable suggestion if u think so. I know there are lot of movies but this two are the one which popped in my mind first. I will add more on basis of suggestion.	It has to be this :Dilwale ( Shah Rukh Khan )Dulhaniya ( Kajol )Le jayenge ( No. Her father let her go ) or else the title would bhi Dilwale Dulhaniya Nahi Leja Payenge.The Story is toooo cliche. It was released in the year 1995 when Hollywood was releasing films like Seven and Toy Story. Sharukh Khan plays the role of the son of a rich industrialist living in London who's friend circle is nothing more than a bunch of hobos. He's father is happy that he failed and thus sends him to a trip in Europe ( I wish my father was like him ). So our hero has nothing to do in a city like London but trouble an old man who runs a grocery shop near a petrol pump. This old man coincidentally happens to be the father of the woman with which our hero is going to fall madly in love. Yes why not? How are the writers going the show the struggle our hero will face to marry her? So the hero and the heroine meet in a train and travel to Switzerland because that's the only place Yash Chopra Films think what Europe looks like. So our hero and heroine obviously fall in love and decide that they're going to be would mates.Undoubtedly, the writers were forced to add a twist in the plot. So that twist is that the heroines father wants her to get married to an Indian guy ( because every Indian father thinks only indian guy's are perfect and pure souls ). No not even Raj, because he's an NRI. He should be pure Indian born and bought up in India with Indian cultural background. But hey, wasn't her daughter raised in London? What if he had a son as well? Would he force her to marry an Indian girl only? Typical Indian father.So he with his family lands in Punjab ( because that's where Yash Chopra is from ) . Raj who's desperate to bang Simran lands in Punjab at an uninvited wedding, at an unknown place, between unknown people and starts giggling around with them.So Simran wants to marry Raj, but Simran's father wants her to get married with the Indian guy, the Indian guy wants to marry Simran ( because she has a British degree ) , Raj wants to bang Simran, Raj's father wants an Indian daughter in law, Simran's mother is skeptical about Raj and Simran's sister's role has ended .After all this melodrama Simran's Father accept and tells her to catch the train and run away with Raj. Because he's the actual hero of the films without whom Raj couldn't do anything but wank.So this is the most overrated and popular Indian film because people still watch the 12–3 pm show at Maratha Mandir and has completed 550 weeks.Thank You.
for what use cases do you think deep learning and neural networks overkill and simpler models work better in practice	in deep q learning how we update the weight in neural network	0	Just software. As modular, portable and embedded as possible so it can run on phones, workstations, servers, and tiny form factor devices. Take advantage of both multi-core, and multi-machine mesh architectures as well as everything in between, where ever possible.	I see variants of this question alot so I will try to give a comprehensive and concise answer. It may be a bit lengthy.General Q Learning and Temporal Difference UpdateThe Q learning algorithm (including DQN) utilizes two components.It’s parametized by a state-action value function (or called the Q function), which is trying to learn to predict the expected accumulated sum of discounted reward until the end of a single trajectory (for example a single run in Atari)We update our parametized Q function towards the optimal Q function via temporal difference updates. This means at each time step, we adjust the parameters (weights in terms of neural networks) a little bit so the Q network prediction matchesMore concretely, the Q function is trying to approximate the expected accumulated sum of discounted rewards:𝑄(𝑠𝑡,𝑎𝑡)=𝑅𝑡=𝑟𝑡+𝛾⋅𝑟𝑡+1+𝛾2⋅𝑟𝑡+2+𝛾3⋅𝑟𝑡+3+…+𝛾⋅𝑟𝑡+𝑛Q(st,at)=Rt=rt+γ⋅rt+1+γ2⋅rt+2+γ3⋅rt+3+…+γ⋅rt+nQ(s_t,a_t) = R_t = r_t + \gamma \cdot r_{t+1}+\gamma^2 \cdot r_{t+2} + \gamma^3 \cdot r_{t+3} + \ldots + \gamma^ \cdot r_{t+n}You can start to see that, this is a regression problem, given your paramatized Q function (say a deep Cov net in the case of DQN) and a current state observation 𝑠𝑡sts_t and an action to take 𝑎𝑡ata_t, you try to adjust the weights of this neural network at every step so its predictions are closer towards the sum on the right hand side in equation above.But how do you get this sum in just one step? The equation doesn’t work because given the current state 𝑠𝑡sts_t and action 𝑎𝑡ata_t , we have to predict the future and know what is the reward at each step all the way until the end. The temporal difference method bypass this by introducing the Q function recursively on the right side as well. More specifically, the above equation is equivalent to the one below:𝑄(𝑠𝑡,𝑎𝑡)=𝑟𝑡+𝛾⋅𝑄𝑚𝑎𝑥(𝑠𝑡+1,𝑎𝑡+1)Q(st,at)=rt+γ⋅Qmax(st+1,at+1)Q(s_t, a_t) = r_t + \gamma \cdot Q_{max}(s_{t+1}, a_{t+1})You can see that if you expand the Q term on the right hand side it’s equivalent to the first equation.This is now interesting, by introducing the recursion, we now can update our Q function at every step instead of waiting until the end to sum up all the reward we received along the way.We finally have an update target to our regression problem. The procedure is simple, at every time step, we observe an initial state 𝑠𝑡sts_t, take an action 𝑎𝑡ata_t, and receive an immediate reward 𝑟𝑡rtr_t and we arrive at a new state 𝑠𝑡+1st+1s_{t+1}. Notice we now have everything we need to plug into the equation above. We adjust the weight of our Q network to minimize the MSE between the left and right hand side.DQNOne more point about paramerizing your DQN. In traditional Q learning you would have a Q network for each potential action. In DQN, they built their network so that it computes Q value for all actions in parallel. This is much more computational efficient. The difference is show below:With regards to DQN, you notice that the Q network is parametized in a way that it take state as input and computes q-values for all 𝑛nn actions given the state input. (diagram on the right). the Q network weight update is as follows, at every step:Given 𝑠𝑡sts_t , you run that forward through your Q network and outputs 𝑛nn linear output units (corresponding to 𝑛nn actions). Call this 𝐼=𝑄(𝑠𝑡)I=Q(st)I = Q(s_t)Given 𝐼II, you select an action 𝑎𝑡ata_t, via epsilon greedy (this means you have epsilon chance of selecting random action, or else select greedy action (max Q value/max value of 𝐼II). The epsilon is a value that starts at say 0.99 and gets annealed to a final value of 0.05 as the agent learns)You run your selected action through the environment (make sure you note which action index of 𝐼II you selected) , and receive from the environment the immediate reward 𝑟𝑡rtr_t and subsequent state 𝑠𝑡+1st+1s_{t+1} you end up in.You run the subsequent state 𝑠𝑡+1st+1s_{t+1} forward through your Q network. Call this 𝑂=𝑄(𝑠𝑡+1)O=Q(st+1)O = Q(s_{t+1}).Depending on whether 𝑠𝑡+1st+1s_{t+1} is terminal or not, the y_target that you optimize your Q network to regress to is: 𝑦𝑡𝑎𝑟𝑔𝑒𝑡=𝑟𝑡ytarget=rty_{target} = r_t if terminal, or 𝑦𝑡𝑎𝑟𝑔𝑒𝑡=𝑟𝑡+𝛾⋅𝑚𝑎𝑥𝑄(𝑠𝑡+1)ytarget=rt+γ⋅maxQ(st+1)y_{target} = r_t + \gamma \cdot maxQ(s_{t+1}) if non-terminal. Note 𝑚𝑎𝑥𝑄(𝑠𝑡+1maxQ(st+1maxQ(s_{t+1} is same as max of 𝑂OO.Take 𝐼II you computed in step 1, and replace it’s corresponding index for the action you selected with 𝑦𝑡𝑎𝑟𝑔𝑒𝑡ytargety_{target} . So in pseudo code this is 𝐼II[𝑎𝑡]=𝑦𝑡𝑎𝑟𝑔𝑒𝑡[at]=ytarget[a_t] = y_{target} Run the neural network package as you would do any regression problem. For example 𝑄𝑛𝑒𝑡𝑤𝑜𝑟𝑘.𝑓𝑖𝑡(𝑠𝑡,𝐼)Qnetwork.fit(st,I)Q_network.fit(s_t,I). In this case the input is 𝑠𝑡sts_t and regression target is 𝐼II, which has modified from step 6.
which one to learn c or c	which should i learn first c or c	1	"I've programmed a lot with both C and C++. I'm going to tell you something shocking (compared to the other answers, anyway):Don't learn C before C++.C++ has diverged so far from C, that learning C first won't gain you much of anything, and there will be lots of things you have to unlearn if you want to be good at C++. For example:The standard I/O library in C is called stdio; the standard I/O library in C++ is called IOStreams. You generally don't want to use stdio in C++ code: it's not extensible, and it's type-unsafe.C-style casts is the only casting style that you can use in C, but its use is frowned upon in C++; one should always prefer C++-style casts (static_cast, dynamic_cast, etc.), which are much safer.Also, C++ makes a much, much bigger deal of RAII (which doesn't exist in C) and const-correctness than C does. You will want to get those right from day one.Yes, eventually if you get to an advanced level of C++, you will want to learn about how some C++ features (e.g., RTTI, exceptions, etc.) are implemented at a low level, and knowing C may help with that. But that's not for beginners, for sure. C++ beginners should just learn high-level C++ concepts, and leave low-level C concepts out of it.One of my favourite books that teaches C++ at this high level is Accelerated C++. It is an oldie but a goodie: ""It remains one of the best books around"", C++ expert James Kanze says.Another book I want to suggest is Programming—Principles and Practice Using C++ by Bjarne Stroustrup; I haven't read that particular book, but I have read a couple of other C++ titles by Stroustrup and really liked them."	I think it all depends on the intention. How do you intend to use the language? Let us use an analogy of cooking to programming. The daily mealLet us assume you just moved to a new city away from home and haven't made yourself much useful in the kitchen at home so far because usually Mom and occasionaly Dad used to cook for the family. After spending half your travel allowances on food in the new city, You want to be able to satisfy your hunger when the restaurants seem to be an inefficient way of obtaining food in the long term and you decide it is time you learn cooking. The last thing you want to do is pick up a guide to cooking French Cuisine or Sushi. You start with the basics. Learn to identify the ingredients (vegetables, meats, oils, spices, cereals and so on). And you begin cooking in a month's time, very much self dependent. You won't be able to cook like any of those Michelin Star restaurants but you will have decent food in your plate everyday. However, on the plus side, you will learn the most fundamental knowledge. This experience is like programming in C. It is useful for small tasks for specific use cases. But it is nowhere close to cooking anything elaborate. The did make an entire OS out of C (Unix/Linux ) which has been in use for the last 4 decades now but it is an exceptional case. If the original programmers were to write Unix now, C would, in my opinion, not be their first choice). On the other hand, you learn to programme the way a computer sees it. And it works very fast as you skip all the bells and whistles. The street food vendorYou move to a new city. You want to cook food for yourself and you want to run a typical food shack, coking food. You optimize things, you prepare for recipies in advance of your opening times. It takes a bit longer to prepare all your items but when a customers order a plate of noodles, it doesnt take you more then 10 minutes to serve them piping hot noodles. You can manage cooking dozens of items within a few minutes. Once you kept multiple stoves running simultaneously, all cooking different items for you, but then you ended up adding diced chicken into an order of vegan soup and two servings of salt into the same order. So you decided to use the extra stoves only when you had no other option.This is like programming in C++. Writing classes for every little thing is time consuming but when you use them, it is faster to write your functionality into you application. It is more managable and suitable for larger applications then your ad hoc program needs, but you are likely to make mistake that are not easy to fix. Also long term maintainance becomes a hassle.The fast food retail chainYou found a job at a fast food chain. So you have a lot of standard ingredients to use. You dont know how they were made and frankly, you do not care. Many of them are obtained from various factories elsewhere. However, you undestand their proper use. There are a lot of conventions and rules you follow, some written, some learnt from your experiences. It would take you days to prepare the ingredients if youhad to do them yourself. However, you dont have to.. someone else is making them for your chain. You just need to know which ones to mix and match to get what. However, you are able to manage mutiple orders at once. the store is able to deliver hundereds of items every hour.This is where C# is useful. It is useful for enterprise platforms having several million lines of code. It does not drive you mad to manage all of that magnitude. However if you were to write a simple program to show current time on the screen, it would take you a much larger code structure to run the process, build it and execute it SummaryC: suitable for simple tasks but not suitable for a large applicationC++: suitable for medium applications but usually verbose for small tasksC#: suitable for large apps and also suitable for enterprise platforms/applications. Not very useful for one of small tasksImplications for a beginerAlthough from the above discussion it may seem that one must start with C, move on to C++ and finally learn using C# that is not correct. This illustration is not of a journey to learn progrmming. It is an illustration of what the intention of the programmer is with the language. There is nothing wrong with starting with C# directly, however it is a longer, slower but step by step understanding of programming principles if one goes through the entire sequence of learning which has its own benefits.
will a fitbit accurately track my activity if i am riding a bike	what is the most accurate wearable item for activity  on the market today ie jawbone or fitbit	0	"No.  The sensor is not good enough.  Same issue for Jawbone's UP and Nike Fuel.  The swing of your arm or bounce of your body clocks the steps...it won't pick up the movement on a bike.  You still need to get a bike computer (pretty cheap and reasonable) to mount to your handle bars.  You can also get a ton more data out of more advanced technology on your bike.  Wattometers such as SRM and Power Meters will show you real time power output, speed, RPMs and heart rate.Update: I've used the Nike Fuel band for the past week now and though it does not track your distance on a bike (moving, not stationary), it does give you ""credit"" for activity with their proprietary/bespoke metric they are calling the ""FUEL SCORE.""  It also seems to do a decent job of tracking calories burned.  I compared, for example, my KJ burn from my SRM powermeter to the calories burned on my Fuel Band, it the two numbers were pretty close.  I've been more impressed with this device than I thought I would be."	I've pretty much tried them all: Fitbit's different models, Jawbone UP/UP24, Basis B1 and Peak, Withings, Bodymedia, Nike Fuelband, Misfit Shine, Amiigo and Flyfit to name a few.Apart from the Amiigo which is scary inaccurate considering that it has two datapoints (wrist and ankle) and the Flyfit which I'm not sure about yet, I have to say that the others are accurate enough when it comes to steps. Wearing two different devices will at the end of the day show a discrepancy between the two depending on where you've worn them. Wrist worn devices like Jawbone, Basis and Misfit Shine are worse at tracking movement when you don't move your arms very much (e.g. pushing a stroller, carrying a heavy bag). In general, I tend to find pocket worn devices more accurate when it comes to steps.To be honest, if you want to track your steps, an iPhone 5S or 6 is enough as it has the M8 chip that automagically tracks your activity with very low battery usage. You can use the Health Book app to see your movement data.When it comes to other activity, so far the only tracker that is somewhat good at automatically (without any input from me) detecting that I'm doing something else (running, biking) is the Basis Peak. That's not to say it's good: I think it's a major fail that a tracker that has access to my heart rate cannot predict that I'm exercising when I'm for example boxing which is a repetitive pattern that should be easy to discern (to compare, the Moov which is an activity coach can coach both boxing, running and swimming).As for sleeping, no activity tracker on the market today is accurate, simply because they don't have access to enough data points.
what is the best evidence for a historical jesus	what is the evidence for and against the existence of the historical jesus	1	[Originally asked: Is there any archaeological proof that Jesus existed?]YES.There is more archaeological proof for Jesus’ existence than for virtually any other figure from ancient history.There’s an abundance of corroborating archaeological evidence; a great amount of the people, cities, places, etc. of Jesus’ life and ministry are established in the archaeological record. I’ll summarize a lot of that at the end of this answer.But when it comes to Jesus specifically, the best proof we have is the Bible.Many people will object here. They will deny that the Bible can ever be used as proof of Jesus.But this question doesn’t get to make that objection. You asked for archaeological evidence of Jesus’ existence, and the Bible fits the bill perfectly.This wasn’t always the case. Back when the King James Version was first translated from the Greek (roughly 400 years ago in 1611 A.D/C.E.), they had reference to perhaps a dozen Greek manuscripts of the New Testament. None of these were particularly old; they were removed from the time of Jesus by many hundreds, if not a thousand, years.In such a situation, you could imagine all sorts of changes occurring in the text between the time it was first written to the time it was translated.But then came archaeology.In the last 150 years, archaeologists have dug up thousands of ancient biblical manuscripts. Today we have over 10,000 manuscripts of the New Testament in the original languages, stretching back in time to the early 2nd and late 1st centuries.In all of this, there is no evidence of the content changing over time.There are minor scribal issues, of course. There will always be minor copy issues when human agents perform the copying. But given the abundance of manuscripts, we can easily spot and correct these changes.The evidence is so strong that even Bart Ehrman, one of the staunchest skeptics around, agrees. Out of the nearly 8,000 verses in the New Testament, Ehrman might quibble on perhaps a dozen, and none of these affect the teaching or beliefs of Christianity. They’re all exceedingly minor issues. (For a complete interview with Ehrman on this subject, consult the appendix of Ehrman’s book Misquoting Jesus, which establishes this information and much more).What does all this have to do with archaeological proof for Jesus?Everything.Consider the impact of these three facts, all of which archaeology has established for the New Testament:It was written during the lifetimes of the eye-witnesses to Jesus.It was published in the lands where the events happened, while tens of thousands of eye-witnesses could put the lie to anything in them that wasn’t accurate.It was not changed over time; the content of the New Testament today is the same as when it was first written.All this happened during a time when Jesus’ enemies held all the power and tried to destroy Christianity in any way possible. And yet they never charged the Bible with any kind of inaccuracy, nor did they attempt to argue that Jesus didn’t exist.Robert Van Voorst searched the first few centuries A.D./C.E and concluded clearly:“… [N]o pagans and Jews who opposed Christianity denied Jesus’ historicity or even questioned it.”(Van Voorst, Jesus Outside, p. 15)He elaborates:“… [I]f anyone in the ancient world had a reason to dislike the Christian faith, it was the rabbis. To argue successfully that Jesus never existed but was a creation of early Christians would have been the most effective polemic against Christianity … [Yet] all Jewish sources treated Jesus as a fully historical person … [T]he rabbis … used the real events of Jesus’ life against him”(Van Voorst, Jesus Outside, pp. 133–134, emphasis added)Jesus’ enemies unintentionally did Him a great service: they corroborated the accounts written about Him.

how do the pm and prez get women	i worked for 1month and absconded from accenture within bond period will they take any legal actionwill it effect when joining other company	0	Its is none other than Raja Digvijaya Singh !!Confused ?First of all, it is one of the biggest misconception that Shri Rahul Rajiv Indira Jawaharlal Motilal Gandhi is the PM candidate of Congress. Rahul ji was never interested in that post, neither he was born for such a small post. Rahul ji will be the next NAC Chairman when Congress returns.Now, why Digvijay ji among all other Congress man ? Here are the reasons :Aggressive leader : Digvijay ji is the Indian answer to Vladimir Putin. You simply dont wanna mess with him or confront him face to face.Once a person waived his slippers at one of Diggy sir’s party man. Guess what happened ? Diggy sir did this :Now, just imagine Chinese President Xi Jinping in place of this protestor !!A young worker from opposition youth organization once dared to show a black flag to Diggy sir to protest against one of his remarks. Result :Court grants bail to Digvijay Singh, MP in assault case2. Inspiration to youth : Did I say that he is India’s answer to only Vladimir Putin ? Digvijay Singh is India’s answer to Bill Clinton, Nicholas Sarkozy and Silvio Berlusconi as well :While most of us easily give up after a couple of rejections or break-ups and are not able to start from new, Diggy sir has set a perfect example by starting fresh at 69 (the age) with Amrita Rai ji who is only 28 years younger than him. They have set a perfect example : love is pure, love knows no age, love knows no society. It is selfless.Besides, he has inspired millions of Indian engineers like me that an engineer can woo a beautiful girl, even if it gets as late as 69 years but an engineer should never give up and keep on hitting on beautiful women till he succeeds ! ( Diggy sir is an engineer).In video below, Diggy sir calls his party colleague as ‘tunch maal’. Which woman wont fall for such catchy lines !!In his spare time, Diggy sir frequently promotes classical Indian culture amongst youth and provides a “platform” to talented young artists :3. International Diplomacy : Most Indian leaders make the mistake of trying to get in the good books of US Prez, UK PM or Japan’s PM. What they dont realize that these countries will anyway come to India because India is a huge market. Diggy sir is a bit different. He due to his secular nature, is in good books of terrorist leaders.When Osama Bin Laden was killed, all world leaders expressed happiness for his death. Only Diggy sir stood for the right thing, he mourned for Laden.Digvijay Singh calls 'Osama Bin Laden' as 'Osama Ji' - IBTLHe addressed Laden sir as Osama ji (ji is a term used with a person’s name to show respect). Similarly, when Pakistani terrorists trained their ass off, crossed border and sacrificed their lives to slain Indian civilians on 26/11, Diggy sir instead gave the credit of all their hard work to an organization called RSS (Rashtriya Swayam sevak Sangh), which mostly comprises of his political opponents.Now, imagine yourself in place of Al-Zawahiri (Al-Qaeda chief). You are planning to attack India and give a message that Sharia is coming to India soon. But you have a person leading India, who has only respect for you, your organization and your ex-boss. He is more Muslim than most of you out there. Besides that, you also know that all credit of your hardwork will go to RSS and your message that the age of hardcore Sharia Islam has arrived in India will go nowhere. Here your guy dies in the name of 72 virgins and there the Indian PM refuses to acknowledge that instead saying that the guy was a Hindu terrorist and died in the name of idol-worship. What do you do in this situation ? How will you motivate your Al-Qaeda cadre to kill Indians ? How will you tell them to harm the country men of Osama fan Diggy ? You can’t. Hence, he will have to spare India.Similarly, Diggy sir has registered himself in good books of Islamic scholar Zakir Naik (the person ...	yes they might do it. I’m not sure why you’ve absconded when you are thinking about joining other companies. Generally they don’t do it if it were just one month or people in training absconding as many fail to complete training. Bond will be signed only after training is complete. If you did sign the bond and then worked for 1 month and absconded then they have every right to take legal action and will most probably do.Most people abscond as they would go for further education or govt jobs so they won’t be back in IT . I Don’t think it would be a problem as long as you are away from IT. So i’m not sure why you did it. Just hope they don’t give a damn about you and don’t go that route …all the best :)

what is the name of the song in which picturized on madhuri dixit and ranbir kapoor and is from which movie	what is the name of the song in which salman khan teases madhuri dixit by using a slingshot and is from which movie	0	The horrible fashion sense of the 1980s could not hide the sparkle that was Madhuri Dixit. An actress par excellence, an amazing dancer and the one-with-the million dollar smile, Madhuri  has been lucky to be featured in some really beautiful song compositions that have gained more beauty because of her exceptional dancing skills.Ek do teen, a song sung by Alka Yagnik, was from where everything started. Madhuri Dixit’s joyous moves in this song in the movie ‘Tezaab’ were choreographed by master choreographer Saroj Khan and created a sensation in the country.Ek Do Teen​Dhak Dhak , a song sung by Anuradha Paudhwal and Udit Narayanan from the hit movie ‘Beta’ is another iconic song where Saroj Khan again showcased  Madhuri’s sexy side with some bosom thrusts and subtle lighting. Her orange sari and blouse and chemistry with Anil Kapoor are still remembered.Dhak Dhak​Madhuri danced to the koli number Hum Ko Aaj Tak Hai with such gusto that people forgot the movie and just looked at her. This song sung by Anupama Deshpande for the forgettable movie ‘ Sailaab’ made full play of her enticing expressions and body language.Hum Ko Aaj Kal Hai​Didi Tera Dewar Deewana from the movie ‘Hum Aapke Hain Kaun…!’ is sung by Lata Mangeshkar and S.P. Balasubramaniam, is one of those dance numbers that exhibitsher playful side. Her much copied blouse and purple sari were a huge hit with the ladies and the song became a fixture at weddings.Didi Tera Dewar Deewana​The not-so-successful and grim ‘Anjaam’ boasted of the immensely playful ‘Chane Ke Khet Mein’. Her expressions in this song sung by Poornima were copied by girls of all ages and so were her moves.Chane Ke Khet Mein​Choli ke Peeche created a huge controversy because of its lyrics, but the popularity of this song sung by Ila Arun and Alka Yagnik was propelled mainly because of Madhuri’s dancing and its folk based beats. ‘Khalnayak’ is still remembered for this Madhuri number.Choli Ke Peeche Kya Hai​Lavish sets and a beautiful courtesan, Madhuri dressed in a heavy period costume whirling toMaar daala in ‘Devdas’ remains an indelible memory in Madhuri’s many fans’ minds. Her classical dance based steps in this Kavita Krishnamurthy sung song clearly tells us what a brilliant dancer she really is.Maar Daala​Dekha Hai Pehli Baar is another hit song Of Madhuri’s sung by Alka Yagnik and S.P. Balasubramaniam. This romantic song from the super hit movie ‘Saajan’ shows a young Madhuri in the throes of young love.Dekha Hai Pehli Baar​Akhiyan Milaun is a great dance number picturised on Madhuri and Sanjay Kapoor in the movie ‘Raja’. Her fun expressions and funky dance moves made this song a huge hit. The song was well sung by Alka Yagnik and Udit Narayanan.Akhiyan Milaun...

what is the function of nucleoplasm in a plant cell	what is the function of centrosomes in plant cells	0	Nucleoplasm is made primarily of water, ions and a various mixture of other molecules. It is a fairly sticky liquid that is completely enclosed within the nuclear membrane. It serves as a suspension medium for all of the organelles inside the nucleus, and it also helps maintain the shape and structure of the nucleus.	None. Plant (and fungus) cells have no centrosomes. See Wikipedia (Centrosome):Fungi and plants lack centrosomes and therefore use other MTOC structures to organize their microtubules.
can fossil records be used as evidence for evolution if so how	what are some examples of evidence of evolution that fossil records provide	1	"Well, in fact, the best evidence for evolution in the fossil record is all of it. Let me explain.I'll start with the story of a precambrian bunny. The precambrian bunny is a mythical creature. It wandered the earth, nomming on the Ediacaran fauna. Stuff like: Arkarua adamiand Charnia masoni, a tasty little thing that may look like a fern, but in fact lived in water so deep that photosynthesis was not possible. Our bunny was  good swimmer.Okay, this is rather absurd. It's perfectly understandable that bunnies could not have lived during this period of time. Of course, if you think about it, why is it that scientists can recognize that different forms of life lived in different periods of time? Why is it, that the further back in time you go, the less life looks like it does today?We can start with geology. Strata are laid down horizontally, and form under a lot of different conditions. Limestone, for instance, is made up of the ""skeletal fragments of organisms"" or ""by the chemical precipitation of calcite or aragonite""Sandstone is made from, well, sand. ""[T]he sand becomes sandstone when it is compacted by pressure of overlying deposits and cemented by the precipitation of minerals within the pore spaces between sand grains.""So, what's the point. Well, the strata that fossils are found within can tell us about the environment in which they lived. And since strata are laid down horizontally, the deeper the stratum the further back in time it was deposited. This, absent any absolute dating techniques can provide a rough, relative age of the fossils.That was geology. Now lets talk Phylogeny. Phylogeny is the study of how species are related to each other. A phylogenic tree is a picture of how life is related. The further away from the branches (which are modern species or dead ends) the further back in time. This is because, necessarily, the descendants of a population must come after it's ancestors.From this we can draw the conclusions that stratigraphy should correlate with phylogeny. In general we should find ancestors lower in the stratigraphic record than we find descendants. This is why a precambrian bunny is so absurd. Bunnies are a recent species, the precambrian ended about 540 million years ago.But putting the bunny aside, we can get back to the general case: the correlation between stratigraphy and phylogeny. Because the fossil record is messy and because biology is messy, this is a necessarily statistical science.This excellent essay discusses this issue, 29+ Evidences for Macroevolution.Here is a quote of a quote within this essay:""... the RCI and SCI metrics showed impressive left-skewing; the majority of cladograms tested show good congruence between cladistic and stratigraphic information. Cladists and stratigraphers may breathe easy: the cladistic method appears, on the whole, to be finding phylogenies that may be close to the true phylogeny of life, and the sequence of fossils in the rocks is not misleading. ... it would be hard to explain why the independent evidence of the stratigraphic occurrence of fossils and the patterns of cladograms should show such striking levels of congruence if the fossil record and the cladistic method were hopelessly misleading."" (Benton and Hitchin 1997, p. 889)So, the end result is this. If evolution is true, then it is necessary that the order that fossils are laid down in the fossil record correlates with how those fossils are related. And when the whole fossil record is examined and measured against this expectation, it fits. In essence, all the fossil evidence supports evolution. How much more evidence would you need than all if it."	"Well, in fact, the best evidence for evolution in the fossil record is all of it. Let me explain.I'll start with the story of a precambrian bunny. The precambrian bunny is a mythical creature. It wandered the earth, nomming on the Ediacaran fauna. Stuff like: Arkarua adamiand Charnia masoni, a tasty little thing that may look like a fern, but in fact lived in water so deep that photosynthesis was not possible. Our bunny was  good swimmer.Okay, this is rather absurd. It's perfectly understandable that bunnies could not have lived during this period of time. Of course, if you think about it, why is it that scientists can recognize that different forms of life lived in different periods of time? Why is it, that the further back in time you go, the less life looks like it does today?We can start with geology. Strata are laid down horizontally, and form under a lot of different conditions. Limestone, for instance, is made up of the ""skeletal fragments of organisms"" or ""by the chemical precipitation of calcite or aragonite""Sandstone is made from, well, sand. ""[T]he sand becomes sandstone when it is compacted by pressure of overlying deposits and cemented by the precipitation of minerals within the pore spaces between sand grains.""So, what's the point. Well, the strata that fossils are found within can tell us about the environment in which they lived. And since strata are laid down horizontally, the deeper the stratum the further back in time it was deposited. This, absent any absolute dating techniques can provide a rough, relative age of the fossils.That was geology. Now lets talk Phylogeny. Phylogeny is the study of how species are related to each other. A phylogenic tree is a picture of how life is related. The further away from the branches (which are modern species or dead ends) the further back in time. This is because, necessarily, the descendants of a population must come after it's ancestors.From this we can draw the conclusions that stratigraphy should correlate with phylogeny. In general we should find ancestors lower in the stratigraphic record than we find descendants. This is why a precambrian bunny is so absurd. Bunnies are a recent species, the precambrian ended about 540 million years ago.But putting the bunny aside, we can get back to the general case: the correlation between stratigraphy and phylogeny. Because the fossil record is messy and because biology is messy, this is a necessarily statistical science.This excellent essay discusses this issue, 29+ Evidences for Macroevolution.Here is a quote of a quote within this essay:""... the RCI and SCI metrics showed impressive left-skewing; the majority of cladograms tested show good congruence between cladistic and stratigraphic information.

could cat exam and mat exam take place on same day 4th december 2016	is it necessary to learn vedic maths and spending time on short tricks for cat 2016 exam	0	You clone yourself in the next 4 months, and then go sit for both exams at the same time.What is with this question popping up like crazy every five minutes since the CAT announcement came out?On a serious note, it is obvious that this arrangement will be changed. Either the CAT or the IIFT exam will be postponed/preponed. There is no way both of them will have the same scheduled date. Most probably the IIFT exam will be changed, given how it’s the exam that fewer people take compared to CAT.	Vehicle maths was necessary when the exam used to be Cal intensive.  With the new changes in the pattern from this year onwards,  you'll be provided with an on screen scientific calculator in the exam,  much like Gmat and the paper is predicted to more logic oriented.  Having said that,  if you're preparing for cat 16,  you have a lot of time at hand as of now,  and it's never harmful to learn how to calculate quicker.  So you can definitely start with basic vedic maths,  but it's definitely not a need anymore.  Shortcuts in terms of different concepts and questions would be more useful.
what mythical creatures are in the bible	what do mythical creatures eat	0	"Lots of creatures like Giants, Dragons, Unicorns, Cockatrice etc are mentioned.The greatest of all the beasts in the Bible is the Leviathan. This dragon-like creature features in all the pre-Biblical pagan mythologies of the Near East and even in India.God describes the Leviathan — a many-headed fire-breathing Sea-Dragon.Job 41:1 Moreover the Lord answered Job out of the whirlwind saying; "" ….. His teeth are terrible round about...... His appearance is full of light, and his eyes are like the rays of the dawn. Out of his mouth go burning lamps, and sparks of fire leap out. Out of his nostrils goes smoke, like a flame, spreading around the sides of a pot. His breath kindles coals, and a flame goes out of his mouth...... His meat is good and fat and it is nourishing.... Because of the fear of him, the mighty are afraid; and the strong are humbled............He brings to destruction whatever is proud. He is the King over all things in the deep.God fights with the Sea-Dragon and kills it.Ps. 74:13–14. It was you who split open the sea by your power; you broke the heads of the monster in the waters. It was you who crushed the heads of Leviathan and gave him as food to the creatures of the desert.Isa. 27:1 In that day the LORD with his sore and great and strong sword shall punish leviathan the piercing serpent, even leviathan that crooked serpent; and he shall slay the dragon that [is] in the sea.War in heaven between the angels and the dragonRev. 12:7 – 9. And there was war in heaven. Michael and his angels fought against the dragon, and the dragon and his angels fought back. But he was not strong enough, and they lost their place in heaven. The great dragon was hurled down — that ancient serpent called the devil, or Satan, who leads the whole world astray. He was hurled to the earth, and his angels with him.This is the same dragon that appears in the Canaanite mythology as Lotan which is killed by the god Hadad. In Mesopotamian religion it was Tiamat defeated by the god Marduk. In India it was Vrtra who was slain by Indra and in Norse mythology it was Jormungandr who was killed by Thor.Then there are the four beastly visions Ezekiel 1:4 – 12.The four living creatures. In appearance their form was that of a man, but each of them had four faces and four wings. Their legs were straight; their feet were like those of a calf and gleamed like burnished bronze. Under their wings on their four sides they had the hands of a man. All four of them had faces and wings, and their wings touched one another. Each one went straight ahead; they did not turn as they moved.Their faces looked like this: Each of the four had the face of a man, and on the right side each had the face of a lion, and on the left the face of an ox; each also had the face of an eagle. Such were their faces. Their wings were spread out upwards; each had two wings, one touching the wing of another creature on either side, and two wings covering its body. Each one went straight ahead. Wherever the spirit would go, they would go, without turning as they went.Rev.4:6 Also before the throne there was what looked like a sea of glass, clear as crystal. In the centre, around the throne, were four living creatures, and they were covered with eyes, in front and behind. 7. The first living creature was like a lion, the second was like an ox, the third had a face like a man, the fourth was like a flying eagle. 8. Each of the four living creatures had six wings and was covered with eyes all around, even under his wings. Day and night they never stop saying: ""Holy, holy, holy is the Lord God Almighty, who was, and is, and is to come."" 9. Whenever the living creatures give glory, honour and thanks to him who sits on the throne and who lives for ever and ever.Revelation 13:1-4 The beast from the sea.The BEHEMOTH“Behold, Behemoth, which I made as I made you; he eats grass like an ox. Behol..."	Weird question, because there is not ONE answer to this…You have so many different answers, it will depend on what creature we are talking about…Many legends did not clearly established what the creature ate…except if that had a great importance. For instance vampires = suck blood. This was important. But it had never been important to stress what some other creature ate. For instance who can tell precisely what a hobgoblin eats ?Some creatures are clearly carnivorous, and dangerous because they love human flesh. Some of them even love the flesh of human children (ogres, or those old witches we can call hags or crones…)Griffins were supposed to attack horses, thats what made them dangerous in the very old legends about them: they attacked horses, and also the guy who was riding on the horse.Other creatures were supposed to be omnivorous and to eat exactly the same kind of things we do. Dwarves for instance. As to the Brownies and all the other representatives of what we call the “Little Folk” they loved when you left milk or cream. If you did so, they could miraculously help you night time (cleaning your house etc.)
which one is good oral anal or vaginal sex	we had consensual sex then he forced me into having anal sex if i press charges will the fact that i consented to sex vaginally ruin my case	0	Decisions, decisions!What do I like more? Ice cream or donut or eclair? It’s a tough call to make.I love getting down on my knees and performing oral sex just as much as bending over. And that is not to say that I’ve any love lost for spreading my legs either. In fact, in my ideal sex session, I ensure I integrate a little of all to keep it interesting. But if I were forced to choose one, then I’ll choose donut. I mean anal sex.When I was young I was hammered home that anal sex is dirty and bad. When I was in college and was becoming more promiscuous I was told that only dirty girls with lose morals become team anal. When I started dating, a guy was rather surprised when I initiated it just because he seemed rather too infatuated with my derriere.So, why do I like it so much? Perhaps it’s psychological: that it is dirty, that only dirty women do it, that I get to surprise and arouse my partner by willingly guiding him there.Perhaps it’s physical: that I’m in love with the intoxicating pain that comes with inexplicable pleasure; that it has the ability to make me orgasm in just a few strokes; that it makes me embrace the wilder side.Or perhaps, it’s because I just love having anal sex. Simple and clear.	These are the kind of questions I would never want to see on Quora. If he raped you, you press charges immediately. And I mean as soon as he’s gone. If you didn’t like anal sex and you are regretting to have done it, though, keep it in mind for the future: there’s no need to ruin someone’s life for your own mistakes. But hey…if he forced you that’s called rape and nothing can ruin your case, but the time you are wasting by asking on Quora.
what are the winter weather conditions like in cincinnati oh	what is the weather like during winter in tel aviv	0	Winters are usually pretty mild. However we can get some real cold snaps. Winters usually are fairly light on precipitation but sometimes we can get hit with a massive snow storm. There are frequent breaks in the cold temperatures and it can hit even as high as 60 on some sunny days in the winter. Overall, its really up and down. You can never tell. Although I will say this, get ready for some long spells of cloudy weather. The gloom is sometimes palpable!	I once spent three months over autumn and winter in Tel Aviv.  Coming from the UK it felt very mild. Yes it certainly was cool but there were still some sunny days. You do need to wear a coat or jacket.  I'm not sure the Israelis agreed with me on the mildness though and they definitely felt a clear drop in temperature compared to their summers.

Hello I will only tell you about some shares hereFirst up let me tell you that most of the stocks that I will tell you are those which I have personally invested in and there will be some that I can’t afford that I will tell you also and some more small cap mid cap shres that I preffer but at this point of time I can not because of my previous investments and also that I am still a student and entirely dependent on my parents for money supportSo here we gopunjab national bank :- With nirav modi arrest in london this share is going to blast stock exhange for sure i highly recommend to buy this share comming friday and it could go up to 130–140 / share and this could be a great great investmentAfter the nirav modi news around 2,00,00,000 shares were traded within 30 mins so that way you can see how vast and large the market cap is and recently this share touched its 52 week high2. Axis bank:- Surely one of the best stocks of banking sector and believe me it is going to trade in 4 digits very soon with the new management that has joined in the bank and people are liking it to a great extent and the balance sheet of the bank has improved over the yearsYou can see in the image motilal oswal has given a target of 875 and after reaching there it could further go to 4 digits so I highly recommend it to who so ever can afford the investmentAs you can see the share has been a constant dividend giver and the dividend has increased constantly at a slow pace over the years3. Ashok leyland:- This is another stock that has declined 45% over the past year and this seems to be the best time to purchase this stockThis company has huge growth prospects in the comming years and can prove to be a great investment if you could hold it for say 6–8 months or even a year4. Icici bank:- Another private bank that has great growth prospects in the comming years is icici bank my suggestion would be a target of 500 and even 600 afterwardsIt touched a high of 438 once and is looking very determined to break it in the comming monthsNow i would go to real estate sector as the gst has been reduced on it and the sales is definately goona increase and those people who have lost confidence in investment in real estate sector will again take real estate sector as a good opportunity to invest in1 of my picks in real estate sector would be :-godrej properties :- another share on which I can bet that will reach 4 figures very soon its just a matter of time for this shareIt rallied 62 rupees in a day so this way you can imagine what kind of impact it will have with gst reducing on property and getting implemented from april so from april you will see a further upward trend and my target will be 1050 till mayThose who feel that there is something in it kindly please upvote ……..
how do we improve reading skills of children	how do i improve my reading skill	0	Give them different kinds of books, picture books, stories, as well as science and humanities in such forms. Let the children choose their favorite 'brand' till they pick up a habit of seeking enjoyment with books. This habit will remain with them in good stead, whichever path they happen to follow in later years.Keep a dictionary, net or suitable reference handy and encourage them to clear doubts as and when they arise.Always ensure best conditions for reading. This is one thing the can cause a hurdle, especially for children, and they may not even sense or express any difficulty.	"First, be clear why you want to increase your reading. If it is because of a vague feeling that you ""should"" be reading because everyone says so, my advice would be to just throw the should out and go and do what makes you happy. However, if you really want to read for yourself, I would probe into why you want that. Examples.1. Keep up with the state of the art in your field. If this is the objective, then spend an hour planning exactly what you need to keep up to speed on, and figure out the most efficient way. It might well not involve reading at all, or just reading small pieces such as blog posts. That is fine. What matters is that you got the job done with the least amount of effort possible. I would call that a win. The key is to have some sort of a roadmap or outline in advance that will guide you of what you need to master, and how well you need to master it. 2. You need to improve your ability to absorb and assimilate lots of written material because of your job, or requirements as a researcher etc. If this is the case, practice is the best way to go, and don't set yourself up for disappointment by expecting it to be a ton of fun, at least initially. Instead, start with a small goal of an easy to understand technical book similar to what you will be required to read and understand. Set a small target, say reading the book with focus for 10 minutes everyday. The key here is to make yourself a more active participant by taking notes, an outline, creating a mind map or otherwise generally engaging with the material as if you were required to teach it to a class the next day. Over time you will become really good and might even start to enjoy it3. Acquire a classical education. This translates into reading what used to be called the great books, and generally heavy but not technical material. In my view, this is the hardest and yet most rewarding type of reading. A good rule is to start with an engaging commentary on a classic, for example, any of Mortimer Adler's books. Again, the key is to engage start small, and read with an open yet inquiring mind. I have found in these cases that trying to summarize in my own words briefly what the writer is trying to say improves my understanding by orders of magnitude. Slower, no doubt, but richly rewarding, provided you pick the right books.4. Read  lighter nonfiction to keep up with friends etc. As an example, popular history, current affairs, popular science etc. Jared Diamond's books would be a good example of this genre. The outline and question technique I mentioned above will work very well here. However, the trade off is the time you spend versus the return you get. In general,unless you have a deep and abiding interest in the subject, my experience is that it is not worth my time to take that level of effort. I also don't feel compelled to finish the book from start to the last page. Again comes down to what you hope to accomplish by reading the book. I am assuming that pure pleasure is not the main reason because if it were, you would not have asked the question. If you just want to be able to follow the conversation of intelligent peers, then a glance at the main chapter heads, the foreword or introduction should give you a rough grasp of what you need to read to meet your goals. If it turns out to be gripping you can always go back to the beginning and finish it. The important thing is to not let the reading become a silent tyrant over you, draining your energy. You get to decide what makes the most sense to do for that book, given your objective.5. Read fiction for enjoyment. If this is your goal, try to pick up something really light that appeals to your natural interests. Keep trying different genres until you find something that clicks.please do not start with War and Peace. Then when the pleasure you get from reading a well crafted story exceeds whatever challenge you have currently in reading, then slowly go into more challenging areas. Taking a literature appreciation class in a really good school will help you get ""infected"" with the teacher's enthusiasm. In addition, there are great videos and online courses that in many cases are available for free that cover great literature. Dip your toe in gently to see if it works.6. If all else fails  and you are still desperate, gamify. Set your target, and set yourself a reward that you truly want, and give yourself that reward upon meeting that target. For example, you can buy yourself something you have been wanti if you finish War and Peace from start to finish.Hope this helps. Happy reading!"

do you lose nutrients  and  calories when you have diarrhea	will eating 2000 calories a day make me lose weight	0	"Answering your second question (I'd agree with others here that the answer to your first question is yes), the answer is, probably a couple hundred calories a day, but it varies. Here's why: The probiotic bacteria in your gut usually convert some of the fiber you can't digest into sugars that you can. There can be more available sugar in a bowl of oat bran cereal than in a bowl of ice cream if you have the right bacteria to digest the fiber. When you have diarrhea, you probably have already lost some of those probiotic bacteria from their ""war"" with other bacteria, and the rest are getting flushed away. You'll lose some calories (it's not a lot) even if you are absorbing all the nutrients from your food in your small intestine. But there's no hard and fast number for this. By the way, there's no real hard and fast number for the calories you get from food, either. It's just convenient to pretend there is."	"If you are a short inactive woman, eating 2,000 calories a day will make you gain weight. If you are a tall inactive man, the same calories would make you lose weight. Calorie calculator - Mayo ClinicMost people do not want to simply lose weight, they want to keep the weight off. Unfortunately, this is a lot more complicated than counting calories. The long term benefits of dieting are not positive. I cover it in my post or keep reading: Eating Less? You May Not Lose Weight. Here's Why. The only thing that seems to consistently work long term for weight loss is bariatric surgery. ""A recent systematic review examining the efficacy of major commercial and organized self-help weight loss programs in the United States concluded that the evidence to support the use of such programs was suboptimal, except for one trial on Weight Watchers. Furthermore, the programs were associated with high costs, attrition rates, and probability of regaining at least 50% of the lost weight in 1 to 2 years...Bariatric surgery generally is effective for sustained weight loss of about 16% for people with BMIs of at least 40 kg/m(2) or at least 35 kg/m(2) with comorbid conditions"" Bariatric surgery: an evidence-based analysis. Even surgery is not enough to look like a magazine model (even with airbrushing). For those of us with a calculator, a five foot woman who weighs 200 pounds has a BMI high enough for surgery. That surgery will result in about 16% of her weight lost, or 32 pounds. She will still likely weigh 168 after having surgery done. For a 6 foot man, he'd need to weigh 300 pounds to qualify for surgery. After surgery, he'd get a 48 pound weight loss, and still weigh 252 pounds. (BTW, his resting caloric burning at 300 pounds was 3279 calories a day. So eating 2000 calories would be starving for him.) NutritionData BMI & Calories Burned CalculatorIn frustration, many people drop their caloric intake to below what they need to function minimally. In many parts of the world they have another word for this diet, it's called starvation. And starvation does work, but only short term. This Just In:  Starving Yourself Leads to Greater Weight Loss Than Just Dieting. As soon as you stop starving your body will rebound hard, storing more fat in preparation for what it can only assume is a crop shortage.Remember Rubenesque?The reality is that our bodies do not respond to calories. We respond to caloric trends with hormonal adaptions. Certain food and lifestyle choices set you up to succeed or fail calorically (and these goals change based on societal norms - remember the Rubenesque female?). Weight Gain: The Connection Between The Sugars You Eat and the Hormones You Produce. Starvation alters the levels of thyroid hormone dramatically long before your body starts depleting your fat stores. So the only way to change your body is very slowly and sustainably, with changes you can maintain for the rest of your life. Just when you thought you'd got a handle on hormones and weight loss, it turns out that when you give a germ free mouse a fecal transplant from an obese mouse, the germ free mouse will gain 57% more weight while eating the same calories. How Are We To Lose Weight If Diet And Exercise Are Not Enough?For simplicity's sake, at this point certain long term dietary choices can improve your microbiome and lead to more sustainable weight loss. With apologies to the Paleo crowd, the data we have at this early stage supports the Mediterranean lifestyle (not just diet, take up three hour slow dinners.) http://apjcn.nhri.org.tw/server/..."

what is the benefit of going walking every morning	bollywood industry does not  encourage outsiders for ex outsiders may get one or at max two chances whereas star kids get multiple chances to perform	0	Whether you are a morning person or not does not matter when your health is endangered. In order to prevent having health problems both in the young age and old, one needs to practice exercising (walk) in the morning.It is a tough routine, especially due to the fact that we have to do something immediately as we wake up. But once we get into the machine and we start our engines as soon as we wake up, we will start to notice positive consequences reflecting on our lives. Those consequences can have both long-term and short-term effects and here is the list of reasons (and consequences) why you should start exercising the next morning you wake up.10 REASONS WHY MORNING EXERCISES (WALK) ARE CRUCIALLY IMPORTANT FOR YOUR HEALTHYOUR METABOLISM WILL WORK FASTEROnce you start exercising in the morning you will notice one unusual thing about your body – your metabolism. Everyone has a different metabolism – there are people who have naturally slow metabolism and then, there are people who need to boost their metabolism. Therefore, there is not a better way to do the the boosting than to get up in the morning and exercise until you feel that you can start your day.EARLY EXERCISES WILL REDUCE STRESS AND DEPRESSIONScientists have proven that exercises make the body produce endorphin which raises the level of happiness. People who are constantly stressed out or even depressed will reduce significantly their „bad“ states by starting to exercise in the morning. It is important for them to be active as soon as they wake up because then, they will remain positive and relaxed for the rest of the day.YOU WILL GAIN THIS FEELING OF ACCOMPLISHMENT WHEN YOU FINISH YOUR EXERCISEThere are those days when nothing seems to go right and whatever you do does not feel like an accomplishment. However, once you start exercising in the morning, this will be all irrelevant due to the fact that doing a successful exercise morning session is the accomplishment itself. Your subconscious will feel like you achieved something great and you will feel better for the rest of the day.THIS HABIT MAY ATTRACT OTHER HEALTHY HABITSPeople say it takes a month of doing something every day in order for that to become a habit. Living a healthy lifestyle does not only mean exercising every morning but eating healthy as well. Therefore, once you make exercise a habit, you will start feeling so good that you will start thinking about other healthy things such as eating the right food in order to stay healthy.EXERCISING IN THE MORNING BURNS MORE FATThere are certain studies that show that when you exercise in the morning before you have your breakfast you are more likely to lose up to 20% more fat than usually. This is important because if you are striving towards looking good and being in good shape, you will achieve the desired results way faster. If you decided to exercise in the evening, the result simply would not be the same.YOUR ENERGY LEVELS IN THE MORNING WILL BE MUCH HIGHERHuman bodies are built that way to have much more energy to spend right after we wake up and it is solely due to the unhealthy lifestyle that we lead that make us feel drowsy and tired once we wake up. Therefore, once you start exercising and this becomes your routine you will start feeling energy pumping through your body. This means only one thing – that you will have more energy to spend on the exercise itself and make your workout harder and better.THE NATURAL GLOW OF YOUR SKIN WILL APPEARIt is scientifically proven that once you start working out it will have positive effects not only on your metabolism but on your skin as well. People who exercise in the morning are more likely to have a natural skin glow and appear healthier and more beautiful than those who do not work out at all or work out in the evening.YOU WILL BE MORE CONCENTRATED AFTER THE WORKOUTMorning exercise is the best way to become 100% concentrated through the whole day because it kind of works like a cup of coffee that lasts for more than 10 hours. This happens because we put our wake up our bodies and we become ready to tackle the work that we have to do during the day. Once you start exercising regularly in the morning you will notice a significant improve of performance on your job no matter what kind of job you really do.IT’S LESS LIKELY TO BE INTERRUPTEDHonestly, what are the odds of being called or interrupted by someone early in the morning when you prepare to exercise? Pretty minimal, I’d say. On the other hand, if you decide to exercise in the afternoon, there is a huge possibility of someone or something getting in your way – an urgent call from work, your parents visiting you or your girlfriend/boyfriend being suddenly in a desperate need of attention.IMPROVE YOUR SLEEP BY EXERCISING REGULARLYRegular exercise can certainly improve the quality of your sleep and sleep is a crucial part of your health. That’s why you need you will start sleeping always the same amount of hours because you will train your body to follow certain rhythm of sleeping on time and getting up on time to exercise. Furthermore, you will start waking up by yourself and full of energy because you will know that the best part of your day is in the morning.To sum up, it is difficult to start exercising in the morning but you need to be persistent and do it for at least a month before you actually start looking forward to it and before you can have some positive effects. But once you get used to it, the results will be more than amazing. All of the examples listed above will become true and you will generally feel better and you will be able to go out and seize the day.Source: Benefits of Morning Walk	We have all grown up watching Hindi Bollywood movies, idolizing movie stars and wishing to live their kind of lifestyle.

are there any martial artists who started later in life and went on to become champions	what are the pros and cons of bringing a small claims case before the people  court on tv	0	This question is repeated under karate, Taekwondo and jujitsu and the answer is the same.First of all, you can start a martial art at almost any age and become quite accomplished at it. Age isn't the overriding issue. The issue is understanding what is taught and being able to apply that knowledge. One who reaches black belt at age 50 will have a better understanding than a 9 year old.The question is: What is a “champion?” The word is so over used it becomes meaningless. Understand first, this is not a takeoff on Taekwondo but the issue comes up more because of the prevalence of Taekwondo.It is common that when talking with some one about the martial arts that they know someone who is a national champion in Taekwondo. The instructor in the next town was the “All Korean Champion.” He was the second or third one to hit this particular school. So, they're a “Champion?” Are we talking local, state, national or world champion?A Kyokushin system I know of had it’s “Nationals” each year. Three schools participated. Was the winner a national champion?A well known Taekwondo system required participation and placement in a given number of tournaments before it awarded the title of “All State Champion.”Olympic level Taekwondo or Judo champions I understand. They have a gold medal to prove it. The rest are a mater of semantics. All you have to do is pick the right school. Then, you could become a champion.Seiyo Shorin-ryu Karate & Kobudo - Leach HanshiRon Leach Karate | Facebook	The pros… everyone gets paid to some extent, even if one party loses. (my understanding and correct me if I am wrong if anyone has better information) is that the appearance fee can sometimes be bigger then the damages sought.A Pro and Con: You are on national television. People will recognize you. all parties will have 15 minutes of fame. The People’s Courts main goal is to make good TV, which could result in some embarrassing moments. If it goes the wrong way, eventually your episode will be forgotten and it could be a funny story to tell at dinner parties.The Con: Not sure how it is in your state, but in New York there is somewhat of a “black list” for renters who have sued their landlords. Even if the landlord is in the wrong and you are in the right. I would check to see if this goes on a permanent record. If a landlord recognizes you in the future from a place your trying to rent, it could backfire.Ultimately go with your gut. The court process is fascinating to go through if you haven’t been through it before. Being on the set of a TV show is also fascinating. I have done some pretty questionable TV in the past (Jerry Springer, and a show on FUSE called “You Rock Let’s Roll”.) Both TV spots were SO embarrassing, but most people were just fascinated with the fact that I got on TV.Life is short. If you do it, please update us so we can watch your episode!

how do i know if the girl am dating online truly live me for real	how do i know if my online girlfriend truly loves me	1	She is probably about to ask you to pay for her new wifi connection or something.

It happens to the best of us. Don’t get down on yourself about it. It happened to The San Diego Chargers middle linebacker and it was his friend playing a joke on him.

what area of games programming is most mathematically involved and suited to a math major	if one was to go about learning python to be able to apply it to his area of study major in chem minor in math what applications of python could be most useful when applying for a job	0	I only have a small familiarity with games programming specifically, but based on my experience in general programming I have a pretty good guess. I’m guessing you’re asking because you know that especially these days a LOT of the work is on the creative and visual end. And much of the general programming is not especially mathematical in nature.Visuals/graphic design : little mathematicsAs you might guess this is much more of an artistic exercise and even the implementation of models is not especially mathematical in nature. Caveat: any game where the movement is guided by a physics engine completely throws this assertion out the window. That is highly mathematical, although for that work you’d be better served specifically by a physics degree than a math degree.Core code (structures, servers, execution environments, etc) : somewhat mathematicalThis is the broader code which is more general purpose and follows many of the same design patterns in gaming projects as well as non-gaming projects. I’ve found that there is a certain applicability of mathematical thought processes to code design. Especially to the way mathematicians think about proofs. Repeatability, the knowledge to use others’ previous results, and absolute precision are equally important to programming and writing proofs. However, this is almost a metaphorical link; the thought processes are similar but they’re still distinct skills.AI : intensely mathematicalFor my money, this is probably where a pure math background would be welcome on a software team even with no programming experience. Obviously, both skills are necessary to produce a finished product but designing an intelligent system for a given game is hard. Like really hard and furthermore the more unique the game is the more poorly applying established algorithms to it would work and the drop off for this is very sharp. For genres, think real-time strategy (e.g. Starcraft, Supreme Commander), turn-based strategy (Final Fantasy), turn-based tactics (Final Fantasy Tactics, Fire Emblem, XCom), card-based strategy (Hearthstone, Duels of the Planeswalkers) on the high end of abstraction and strategy. All of these absolutely depend on an AI smart enough to at least somewhat challenge a human player (for non pvp aspects). This is incredibly difficult. Of course there’s plenty of games with basic enemy AI, any rpg (online or not) or shooter for example. These are often (in my experience) much more constrained in terms of intelligence, so while still somewhat challenging, they would not be nearly as deep as my first examples.	(Read my edits !!!!!)I’m probably going to offend some people but oh well, here goes.In 2017, the only ways to “guarantee” a comfy and stable income are obtaining and doing well in a STEM degree, Law, and some business degrees like Finance, Marketing, Economics, and Accounting. The worthless ones you are curious about? Pretty much everything else. You can without a doubt struggle to find work related to your degree, but in the world we live in there is a strong preference for certain fields such as the ones above.I’m sorry, but if you major in Philosophy or Art History and don’t have a path to wind up in one of these in-demand fields, I wish you the best of luck to you in life because nobody in industry seems to be wanting the talents that the students in these types of majors present. I would love to be shown otherwise, I really would, but in the age of “Big Data” people just seem to care about getting the data, interpreting it, and seeing how it will impact business decisions and some legal matters probably too. Yes, without question communication skills and critical thinking skills are important but all of these are very developed in somebody that did well in STEM, business, or law. Every humanities degree will claim they promote “critical thinking” but outside of their respective domain, these people as a collective whole seem to lack more universal critical thinking. If you want to develop your critical thinking and be able to apply it to everything, not just your restrictive domain, study Mathematics/Statistics or Computer Science/EE where the literal study of logic is a core part of the curriculum (Law could be another good one here). The lab sciences and other engineering degrees are also good at developing this, but logic isn’t as heavily focused on since it isn’t as essential (in one sense) to the field than it is for the ones like Math/Stats or CS/EE since these fields actively deal with logical arguments (it is quite literally a foundational aspect of the work they do).Engineering degrees still hold promise though additional schooling seems to be becoming increasingly necessary from talking to some of my engineering peers. However I believe this is not just restricted to engineering. Other STEM fields like Biology, Chemistry, Mathematics, Physics, etc. also require additional schooling in order to secure a comfortable salary and good job security. Nevertheless engineering degrees are still valuable and can lead to some good, stable careers and obviously medicine (if you can make it to med school or dental school and not drop out) promises a good career assuming you’re not a really shitty doctor. Additionally there are options in physical/occupational therapy and nursing, but it does appear that these fields are becoming more and more competitive to enter as there are more and more people applying for these jobs, so beware of this trend.The common theme among these majors that provide the best job outlook is because the knowledge and experience gained in their undergraduate (or master’s) years is in demand and directly provides the necessary and high-demand talent employers in these industries need. You can argue this is the case for all majors but if you have an undergraduate degree in Theater, your talents aren’t competitive for the high-paying jobs people in these other areas have access to and the field is very competitive.For the sake of the argument, let’s examine the field of Data Science. In recent years, this is the new hot buzz word for a career. Basically this is the role of a mathematician or statistician in an industry setting though there is research being done in ivory towers in this area as well. Let’s say you are looking to hire somebody for a new data science role and you have two applicants, A and B. Applicant A studied math at the undergraduate and masters level and has a concentration in Statis...
what are the differences between larceny and robbery	what is the difference between the words burglary and robbery	0	Broadly speaking, larceny is non-violent theft and robbery is violent theft. That used to be the fairly standard way of looking at the two until recent times (20th century). Today, the criminal offence of larceny is removed from most countries' laws in favour of a general theft statute, whilst retaining robbery as theft with violence.	"Just a hint: Google is a wonderful thing. Just Google burglary robbery and you get What's the Difference Between Burglary, Robbery, and Theft? What's the Difference Between Burglary, Robbery, and Theft?By Daniel Taylor, Esq. on January 5, 2015 9:39 AM  Although burglary, robbery, and theft are often used interchangeably, there are distinct differences between the three.What the three have in common, of course, is that they all may involve the unauthorized taking of someone's personal property by another person (aka stealing). But beyond this shared link, burglary, robbery, and theft are all different crimes.What are the differences between the three?Theft/LarcenyTheft is the most basic of the three crimes. A theft occurs any time there in an unauthorized taking of property from another with the intent to permanently deprive that person of the property.In most states, the common law crime of larceny has been merged into a general ""theft"" crime. But in some states, larceny may be considered its own criminal offense, occurring when a person unlawfully takes and carries away another person's personal property without consent and with the intent to permanently deprive the owner.Robbery So if stealing something is theft, then what is robbery? Robbery is essentially theft accomplished through the use of physical force or fear.For example, someone stealing your purse after you set it down on a table and walked away would be theft. But someone stealing your purse by demanding you hand it over in a threatening way or by violently snatching it away from you would be robbery.BurglaryThe crime of burglary, though most often equated with theft, doesn't actually require that a theft occur, or even be intended. Burglary is simply the unlawful entry into a structure, such as a home or business, with the intent to commit a crime inside. Although many burglaries involve theft, the crime intended can be any crime from theft, to murder, to making pot brownies.A person can be charged with burglary regardless of whether the crime intended was actually committed. Additionally, the unlawful entry into the structure need not be accomplished by breaking and entering (although that is often the case). Rather, the entry merely must merely be unlawful, such as trespass through an unlocked door."
is graph theory counted as a prerequisite for machine learning	is graph theory a nicetohave course to have for machine learning	0	Jason here,So, you technically do not need graph theory in order to involve yourself in machine learning, but it is very helpful to know. While whatever machine is learning, graph theory can be helpful in ways of organization for both the machine and yourself. Now, typically, yes, it would be required, but you don’t necessarily need it for everything, you could still preform basic functions without it. Overall, I would suggest that if you plan to participate in things like machine language, algorithm, that you try to at least understand graph theory.	I've done both, and unless your Machine Learning course involves Probabilistic Graphical Models, I'd say No. Even for Probabilistic Graphical Models, you'd probably do Bayesian Networks, which can be studied without extensive knowledge of Graph Theoretic concepts. The 2 can be phenomenally unrelated.A standard course in Graph Theory would define a Graph mathematically, and move on to enumerate a few properties of relationships between Edges & Vertices, the structures of Graphs and their properties, and Algorithms.Machine Learning relies heavily on Statistics, Linear Algebra and Computational Learning Theory. The latter is not stressed on too much in an Undergraduate course. Classification, Regression and Kernels can form a bulk of the Vector Space model stuff, and then you move on to Probabilistic Models. Personally, I was not very thrilled with the level of formalization, or Mathematical depth in Machine Learning, which is why I lost interest in it at some point down the lane. Graph Theory, on the other hand, is a very abstract and well developed subject (Algebraic Graph Theory, Topological Graph Theory, Extremal Graph Theory). To make contributions there would require substantial abstraction skills & creativity, good Proof-Writing skills and a fairly deep knowledge of some pretty fundamental Math. It's easier to make contributions in Machine Learning as its new, still developing and fairly naive (atleast Mathematically) in some sense. However, it all comes down to interest. Take both courses, and treat them to be independent of each other so that you can gauge your interest and skill in both. They're both good to have. See what you like and move on from there. For now, however, these 2 fields don't have too much in common.If you have to choose one, then I'd say a more Mathematically rigorous and abstract person may enjoy Graph Theory as a first step into a large world of deeper concepts and linkage with fields like Topology and Combinatorics (and Algorithms). A more experimental, hands-on and hungry-to-try-things person might enjoy Machine Learning a tad more.Hope this helps!
what are the best schools to study natural language processing in india	which are the best schools for studying natural language processing	0	In my experience, I found Celoxis to be relatively easy to use and implement in the workplace.It is a complete project management platform so that you don't have to jump through...	According to Google Scholar metrics 2014, some of the top journals/conferences in Computational Linguistics/Natural Language Processing are:Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL)Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing (EMNLP)North American Chapter of the Association for Computational LinguisticsInternational Conference on Computational Linguistics (COLING)Conference of the European Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics (EACL)While making individual effort for selecting the right graduate school in NLP, I did a small experiment:I extracted all publication links from Google Scholar categorized under these top journals/conferences which pointed to an ACM Digital Library link, then scanned the publication summary to retrieve the authors and their universities. Here's the rundown:There were 222 different publications and the contributing authors hailed from ~150 different universities worldwide.Total contributor count for an university is the total number of authors (including repitition) from a particular university whose name turned up in at least one of the publications.Total publication count for an university is the total number of publications that had an author from that university.The universities mentioned comprised ~64% of all publications. Google, Microsoft, Yahoo and IBM had a major contribution as well but I excluded them from this list.Important note: The experiment includes only articles having citation count >= the h5-index of the particular journal in which it was published according to Google Scholar.
will ted cruz supporters vote for donald trump	will donald trump support ted cruz for president	0	These are the days that try men’s souls, particularly Republican souls.A two-party democracy necessarily implies that each party is a coalition of somewhat disparate groups. The Republican party coalition grew somewhat under Nixon, and a lot more under Reagan, with the addition of Reagan Democrats. These were traditionally Democratic voters who were or felt disrespected and unheard by the Democratic political class, and left behind by the economy.Donald Trump has become a political phenomenon by energizing the 2016 equivalent of that component of the electorate. But he’s done it without considering how to bond this group to the rest of the GOP coalition.His allegiance to GOP platform positions and cultural norms is, at best paper thin and at worst a polite lie. Virtually no one who’s in the GOP coalition because they care about faith, or abortion, or family values, or the 2nd amendment, or deregulation, or taxes, or small government, or the deficit, believes that Donald Trump actually cares about any of these things; they’ve got plenty of evidence that he doesn’t. Nevertheless, they’re hoping that he’ll come down on their side of these issues because he’s making a few of the right noises, or because he’ll appoint conservatives, or just because they’re certain Hillary Clinton will come down on the other side, and they’ve at least got some chance with Trump.Trump, meanwhile is making it hard for them by doing his best to lead his army of the disaffected and assuming the rest of the GOP will have no choice but to join him, and by energizing his army in ways that many of them find troublesome or worse.Meanwhile, in a parallel universe, Ted Cruz is a key leader of a movement of the existing GOP coalition to the right. He’s also interested in remaking the party, but in a totally different way; by shifting the whole coalition while keeping it together. The Cruz movement has been extraordinarily successful at local and state levels, and pretty successful at the congressional level; a Cruz nomination would have been a big milestone for the Tea Party approach, instead, it was sideswiped and rendered temporarily irrelevant by Trump’s march of the disaffected.Big tent parties are used to jostling among the coalition members. The Tea Party, “Movement Conservatives,” Neocons, Acela Republicans, and others all have their ups and downs and internecine warfare. But this internal conflict is different. It’s the first one I know of where the differences are sharp enough, and the leaders, particularly Trump, have so little forbearance, that it’s become a completely open conflict.Whether or not Trump wins the Tea Party Republicans will have a lot of rebuilding to do. If he does win, they’ll have a harder and longer road. So I think if they don’t play the long game and let Trump loose, they’ll find themselves playing an even longer game.As a Democrat, I think it’s a big mistake to look on all this with schadenfreude. Not just because of the bromides about how we need two strong parties to keep democracy healthy, but because Trump (and Sanders too) have proved the existence, by tapping into, so much political voltage. Who are these people? Have we, as parties, really failed them? To what extent are their concerns legitimate? To what extent can government do anything about them?It’s entirely plausible to imagine Donald Trump having run as a Democrat. He would have had a harder time in the Dem primaries, but not a much harder time, and he could possibly have become the nominee. I’m very glad that I’m not the subject of the Republican schadenfreude that would have come with that.	I don't think his ego would allow him to support anyone but himself. He's not an ideological Republican, he's some kind of nihilist / narcissist / solipsist.If he loses out to one of the other candidates I expect we'll see him sniping from the sidelines and talking about how much better a job he would be doing. If the Republicans then lose the election… oh boy, he won't shut up about how he would have won until his dying day.
what is a gdp	what is the significance of gdp	1	Gross domestic product (GDP) is a monetary measure of the market value of all the final goods and services produced in a period of time, often annually or quarterly. Nominal GDPestimates are commonly used to determine the economic performance of a whole country or region, and to make international comparisons.	Hello,GDP Per Capita can be thought of as the average salary/income a person makes in a country. If every individual in a nation earns $1000 per year, then the nation's GDP per capita will be close to $1000.This indicator is significant because incomes are the primary decider of whether someone is poor or not. If a person enjoys higher incomes he/she would be able to be more healthy, educate their kids better, live in nice, secure homes and in general be more happy. Every nation wants that and thus GDP has become the fundamental measurement of the economy.
is there a blind trust provision for american presidents and how is it enforced	who will be the new american president why	0	The question is larger than that. Others have more or less answered the specific one asked, but even those answers are not completely correct.This stems from concerns about conflict of interest. Federal law makes it illegal for public officials in the executive branch to personally and substantially participate in matters (governmental matters where they have authority or influence) in which they (or their immediate families, business partners or associated organizations) hold financial interests. However, Congress has recognized that this is not feasible for the President, so Congress has exempted the President. This is important because, historically, it means that Congress has long understood, and accepted the fact that Presidents will have assets.In addition, while Federal ethics law generally prohibits officers and employees from personally and substantially participating in matters in which they have a financial interest, there is a disqualification requirement that allows them to recuse themselves. That means they are not required, nor expected to divest their assets or use any other means to shield them from those financial assets. What’s more, those subject to the disqualification requirement is defined to exclude the President and Vice President. So not only are they not required to divest assets, or use a blind trust to remove themselves from participating in their active control, they are also not required to recuse themselves in potential conflicts. They can, but they are not required to.So, there is no current legal or constitutional requirement that would compel the President to relinquish financial interests because of a conflict of interest.Some have done so. Most notably some of the more recent Presidents. But most, however, have not. We think that because we, in our lifetimes, have become used to certain political practices like releasing tax returns, divesting assets, using blind trusts, etc, this is some sort of requirement or it has always been this way. Neither of those is true. Obama, for example did not divest his assets or use a blind trust. In fact, he criticised Romey’s promise to do so on the grounds that a “blind trust isn’t really blind”.The rationale for doing so is purely political. Short of completely selling of one’s assets and burying the proceeds in backyard, one cannot escape the conflict of interest. Non cash assets are “live” the increase and decrease in value based on market forces. The President, and the executive branch have considerable control over the management levers of the economy that a conflict of interest is never avoided.Furthermore, While a lot has been made of the recents President's use of blind trusts, Both the President, and his trustees know full well what those investment are. Even in a qualified blind trust where the investor is not supposed to know what investments are in it, they don’t magically take all existing holdings and convert them into something completely different. Just because a trusted confidant is managing them temporarily does not mean the President has completely forgotten what his or her holdings are. This is merely a vehicle That gives the appearance of having avoided potential corruption. That, of course, I admit is merely a personal observation.It is a generally accepted practice that conflicts of interest do not need to be resolved by divesting or instituting a blind trust anywhere except in the most extreme cases. The principal, most used, and an effective way to deal with a conflict of interest is disclosure. You make public what your interest are so that everyone can evaluate your actions in that light. In fact, using a blind trust may actually be a forensic countermeasure because it lulls everyone into thinking you have eliminated the potential corruption, and they stop watching.	I used to be a proud Texas Republican. Four years ago I moved to Germany with the energy industry. After living in Germany for three years, I came to know first-hand the incredible advantages of living in a social-democratic country. I got to see up close how a universal healthcare system works under capitalism -- it's magnificent. I got to see how free university education works under capitalism -- it's terrific. I got to see lots of the programs that Bernie Sanders has been fighting for his entire career, and I saw them work under capitalism.I'm now a Bernie Sanders supporter. I believe he is the best chance we have.
how do i make a girl who is a newly joined junior in my college to fall in love with me	what do you have to do to become an airline pilot	0	A2A.The answer is well covered by Mukul Latiyan, however adding to what has been mentioned,You will not be spending a lot of time with her as you both don't fall under the same class room. So, first things first. Don't try to hit on her right from the very first instance itself.Look at her in the eye when speaking to her and be bold. Don't sound desperate when speaking to her. It's a big turn off for girls. Look at her in the eye and speak occasionally. But not very frequently. Bump into her a few times, say Hi, offer help with studies and getting notes and text from seniors.Try to get her phone number now and initially the first week, approach with hesitation and leave texts like good mornings and nights. After the first week approach slowly and work your way up in trying to woo her.All the best..!!	It might be better to ask why you want to become an airline pilot.Then you can start to pursue the necessary steps to get there.Some join the military.Others the civilian route. Both have their advantages and disadvantages.You don't necessarily need college but it helps, a lot. I strongly recommend a 4 year degree. What you will need is flight time. If you are not going to go the military route then you need to get to an airport with a flight school and ask questions.  Lots of them. You also better start saving money as it's very expensive. The best way is to get your flying time the cheapest way you can. 
what are the home remedies for piles or anal fissure	how do i cure anal fissure permanently with home remedies	1	Tear or wear in anal opening below the dentate line is fissures. One of the most painful anal disorders that is caused by intense pressure of hard stools, diarrhea, pregnancy or child birth and sometimes caused by trauma. Sometimes it can be a worse conditions than piles and hemorrhoids too.Constipation and passing of hard stools is a result of regular indigestion and acidity. So to cure fissures permanently, you need to treat these causes first otherwise fissure will comeback everytime you treat it. However, we have divided fissures treatment in four stages so that it can be cured permanently and you would get a fissures free life.For the detailed Note on How To Cure Fissures Permanently , for a Fissures free life you can visit the original article here.First Stage TreatmentThis is the instant treatment for the pain and itching associated with it. You need to take some medicine for fissures, like ointments and painkillers fo instant effect. Fissures ointments like GNT (Glycerine Tri Nitrate) ointment have magical effect on fissures.It will heal fissures and will alleviate the burns and itching symptoms. However there are some side effects like dizziness, nausea and minor headaches. So it is recommended to use a pea size amount of the ointment only.For pain, you can use a normol dose of paracetamol or ibuferene.Second Stage TreatmentThe second stage treament involves lowering of pressure on anal opening. This can be done by taking stool softeners and drinking lot of water. Once you will have softer bowel movement, you will see that your constipation has gone and fissures will be cured eventually. Take medicines for diarrhea to lower the harsh effect on anal lining. Avoid anal sex, because that will make the condition even worse.Third Stage TreatmentThird Stage fissures treatment involves treating your indigestion and digestive problems, that had actually caused syptoms of constipation and hard stools. Acidity is one of major reason of indigestion, that irritates stomaches and intestines. You should take antacids to nutrilize the effect of acidity and hear burns.Final Stage TreatmentThe final stage treatment is nothing other than changing your lifestyle. Nurture healthy habits and follow healthy diet full of high fiber foods and avoid unhealthy habits and diet, that's all you have to do for the permanent cure. Avoid sedently lifestyle and excessive sitting and biking to avoid fissures. Similarly avoid junk foods and spicy foods, because these foods triggers fissures irritation and itching. Include yoga like breathing exercises ( Kapalbhatti) and shoulder stand ( Sarvangasana) to counter the effects of fissure and to lower the pressure in anal area.

how many words are actually needed to learn for the gre and what is the correct method to prepare for the gre verbal 	how can i get best score in gre	0	Let me tackle the second part of your question first:What is the correct method to prepare for the GRE verbal?Be careful assuming that the “correct” (maybe I’ll use “best” or “preferred” since there are plenty of good variations of study plans) way to prepare includes the sheer memorization of hundreds of obscure vocabulary words.  On each of the two verbal sections that “count” (you’ll also get a section that’s for research purposes and doesn't count, and that might be verbal or it might be math), you’ll see 10 “vocabulary” questions (typically 6 Text Completion and 4 Sentence Equivalence).  Figure on average you’ll see about six answer choices per problem, meaning that overall on test day you’ll see 120 answer choices that fit “vocabulary.”But go through official practice problems and you should see that most of those words are fairly common, some answer choices (for the multi-blank Text Completions) are phrases and not just vocab words, and of the “not everyone is going to know this word” words, many appear as a single answer choice among other choices that are common words.  Meaning: if one of the words you do know is right, then the one you don’t is wrong, and if the words you do know are all wrong, then this bizarre word is right by process of elimination.So memorizing 1,000 individual words is a long, circuitous route to honing in on the handful of times that you might need to make a decision between two or more “hard” vocab words.Then add these elements:Unless the word came directly from a modern ETS-written GRE problem, it’s just a hard vocabulary word that someone who doesn’t write for the GRE thinks might be a word on the test.  Which also means that it probably comes from an old test, either the old (pre-2011) GRE, which had much more of an emphasis on obscure vocabulary, or the old (pre-2016) SAT, which also emphasized uncommon words.  So most words you memorize won’t appear on your test, and some have a very low (if nonzero at all) probability of showing up there.The modern GRE doesn’t directly test pure word meaning: it’s all about how the word fits into the context of the sentence.  And a good deal of vocab memorization comes out of context, memorizing a dictionary or flashcard definition without really becoming familiar with how that word is used in various situations.And what it really boils down to is this:  remember those commercials for kid cereals (Lucky Charms, Count Chocula, Froot Loops…) that said “part of a healthy, well-balanced breakfast” but then also had a quick shot of all the food you probably should have been eating instead (a banana, maybe some eggs, some fresh fruit…)?  Memorizing some vocabulary is “part of a well-balanced study plan” but it’s not the most important or most valuable part.  You have to know some vocabulary, but your primary score gains will come from learning how to do the problems and reason your way through them.So with all that said, here are some core elements of a quality GRE Verbal study plan:Devour the official ETS-written problems.For one, only ETS really knows which words it will test and which ones it won’t, and any other resource is only making an educated guess.  So make sure you prioritize the official GRE study books, and the official ETS PowerPrep practice tests.  If the authors of the GRE have put it in their resources, it’s a word worth getting to know.But that’s not all!  As you go through the official questions, you’ll get a good feel for how they’re written (I’ll touch on that more a little further down) and what types of action items you’ll need to attack the questions.  This is really important - there’s a definite style and feel to the official problems, and the more you’re in sync with that style the better your study tactics will be directed right at the target.2. Find vocabulary words in context.One huge problem with just sheer flashcard memorization is that you’ll learn some combination of a formal definition and one single usage of that word.  But you’re not directly tested on the meaning of the word: you’re tested on its usage.  So with any word, Google it and then click on “News” and read it as it’s used in a handful of articles.3. Learn words in families.Again, think about how you’ll be tested on these words.  In Sentence Equivalence, your job is to find two words that give the sentence the same, logical meaning.  So learning multiple words that mean the same or similar things (loquacious and garrulous both mean “talkative” or “wordy,” the opposite of succinct) sets you up for questions in which you’ll often need to find pairs.  And with Text Completion, often you’ll see that the sentence requires agreement between two blanks or between one blank and a given word; in these cases, it’s also helpful to know “these words tend to go together.”  So for any “new” word, find a few related, similar words that you already know and think about them together.  And if multiple new words have similar meanings, try to learn them together also.4. Pay attention to roots.Learning words one at a time is pretty inefficient.  So similar to grouping them in families above, picking up on roots that give words similar meanings can help you get more mileage out of each thing you memorize.  Knowing that “mal” is a prefix for “bad” means that even if you don’t know the exact meaning of “malicious” or “malevolent” or “malignant,” you have a pretty good sense that they’re words that mean “bad.”  So if the meaning of the blank has to be “good” you can eliminate those words, and if it’s something negative then unless you see a better fit that you know for sure, you can feel confident picking one of the mal- words.  This website was one of my favorite resources as I was writing up our section on roots in the Veritas Prep lesson book: English Language RootsNow, those are great strategies for learning vocabulary in a GRE-efficient way, but keep in mind that Text Completion and Sentence Equivalence are not explicitly vocabulary exercises!  So as you study, you should also:5. Pay attention to subtle differences between word meanings.This is something that GRE students don’t do nearly enough!  Lots of questions are designed to hinge not on the definition of an obscure word that you’d never use yourself, but on the very precise meanings of words that you use frequently.  I love the problem in this video, for which the whole thing comes down to the difference between “massive” (very big) and “excessive” (too big).  To the untrained or slightly-unfocused (or focused on the wrong thing) they both mean the exact same thing related to “big.”  But the GRE does a great job of requiring (or ruling out) specific meanings and punishing those who take a meaning that’s really close but not exact.6. Think about the second, third, fourth, etc. definitions of a word, not just the most obvious one.Another theme that gets people down is that they quickly make decisions on words based on one definition, without considering some of the lesser-used definitions of those words (cue Led Zeppelin “there’s a sign on the door but she wants to be sure, for you know sometimes words have two meanings…”).  There’s one in an official practice test where just about everyone rules out the word “plastic” - you need a word that means flexible/pliable/malleable - because we all think of plastic material, but then you go through the other answer choices and…maybe one word you’re not exactly sure of but the others don’t really work.  And it’s so, so common…about half of people I see pick the word they don’t know (“well, it isn’t these so it must be that”) and the other half go through a second pass and essentially say “I’d use a different word myself, but yeah I guess plastic does fit here…”One of our instructors called me a couple weeks ago after scoring a perfect 170/170 and as we were debriefing his test, he specifically highlighted that exact takeaway.  He said that much of the test was very comfortable, but on each verbal section at least two problems came down to him having to really dig deep on “wait…but that word that I was about to eliminate actually has several other meanings.” And he specifically called out a strategy we talk about with regard to that “plastic” problem - before you eliminate a word, see if you can change the part of speech.  “Plastic” as an adjective may mean fake, or cheap, or something pertaining to the material plastic.  But “plasticity” as a noun absolutely conjures up the meaning “flexibility/pliability” and helps you realize that “plastic,” via a definition lower on the hierarchy in the dictionary, gives you what you need.7. Be ready to work on these problems.One last limitation to the centrality of vocab memorization is that anything you expressly memorize for conjures up the idea of “hey you either know the meaning or you don’t.”  But so many GRE verbal problems are a lot more about trial and error, plugging in an answer choice or two and seeing if they work together, then going back and trying another combination, and really asking yourself deep down “would anyone really write that sentence?”  Here’s one more video that deals with that topic - any of the problems for which there are multiple answers (Text Completion with more than one blank; Sentence Equivalence where you have to choose two answers) aren’t just an exercise in picking one answer, then moving on and picking the next.  You may find one meaning you love but then have to really critically consider whether you can match it with the other blank or another choice.  And the danger comes from then forcing a square peg in a round hole, so to speak, on that next decision.  GRE Verbal now more than ever really rewards critical thinking - the meaning of the sentence is so crucial but people spend too much of their time memorizing meanings of words.  And as you practice with official problems, you’ll start to learn that lesson and hopefully better focus your preparation on these strategies that will help you master the questions, whether you’ve memorized 1,000 words or even just 100.	First of all, I’m guessing by a high score you mean 330 - 340. Do not at all get afraid by all the propaganda that it is something extremely tough to achieve. It is not.I am not someone extraordinary. I failed countless, meaningless exams in my life. I have never been a topper or even close to that. So trust me, when I say, it is an extremely achievable target.Like any successful recipe, this also begins with some ingredients:Magoosh GRE Material (Verbal and Quants)Manhattan 5 lb. bookManhattan Mock Test Series (A set of 6 mock tests)Magoosh Flashcards (Available for free)Official ETS MaterialConfidence that you can do itGive yourself 2 - 3 months for preparation. Prepare a timeline.First things first, complete the Magoosh GRE Material videos. Both Verbal and Quants. They will take you quite some time. But they will be more than helpful in jogging old memories and clearing out the rust on those 10th standard mathematics that are already there but have been dormant being unused.Understand more importantly the process they are following to solve. Mathematics will follow straightforward logic, whereas Verbal might seem a little illogical at first, but really it is not. For Verbal it is VERY important to know the EXACT meaning of the words (Where constant practice from Magoosh Flashcards will help you) and also the structure and overall meaning of the sentence provided. Once you start getting the hang of it, you will start to understand the meaning and tone of the sentence, both in Reading Comprehension passages and Text Completions.Next, you MUST complete the ETS Official Guides, all 3 of them. There will be 2 mock tests provided in the book. Make sure you complete them and try to bring a score of +/- 2 from your target score. For example, for me the target score was 330, so I targeted for 328 - 332 in the ETS mocks.Next, the Manhattan 5 lb. book will be immensely helpful. Practice as much as you can each day. Doing BOTH Quants and Verbal. Complete the book by doing each and every problem and going through the answers that you did wrong or had confusion in. Also, make timelines (I did every alternate day) and give the 6 mocks one by one from Manhattan during this period. These mocks are a lot harder than actual GRE, so if you are scoring 318 - 322, expect a high score in GRE.Last but not the least, read, understand and memorize the words from Magoosh Flashcards. They will come extremely handy when you’re doing RC or TC.In the end, believe in yourself. Practice a lot and be confident of your ability. Most importantly, drink a lot of fluids! (Not just before the exam though - your washroom time is counted as the exam time except for breaks)Have a blast with the exam! All the best!
is the soul immortal	why is the soul immortal	1	Yes and free from religious dogma.? A soul is a spark of conscious energy. There are many varying sizes of souls. There is a soul in your body, the soul of the Sun, the soul of the planets, and well..., everything has soul. Soul is the reason things in the universe started coalescing into life. Soul is the reason nature follows the PHI ratio. If you have ever researched the sound of sacred geometry, you realize wave propagation is what causes life to exist. A sound or a word, but I like to call it frequency. There is clearly intelligent organization to the universe. Who are we to say what is alive, and what is not? What is conscious, and what is not.  When we look at the universe, we see electromagnetic fields everywhere. These electromagnetic fields contain the frequency and information to make life happen. Did you ever wonder why snowflakes all have different patterns, but they're all in a five sided shape? The universe is electromagnetic field within electromagnetic field. There is an electromagnetic field inside the human body that can be detected 10 feet outside the body during the emotion love. We have always thought the heavenly bodies produced the electromagnetic field. I think it is the electromagnetic field that's sweep matter into what we know as reality. Did you know every electromagnetic field takes the shape of a Torah. These fields  spiral out in both directions, from a center, or source. The bigger the electromagnetic field, the more information contained within. It is absolutely impossible for life to randomly come about. There is a sound, that causes everything, form spiral snail shells, to the Fibonacci pattern that spirals out of flowers when they bloom. Scientist have a hard time describing what exactly a field is. When you look at the universe and nature, you see this pattern in everything. The planet hold our magnetic field in, we call it gravity. The Sun holds all the planets in place. The Galaxy hold the Sun in place. The universe holds the galaxy in place, and I have no doubt the universe takes the same torroidial shape. The universe is probably held in place, by what scientists call, the multiverse. This field is present in life. These fields are present in planets. These fields are present in stars. These fields are present in galaxies. It is not a human body, it is a biomechanical quantum supercomputer. The bigger the field, the more information contained within. Field, held within field, infinitely. They can't get a solar system to form  in computer simulations, with gravity the only acting force. Furthermore how did everything haphazardly collide during the early formation of the solar system, with gravity as the only active force, and everything luckily settles on equator line of the Sun. That don't even make sense. There is the force of the wave. The wave is emitted from the field. The people who are sure souls don't exist, are the same people that said, you will never get a heavier than air craft off the ground. What causes the proteins and molecules to arrange in certain patterns, the wave. What causes snowflakes to freeze in a five-sided beautiful geometric pattern, the wave. What they teach us in school, is not the truth. If you want a better understanding, YouTube the sound of sacred geometry. If you want to know why snowflakes take the five Side pattern every time they fall . YouTube The Flower of Life. I was a smug atheist until an episode of the universe was showing solar system formation. They were describing planet hitting planet. Then everything ,  as if by miracle , or grace of God , just settles on the ecliptic plane of our star. Really? If gravity is the only acting force as we were taught in school, shouldn't we all hazardly orbit the Sun? That's an explanation, by our scientists, not a very realistic one. Some people when offered the easiest explanation,  just go with it, No research. As long as the person telling has some kind of indoctrinated teaching, most people accept it. If you think of space as a calm pool of water. Then think of the Sun as a giant pebble, dropped into that calm water. The waves would be tight at the epicenter, then get wider and wider the further they got from the source of the wave. Look at the size of the planets in our solar system. They are really small close to the Sun, As the wave gets wider more, and more, debri migrates to the lower part of the wave. That is why the planet sizes are small close to the Sun, and the further you get out, the bigger the planets get. Of course this could all be a coincidence, but at least I am NOT accepting the easiest answer given, or dening truth's, in defence my own way of thinking. It isn't science vs religion. It is simply divide and conquer. It makes it easier to control us. It is called common sense, because we look at the commonalities, and try to make sense of them.	Yes and free from religious dogma.? A soul is a spark of conscious energy. There are many varying sizes of souls. There is a soul in your body, the soul of the Sun, the soul of the planets, and well..., everything has soul. Soul is the reason things in the universe started coalescing into life. Soul is the reason nature follows the PHI ratio. If you have ever researched the sound of sacred geometry, you realize wave propagation is what causes life to exist. A sound or a word, but I like to call it frequency. There is clearly intelligent organization to the universe. Who are we to say what is alive, and what is not? What is conscious, and what is not.  When we look at the universe, we see electromagnetic fields everywhere. These electromagnetic fields contain the frequency and information to make life happen. Did you ever wonder why snowflakes all have different patterns, but they're all in a five sided shape? The universe is electromagnetic field within electromagnetic field. There is an electromagnetic field inside the human body that can be detected 10 feet outside the body during the emotion love. We have always thought the heavenly bodies produced the electromagnetic field. I think it is the electromagnetic field that's sweep matter into what we know as reality. Did you know every electromagnetic field takes the shape of a Torah. These fields  spiral out in both directions, from a center, or source. The bigger the electromagnetic field, the more information contained within. It is absolutely impossible for life to randomly come about. There is a sound, that causes everything, form spiral snail shells, to the Fibonacci pattern that spirals out of flowers when they bloom. Scientist have a hard time describing what exactly a field is. When you look at the universe and nature, you see this pattern in everything. The planet hold our magnetic field in, we call it gravity. The Sun holds all the planets in place. The Galaxy hold the Sun in place. The universe holds the galaxy in place, and I have no doubt the universe takes the same torroidial shape. The universe is probably held in place, by what scientists call, the multiverse. This field is present in life. These fields are present in planets. These fields are present in stars. These fields are present in galaxies. It is not a human body, it is a biomechanical quantum supercomputer. The bigger the field, the more information contained within. Field, held within field, infinitely. They can't get a solar system to form  in computer simulations, with gravity the only acting force. Furthermore how did everything haphazardly collide during the early formation of the solar system, with gravity as the only active force, and everything luckily settles on equator line of the Sun. That don't even make sense. There is the force of the wave. The wave is emitted from the field. The people who are sure souls don't exist, are the same people that said, you will never get a heavier than air craft off the ground. What causes the proteins and molecules to arrange in certain patterns, the wave. What causes snowflakes to freeze in a five-sided beautiful geometric pattern, the wave. What they teach us in school, is not the truth. If you want a better understanding, YouTube the sound of sacred geometry. If you want to know why snowflakes take the five Side pattern every time they fall . YouTube The Flower of Life. I was a smug atheist until an episode of the universe was showing solar system formation. They were describing planet hitting planet. Then everything ,  as if by miracle , or grace of God , just settles on the ecliptic plane of our star. Really? If gravity is the only acting force as we were taught in school, shouldn't we all hazardly orbit the Sun? That's an explanation, by our scientists, not a very realistic one. Some people when offered the easiest explanation,  just go with it, No research. As long as the person telling has some kind of indoctrinated teaching, most people accept it. If you think of space as a calm pool of water. Then think of the Sun as a giant pebble, dropped into that calm water.

They are really small close to the Sun, As the wave gets wider more, and more, debri migrates to the lower part of the wave.

My birth details are. 12 Dec 1989, 6:45 PM Indore. Having Gemini lagna, Jupiter in 1st house, saturn and mercury in 7th house, Venus and rahu in 8th house, mars and sun in 6th house, moon exalted in tauras in 12th house.Now let me tell you my Jupiter mahadasha started In 2014. Before that I have faced rahu maha dasha from 1996 to 2014. Just after starting Jupiter dasha I felt many changes in life especially I am diverted to sprituallity, astrology, now I am devotee, I cant do anything wrong even if I want to do. I think its because aspect of 9th lord saturn on 1st house as it is placed in 7th house. 9th lord and 10th lord mutually aspecting each other. Jupiter is in 1st house being the lord of 7th house and 10th house. Even though I have not got the success I am seeking but this Jupiter made me optimistik and Saturn aspect on lagn made me hardworking. Saturn aspect made me engineering professional. I am mechanical engineer and working with family business of heavy machines. I face hurdles but I don't have any complain to it. Because this Saturn is a promise for success but after hard work and that I like. Yes I have faced the worst time of my life between 2008-2011 rahu-Venus period. Felt in relation and hurted tooo much and experienced worst things and prayed got to take my life. This Jupiter always reminds my limits being a good human with morality . Jupiter in 1st house was also working that time, never made me to cross my limits and stoped me to do even a bit wrong. Yes rahu made me to some wrong but jupiter stopped to go to extreme of it. What I am saying extreme is normal now a days.Thus I have a very good character and yes one bad thing of this placement is I never compromise with wrong things even if my family members do any wrong deed. I appose them and by default cant see anything wrong happening around me. This makes people around me to fight me and yes one thing is sure I never lose the fight of right and wrong. the planets mars and sun in sixth house gives courage to win the battle. But it is very challenging placement now a days. But I cant do anything. Right now I am unmarried. Saturn in 7th house delaying it but will give good result. just after Jupiter dasha started in 2014 I gained 15-20kg weight. I am not overweight but under normal BMI. Before I was slim and now fine neither slim nor fat. I have fair complexion attractive look. Jupiter gives in 1st house. Yes it forces to walk on righteous path. Retrograte Jupiter is more strong. Yes it minimize the dosha effects in kundali by giving knowledge.(here in my case)As you can see Jupiter bent me towards astrology and sprituality and I am able to understand that whatever happened wrong to me because rahu-Venus. That was a karmic backlog I have from past life and I paid it in specific period. And next I got hint to what bad and good going to be happen in futur. Thus I have did some good deed so I got Jupiter in 1st house. Its slow moving planet will give results slowely.Overall it protects in many ways. It tells what is right what is wrong. And if make us realize to improve ourself before saying others wrong. And one can study my chart and ask me if want to ask anything about any placement and result.It is not a right thing to share birth details publicly but if anyone wants to study and learn from live examples he can learn and ask.ThanksArpit Verma
what can be done to reduce the pollution of india	what is the best way to reduce pollution in india	1	“Thanks for A to A”.Pollution is even deadlier than war, disaster and hunger.It can be categorized under various types; Air, Water, Noise, Soil, Radioactive, Light etc. I would like to talk specifically about Air Pollution and measures to be taken by the People and the Government in particular. There are various causes and solutions to air pollution in India also there are various stakeholders involved. Let’s look out how two of them can make a significant impact.1- WE, the Mango People-1. Drive an electric or hybrid car or at least one that uses unleaded petrol, keep our car in good running condition to avoid emissions, Share a ride/carpool, use public transportation system, or choose to walk/ride a bicycle whenever possible.2. Never use open fires to dispose of waste, especially chemicals and plastic.3. Adopt the golden 3 R’s of solid waste management: Reduce, Reuse, and Recycle.4. Conserve Energy by using energy efficient appliances and Harness the renewable sources of power for Eg: Wind and Sun.5. Buy local foods and goods wherever possible. In this manner, the use of fuel for transporting goods can be minimized.6. Avoid plastics, always bring a bag when you shop. Use and buy products that are eco-friendly or made with biodegradable materials.7. Plant more trees. They clean the air, provide oxygen, and beautify your surroundings.8. Do not litter. Start an anti-litter campaign to educate your community. Education is Power.2- How can Big Boss be helpful-1. Promotion of public transport network of metro, buses, e-rickshaws and promotion of car pooling, lane discipline, vehicle maintenance etc. It would be awesome to provide free/cheaper modes of public transportation.2. Strict and comprehensive implementation of Laws/Rules such as The Forest Conservation Act, 1980, Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981, EPA 1986 etc.3. Gasification to avoid burning of crop residue (straw and stubble burning in Punjab, Haryana, UP).4. Scrapping of CAMPA (Compensatory Afforestation Fund Management and Planning Authority) and strict protection of forests. (this point may have some divergent opinions)5. Proper pavement of roads, Vacuuming of road dust.6. Rights based Forest Management.7. Urban Forestry.8. Introduction of cleaner/alternate fuels like gaseous fuel (CNG, LPG etc.), ethanol blend etc.9. Taxing polluting vehicles and incentivising hybrid and electric vehicles.10. Installation of on-line continuous (24x7) monitoring devices by major industries.Some of the steps are already taken by govt such as -Implementation of BS-IV norms in 63 selected cities and universalisation by 2017. Decision to leapfrog directly from BS-IV to BS-VI fuel standards by 1st April, 2020.Setting up of monitoring network for assessment of ambient air quality.Though this is not the comprehensive answer to the big-big problem of pollution but I am pretty sure that the above mentioned steps, if applied will definitely have a significant impact.“One person alone cannot save the planet’s biodiversity, but each individual’s effort to encourage nature’s wealth must not be underestimated.— United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP)”cheers :)	India is right after China when it comes to countries with high level of air pollution. The government needs to take immediate measure otherwise the air will soon go from unhealthy to hazardous. Here are a few steps that can be taken-A proper and clean public transport will encourage citizens to avoid taking their own cars around. If the government can successfully reduce the number of cars on the roads, there will be a considerable improvement in the quality of air.When China made an initiative to control its population, they observed a decline in their pollution level gradually. Indian government needs to take the same measures to control the level of population as it has positive impact on the environment.Trees help in maintaining the quality of air and deforestation has lead to a decrease in the air quality. Restricting deforestation altogether and planting more trees will help in improving the air quality.Monitoring the air quality in local areas and spreading awareness among citizens about the AQI in their areas is an essential step towards reducing the air pollution. Furthermore, the government should encourage individuals to use a smart air quality monitor in their homes, and offices to measure indoor air quality on a personal level and take preventive measures when the air is unhealthy.

what  the meaning of i gotta take a shit	what does i fancy you mean	0	AB 1729…was promoted as a way to give schools more flexible tools in dealing with habitually defiant students. It was followed up with AB 420 which pretty much banned expulsion for defiance.In reality, there were no new tools for dealing with defiant behavior. Teachers just have to absorb a lot more defiance, disrespect and abuse from students. They also had to jump through more hoops before we can use the old tools. It also means that the defiance has to escalate to even worse behaviors before the student faces consequences.A couple years ago I had a student who was habitually defiant and seemed to pepper every conversation with at least a few F-words and Sh-words. Instead of asking for a bathroom pass he’d come up and say, “I gotta take a shit.” But even worse, he would refuse to work as he preferred that someone give him answers. And if I wouldn’t give him answers, he would wander the room trying to cheat off of others right in front of me. Despite his habitual defiance, this student was never suspended for defiance. It was only after he threatened to “kick the ass” of a substitute teacher or “beat the ass” of an autistic student did he face any real consequences. By the end of the semester, it was a constant struggle to keep him from disrupting class full time.And if you’re getting a mental picture of a black or Hispanic street tough, think again. This was a self entitled white kid with expensive clothes who made a point of talking ghetto. So I also had to see this every day and he defiantly refused to pull his pants up.Now I haven’t gotten to the worst part. The laws are so broadly written that they make it hard to discipline students for things other than defiance.One memorable student broke into one of the biology labs and stole 2 digital scales. When they caught him, he had the scales in his backpack along with a book on how to grow and sell marijuana. Administration didn’t think they could suspend this student for stealing valuable and expensive lab equipment because his parents had not been previously contact for stealing scales. Yes it’s that absurd.That student would eventually be transferred into my class because he was defiant and abusive to a female teacher. They couldn’t stop the behavior, so they moved him into my class. I’m a 6′2″, 250lb martial artist so they figured that if his behavior escalated, it was safer to have him in my class.The lack of discipline taught this student an important but dangerous message, that he could get away with doing what ever he wanted. Shortly after graduation, he made the local news for a one-day crime spree that included multiple instances of purse snatching.The worst thing about AB 1729 and AB 420 is the harm it’s doing to kids. I’m not talking about the kids who come to school to learn. Yes it’s hurting them. But the kids these laws are hurting most is the kids with behavior problems. I grew up fatherless and in unstable circumstances. I had lots of bad influences and acted out. I was a discipline problem. But I was sent to a Catholic school for 3 years and the teachers there used assertive discipline to mold me into a productive member of society. So Instead of snatching purses from little old ladies, I’m a professional with 2 masters degrees.Letting kids get away with defiance is not helping them, it’s hurting them.	I just met this guy. He said he really likes me and wants to date me. I told him I don't have any special feeling for him yet, and it is too fast. He told me it was okay but never contacted me again. What does this mean?

The city is Planned, in a damn good way. It was planned by HK Mewada and Prakash M Apte, who worked as trainees under Legendary Architect Le Corbusier, the architect who designed Chandigarh. The plan somewhat looks like this.​(Image source: Page on indiatravelite.com )2. Some one said about Greenery. This is the Greenest City in Asia with 54% forest cover of its total area. For instance, a normal city has 150 Trees per 100 persons, but this city has more than 400 trees per 100 which is very high.​​( Image Source: www.swastikrealbiz.com)3. Has a market place in every 1 Sq. Km where one can find all the basic daily needs.4. Has got garden in every sector where people spend time with families.Few of the Gardens are so well made that they do attract lots of people from outside.​​( Image Source: www.omnilexica.com) 5. The normal view of a road is like this. Its not a Highway, but only a Sector Road.​​( Image Source: epaper.timesofindia.com)6. Temples! There is Akshar Dham, Gandhi Mandir, and many small temples in each sector.​​(Image Source: www.travelguru.com)7. Has got very less traffic. A busy day somewhat looks like this.​​( Image source: Xossip)8. Pollution, naah, I couldn't find any.9. And the best part are the people.

what is working hard not in terms of studying	what is working hard in terms of studying	0	It depends on whom you ask.For a desk job, you are fully committed to your task, feel responsible for your work.To a factory worker, the person behind a desk is not working at all.To an average factory worker, working hard means putting in more hours then it states on his contract.For some it means really working harder, faster.And there are a few, who did a certain task yesterday in 58 minutes, today they will do it in 57 or figuratively speaking, die trying.In my factory ‘career’ I was one of those.Everything I did was a race with myself.My coworkers were all day watching the clock to see how long they had to go before going home.I was watching the clock to see if I improved my time.Not because my boss paid me to do more, he didn’t.I liked it, that job made me fit. Any factory job that didn’t let me go full speed, was not the right job for me. I needed to be free to do the things my way, more efficient every day, faster every day.You don’t get tired from such work, you get energized.I also had a desk job when I got older, it is very different.You don’t get energized from those, you actually get tired.Sitting down on a chair for 8 hours doesn’t really get the blood pumping.	Being thorough and make sure you complete all sample questions and cases in your course material. Read through all course material thoroughly. Doing sample questions and tests to make sure you can answer them all and therefore can head into a test or exam with confidence.

which were some of the bad experiences you had in life	what were some of your good and bad life experiences	1	Everyone thinks I exaggerate when I tell them this story, but hey, this happened, you believe it or not.I was standing at Trivandrum Central railway station waiting for my train to Mumbai. I had just arrived there from Nagercoil via another passenger train.As I stood there looking around aimlessly, I took a look at the pile of luggage lying next to me. It was mine. There was a sack full of coconuts (because Keralites eat, drink, sleep and live coconuts) and a carton filled with Kerala specialty snacks and another carton that had a jackfruit that weighed at least ten kilograms (yes, we kinda like jackfruits too).I notice that I have a piece of luggage missing.Oh. that’s my backpack. Surely, it’s on my back………. SHIT. It’s not.I feel salt water filling my mouth. I look around. My backpack is nowhere to be seen. I count my luggage. I had five units in total. Yes, there were only four now. I feel my shoulders again and no, there is nothing hanging there. Then I remember the contents of the bag.Food. Okay, not that big of a loss. Manageable.My Kindle. That shit cost me like 10,000 bucks.*Wipes sweat from the brow*My laptop. Cost me 35,000 bucks but more than the money, it contained invaluable things including a full year of lab work; all my experiments, results, graphs, projections. My stomach begins to churn.Finally, I turn to my uncle who had come to see me off and tell him I might have a bag missing. He asks me the contents and I tell him. He looks like he wants to slap me because of course, I deserve to be slapped.We conclude that I might have left it in the passenger train that we had used to come to Trivandrum from Nagercoil. That was over 20 minutes ago. I run into the station master’s office and tell him my story and ask him where the train is now. He tells me it has been sent to the yard at Kochuveli station which is exactly 8 kilometers away. And it’s a desolate place filled with rag pickers who scavenge through the countless trains that arrive there each day. If I started now, maybe I could recover my bag back, said the station master, “But I wouldn’t bet on it,” were his final words.Now, I had a problem. My train was to arrive in less than 10 minutes and so me going there was out of the question. So, my uncle says he will, and leaves immediately.As soon as my uncle left the station, he wanted to catch an auto, but unsurprisingly no one wants to go and those who will, are in line, so that will take some time, which he does not have.Seeing him look for an auto desperately, an RPF constable asks him what the problem is and he tells him. Well, guess what? That dude brings out his bike and offers to take my uncle to Kochuveli. He was about to travel there for his next shift anyway he said, so why not go a bit earlier. Bless his soul.My train had arrived and I was sitting inside knowing full well that I would have to go home without the bag and hear my father expound upon being a man and taking responsibility in life.Meanwhile, my uncle reaches Kochuveli and the constable takes him to the RPF police station there. They listen to him and send two other constables with him to go bag hunting. They walk through the knee-high grass and empty rakes on all sides and finally find the train. They get in and start combing through the compartments one by one.I get a call. It says “Fazal Mama”. I know it’s bad news. They never found it. Some ragpicker had had a lucky day. He had stumbled on 40k worth of gadgets and some nice idlis and chicken biryanis for his family.I receive the call.“What was in your bag?”“Huh?”“I asked you what was in your bag?”“Umm.. Food..”“No, just the expensive stuff.”“A laptop and a Kindle.”“How much do they cost approximately?”“I don’t know, around 40k?”“Okay.”I waited for a few seconds. He was doing something on the other end. Then he spoke again.“We found your bag. Everything’s in it. I was filling out a form ...	The best and worst moments of my life happen to be on the same day.I’ll start with the worst moment of my life.My mother was diagnosed with cancer and after a few months of chemotherapy, she underwent a major surgery to remove the tumor.My life was already the worst.After the surgery, mom was in the ICU for more than 5 days. One evening, I was allowed to visit her in the ICU.Till that day I had seen ICU’s only in movies.I put on the scrubs and walked in. I passed through three other patients before seeing my mom.I became numb. The huge machines were beeping. There were catheters and tubes attached all over my mother. She looked completely pale. She spoke to me for a little while. She complained that she hasn’t even had a sip of water for three days (She was being tube fed). She complained that her compression stockings were too tight (Compression stockings are tight socks used after surgery to prevent blood clots developing in the leg) I loosened them for her. The duty doctor arrived. My mother introduced me to the doctor. She told her that I had donated blood for her and that I was very brave. And she cried.I stood there with a blank face. Bottling up my emotions is something that I am very good at. So I neither smiled nor shed a tear. I stood there expressionless.My five minutes were over and I was asked to leave.That was the worst moment of my life.I came outside and my dad dropped me till the bus stop so I could go home. It was a forty minute bus ride from the hospital.Sitting in the bus, I was texting my crush. During those hard times, he was my biggest emotional support. He knew that I liked him. I had confessed to him long back.He was from another city, so we mostly communicated through texts.While we were texting, he started saying weird things. Then he confessed to me that he liked me too!With crappy mobile data, I was having trouble sending and and receiving the texts (I was using 2G back then). I was very nervous and very, very confused.It was a very funny conversation.I was ecstatic! I looked out of the bus window. It was almost dark, and the whole city was decked up in lights to celebrate my happiness! (But actually, those were the lights from the vehicles stuck in the huge traffic jam) I was smiling ear to ear. I was so happy I started trembling. It was also a bit chilly outside. I just wanted to jump up and down because I was very happy!. I somehow managed my excitement, and got down at my stop. I just wanted to keep talking to him but I had to walk back home from the bus stop. I had the biggest smile on my face.That was the best moment of my life.Later in the evening I got to know that my mom will be discharged from the ICU and will sent home in a week. Everybody in my family was happy because my mom would be home to celebrate the Dusshera festival.So, those were the worst and best moments of my life, on the same day.Edit: Many people in the comments asked about my mom’s health . Thank you so much for your love. My mom has recovered and is doing really great now <3As for my crush, we dated for a while but we are not together now.Thanks for reading (:
why is timbaland famous	which brand of drums does timbaland use	0	Timbaland is called Timbaland because Timbaland chose the name Timbaland for himself. Timbaland liked the name Timbaland and therefore, Timbaland thought that he should call himself Timbaland. Others around Timbaland agreed that Timbaland was a cool name and so, everyone around Timbaland decided to call him Timbaland. Gradually, the name stuck, and then slowly some folks started getting confused about why Timbaland was called Timbaland. Such folks asked their dads about Timbaland and why Timbaland was called Timbaland and the dads had no clue about Timbaland or why Timbaland was called Timbaland.	Timbal and uses an Open Labs synth. This is basically an all and one computer/synth that can run anything from Kontakt to Reason to Pro Tools. It also has a built in feature that will automatically sample outboard synths for you. Great machines.

do you have to wake up during rem sleep to remember your dreams	do you need to wake up in the middle of rem sleep in order to remember you dreams	1	Most often - yes. There are two most important factors responsible for remembering dreams.One - waking up during or just after a dream. When dreaming, whole brain lights up, and so is visual cortex. When you wake up from REM sleep, there’s high chance you’ll still have afterimages of your dream under your eyelids.Second factor is emotions - the more emotional the dream, the higher chances of remembering it.

what are common required and elective courses in agriculture	what are common required and elective courses in philosophy	0	As a BME major, I have to take the following types of courses(yes, I checked several universities to ensure these are common)The basic intro engineering load all universities require of all their engineering majors - calculus, multivariable calculus, and differential equations for math, and at least one semester of general chemistry and calculus based mechanics and electromagnetism for science, as well as a semester of computer science for scientific computing later. My university then adds linear algebra to the math requirement(and I think statistics), and requires an “ENGRI”, a freshman level science/engineering class in some more specialized thing (stuff like nanotechnology, intro MechE/ChemE/BME, and Lasers/Photonics, for example). BME also required intro cell biology or physiology and a bio lab - some intro bio is absolutely unavoidable.Physiology. Yeah, you're unlikely to get away with just intro biology, you're going to have to do more than that. I personally am doing a “physiology of health and disease” class now, and will do a “electrical and chemical physiology” class later. That will be three physiology classes by graduation, since I did intro physiology for the intro bio. Admittedly, my university is a bit insane, but you will probably end up doing at least some physiology specifically. After all, physiology literally is the study of how the body works- wouldn't it be insane to engineer something that you don't understand how it works? BME without physiology is like not knowing how an engine works but wanting to engineer a better engine - completely nonsensical. So yeah, physiology is going to be there.Statics, a classic mechanical engineering course. It's not necessarily normal to take specifically the same statics as MechEs as I did(I'm actually required to specifically do this in my university, though), but I believe I see some sort of advanced mechanics above the freshman level for all the other BME curriculums I looked at. You're expected to wear a little of a MechE hat as a BME.Circuits/signals/imaging/instrumentation. This is a bit less standardized, but all are sort of important to a BME. In my case, I'm currently taking a “biomedical signals” course that does things like figure out how to recover a blood oxygen level from the light signals of a pulse oximeter - signal processing here, and that's an electrical engineering topic. Later I'll take a “biomedical instrumentation” class that has to do with things like sensors and measurements - one of the projects is analyzing the way people walk - I imagine this goes slightly back to the signals class. Your exact depth into this may well depend on the exact university you attend, but I believe some level of introduction to these things are pretty universal. After all, some sort of ability to gather/analyze real biomedical data is really fundamental to be able to pretty much do anything useful like a new drug or device. Of course, you can even concentrate in this.Fluid mechanics/mass transfer/anything chemE, really. In my case, we combined much of this in a “biomedical transport phenomena” class. We covered fluid mechanics, a little chemical kinetics, and mass transfer, in biological scenarios like flow through an artery, receptor ligand binding, tissue oxygenation, and drug delivery/pharmacokinetics. We also do some chemical thermodynamics in a “biomolecular thermodynamics” class. If you walk away with a BME degree without knowing any of that, I would be seriously shocked - you just can't do BME without this chemE hat. You need it to kind of get how the body works at a lower level - even if chemE stuff can make you want to cry at times.Engineering modeling of physiology. (Yes, I, and biomedical engineering departments, consider this distinct from the physiology itself) This is sort of covered in something like my transport course I described above, but the point is that you will universally need to know how to model biological processes. This is covered by a smattering of everything else and a “engineering analysis of metabolic and structural systems” senior year class.A materials course of some kind. “Biomaterials” in my case, you care about materials a decent bit as a BME. The moment you want something in the body, you have to consider things like whether the material both has the needed mechanical and electrical properties, but also how it may chemically react with the body.Like any true engineering major, a senior design project.You can see that's really broad. As such, electives are pretty much exclusively used to further concentrate on a specific subset of BME. For exampleI'm interested in tissue engineering or drug delivery. So I'd delve deeper into chemical engineering concepts, particularly for drug delivery. I need to know more stuff on the mass transfer behind drug delivery, for example. Incidentally, that's also important to understand issues like inadequate tissue perfusion in tissue engineering. I may also try to take some more biology if I go to tissue engineering.A BME friend wants to do instrumentation. So he'd focus on understanding sensors and data collection better than the one instrumentation class he got. Maybe even electrical engineering classes for the most relevant bits.Those interested in biomechanics may take even further mechanics than statics and its equivalent. I'm talking soft tissue mechanics classes and dynamics/other traditional MechE classes.Yeah, that's the thing. It's such a broad field I needed this long of an answer to address everything.	"So my school's curriculum had me take something like 2 semesters of history of philosophy courses, 2 Intro courses, 4 (or more) upper level courses, and a metaphysics or logic course (I chose logic). I think they also required a few 3000-level electives in the philosophy majorEDIT: I also did a thesis (which was a 4 credit 4000-level course)...I highly recommend doing an independent study in your discipline. It's invaluable to see ""how the pros do it"" and also to have the opportunity to contribute and interact at a professional level in your discipline."

who is capable of ending google  monopoly in search	will google  virtual monopoly in web search ever end when	0	I’m not sure exactly “who” might be capable of ending Google’s™ ‘monopoly’ in search…but my guess is that it will be whoever solves the problems of language differences, language multiple meanings, language expressions, question-search, and other things that now essentially stand in the way of the ‘holy-grail’ of search…that is, for you and I to be able to ask a question and get THE BEST ANSWER on the first try.I envision the future will solve these issues, and we will eventually get to that point…much like Star-Trek™: “Computer…what is the evidence known about life on planet XYZ?”.And, the Computer talks right back with its first and final answer, since it has been designed (and, perhaps through advanced AI, has literally ‘evolved’?) to know how to parse ‘search queries’ to finite levels of understanding, then produce the necessary response, which is “the very best, thoroughly ‘vetted’ information available relating to this search query”.When (if?) this happens, people will not need to scroll through pages and pages of “hits” like we do today. Don’t get me wrong…Google has done wonderful things to help bring information to our fingertips…but there’s more to come, I’m sure.Thus, it behooves us (users) to learn as much as we can about how forming our search queries properly can ultimately help improve accuracy and productivity simply through more efficient, more effective search.Eventually, the Internet, as an ‘organic-cloud-entity’ will learn more and more about how we seek the information we need, and, if developed appropriately, will ultimately be able to hone in on those “golden nuggets” we all seek when we “Google” (or, will there be a new term someday? - time alone will tell!) something, y’know?Just sayin’…	A third obstacle, which is just as big, is the network effect on the advertiser side. Because Google has so much traffic, it gets the bulk of attention and $$ from advertisers. Managing keyword campaigns takes time and money. Some advertisers don't even bother with other search networks because the incremental benefit isn't that great. This has the impact that Google can pay more for distribution than other players can because they make more money per search. (Unless other players are willing to lose money to build brand/distribution.)
can an auto immune disease cause insomnia	what causes auto immune diseases	0	Many autoimmune disorders cause muscle and joint pain â€” which can interfere with sleep. Your immune system may attack cells involved in sleep processes. Researchers recently determined that narcolepsy, a condition in which people fall asleep suddenly and without intention, is an autoimmune disorder.Watch this for more possible causes:If you’re struggling with Insomnia long term then Insomnia TV has some great videos and a free download for a 14 sleep makeover which is perfect for sticking on when you’re trying to sleep: (Full Free Audiobook 14 Day Sleep Makeover) Sleep Smarter: 21 Essential Strategies to SleepWhat keeps you up at night? Pondering deep questions? Excitement about a big trip? Or is it stress about unfinished work, an upcoming test, or a dreaded family gathering? For many people, this stress is temporary, as its cause is quickly resolved. But what if the very thing keeping you awake was stress about losing sleep? This seemingly unsolvable loop is at the heart of insomnia, the world’s most common sleep disorder. Almost anything can cause the occasional restless night a snoring partner, physical pain, or emotional distress.And extreme sleep deprivation like jetlag can throw off your biological clock, wreaking havoc on your sleep schedule. But in most cases, sleep deprivation is short term. Eventually, exhaustion catches up with all of us. However, some long term conditions like respiratory disorders, gastrointestinal problems, and many others can overpower fatigue. And as sleepless nights pile up, the bedroom can start to carry associations of restless nights wracked with anxiety.Come bedtime, insomniacs are stressed. So stressed their brains hijack the stress response system, flooding the body with fight flight or freeze chemicals. Cortisol and adrenocorticotropic hormones course through the bloodstream, increasing heart rate and blood pressure, and jolting the body into hyperarousal. In this condition, the brain is hunting for potential threats, making it impossible to ignore any slight discomfort or nighttime noise. And when insomniacs finally do fall asleep, the quality of their rest is compromised.Our brain’s primary source of energy is cerebral glucose, and in healthy sleep, our metabolism slows to conserve this glucose for waking hours. But PET studies show the adrenaline that prevents sleep for insomniacs also speeds up their metabolisms. While they sleep, their bodies are working overtime, burning through the brain’s supply of energy giving glucose. This symptom of poor sleep leaves insomniacs waking in a state of exhaustion, confusion, and stress, which starts the process all over again.When these cycles of stress and restlessness last several months, they’re diagnosed as chronic insomnia. And while insomnia rarely leads to death, its chemical mechanisms are similar to anxiety attacks found in those experiencing depression and anxiety. So suffering from any one of these conditions increases your risk of experiencing the other two. Fortunately, there are ways to break the cycle of sleeplessness.Managing the stress that leads to hyperarousal is one of our best understood treatments for insomnia, and good sleep practices can help rebuild your relationship with bedtime. Make sure your bedroom is dark and comfortably cool to minimize “threats” during hyperarousal. Only use your bed for sleeping, and if you’re restless, leave the room and tire yourself out with relaxing activities like reading, meditating, or journaling. Regulate your metabolism by setting consistent resting and waking times to help orient your body’s biological clock.This clock, or circadian rhythm, is also sensitive to light, so avoid bright lights at night to help tell your body that it’s time for sleep. In addition to these practices, some doctors prescribe medication to aid sleep, but there aren’t reliable medications that help in all cases. And over the counter sleeping pills can be highly addictive, leading to withdrawal that worsens symptoms. But before seeking any treatment, make sure your sleeplessness is actually due to insomnia.Approximately 8% of patients diagnosed with chronic insomnia are actually suffering from a less common genetic problem called delayed sleep phase disorder, or DSPD. People with DSPD have a circadian rhythm significantly longer than 24 hours, putting their sleeping habits out of sync with traditional sleeping hours. So while they have difficulty falling asleep at a typical bedtime, it’s not due to increased stress. And given the opportunity, they can sleep comfortably on their own delayed schedule.Our sleeping and waking cycle is a delicate balance, and one that’s vital to maintain for our physical and mental wellbeing. For all these reasons, it’s worth putting in some time and effort to sustain a stable bedtime routine, but try not to lose any sleep over it…	If you mean what goes on in the body when a person has an autoimmune disease, let me first explain how the normal immune system works...How The Immune System WorksThe body's immune system protects you  from disease-causing agents such as viruses, bacteria, fungi and other harmful substances shown above by producing antibodies. Antibodies are proteins that recognize foreign harmful substances that invade the body.   Once these antibodies recognize these disease-causing substances as harmful foreign bodies, they fight them off by destroying them.What Happens When A Person Has An Autoimmune DisorderHowever, when a person has an autoimmune disease, there's an abnormality in the way the immune system responds.auto = self or same in Greek....his own immune system produces antibodies against his own tissues.   These antibodies attack the person's own healthy tissues. They're treating the person's own healthy cells as if they're foreign bodies.  Since the healthy tissues are being attacked by his own immune system, organ destruction or dysfunction will occur.  Example: Let's take Type I Diabetes (not included in photo above)The pancreas, that gland you see below, is attacked by a person's own immune system.  The antibodies are treating the pancreas as foreign to the body. As a result, the beta cells in the pancreas (photo below) are destroyed. Therefore, the beta cells  produce little or no insulin, a hormone that transports glucose (sugar) in the body's cells to be used as energy. This is why patients with Type I Diabetes need to inject insulin since it's not being produced.  As a matter of fact, the old name for this disease was Insulin-Dependent Diabetes (IDD).Now, if your question meant what causes the abnormal immune response that leads to an autoimmune disease, it's unknown.  That's why there's no cure for those common autoimmune diseases shown in the third picture.
does gta iv work in windows 7	does gta iv work on windows 10	0	Yes it is working fine in window 7 or vista but please see all PC configuration for this game.If all Configuration is well as like game recommendation you can play it as well i play.Grand Theft Auto 4-(7 MB) Highly Compressed Full Version Pc Game Torrent	I’ve heard of a few issues that are most commonly resolved as shown below. Generally as long as you remember to run the installation in Compatibility Mode (for GTA IV use WinXP SP3) it will install and run without any errors. I’m running 16-bit games that have been in storage for almost 20 years in Windows 10, something not possible with earlier versions such as Windows 7! The registry hack is as follows:Open regedit.exe from an elevated command prompt.Locate HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Windows and locate CSDVersion within the key. Right click and modify the key value to 100The above must be accomplished PRIOR to installation of the game. After modification of the key, navigate to the game’s DVD and ‘right-click’ on the ‘setup.exe’ file in the GTA IV folder, choose properties and check the ‘run this program in compatibility mode’ and choose Windows XP SP3. Apply. Then ‘right-click’ the same setup file and choose ‘run as administrator’ and you should have no problems.This REQUIRES a registry edit so I recommend you make a backup copy prior to following any of these steps and neither I, nor Quora, can be held responsible if altering your registry in any away causes problems with your system. If you are NOT familiar with the registry editor or don’t understand the key structure then I recommend you find someone that is to perform this type of work on your system.
which is the best ssc and banking training insititute in chandigarh	which institute provide best ssc and banking coaching in chandigarh	1	Foremost thing that matters in clearing any competitive exam is the approach and direction. This is further dependent on the Faculty, Study Material, Mentoring and other important factors.Many of us get into some institutes where a lot of students have already given there attempts 3–4 times or batch strength is more than 30. A beginner can never understand and start from the concepts in these kind of classes. Also, some institutes hire inexperienced faculty and do injustice to their students.I would suggest look for an institute where initially you can attend free demo classes(more than 1), Study material should be updated, faculty who is expert in their subjects like Quant, LR, GS or English, and provide updated testing environment.I have a keen interest in guiding aspirants for govt. jobs and other fields too. I researched about various institutions in Chandigarh by visiting and attending demo classes. I found some are really good in teaching but batch sizes are 30+, some have good material and testing but faculty is inexperienced.There was one institute in Sector 34-A named “My Career”. They have started the institute afresh in Chandigarh although have quite well-reputed center in Bathinda (as some sources told me from the city). Main benefit is it is run by IIM Alumni and very experienced faculty who have actually taught students for MBA. Study material is also fine. Major plus point here would be that they have started in the city, so they are really working hard to give good results and provide good coaching & training to students and hence excel in the league. So, after all research and counsel, I would recommend My Career Institute to all for SSC and Banking Coaching. You guys can atleast visit and attend demo classes there.

Each and everyday, each and every night I use to promise myself saying that tomorrow I will wake up early in the morning even during exams !. But that “Tomorrow” never used to come. With all my force and effort I used to wake up sometimes but the gravitational force was so high that every time I used to lose the battle against it.I was not a morning person at all. So I have decided to do something for it. Finally I installed an app called “Alarmy (Sleep if You can)”Attention you Sleepyhead !!This is pretty well organised.Say you set an alarm at 5 in the morning and there are ways to dismiss the alarm in the morning. It will ask some maths problems or it will ask you to shake your phone 100 times! or it will ask you to scan bar code or it will ask you to take photo and match with particular photo with which you have already taken previously !!. You can change any method of turning off the alarm here.

Deliver.Deliver on this plea from the person that you love.Because oh my god the spiral of your earlobe.Because look - look at the lines on the palm of your hand. I want to trace them until I feel your life line line up with mine.Here. Let’s put our hands flat against each other.Because, look at the curve of your neck - your leg - your waist - the arch of your foot. How could I not love someone who carries curves like you carry curves?Because, I can barely breathe when you look at me like that.Because you want. Because you try. Because you search. Because you are hungry like me, afraid like me, contradictory like me. Because you are nothing like me.Because I like me when I’m with you.But mostly because I don’t need a reason. Because. Just because.Because is all I will ever need to love you.Related:Dushka Zapata's answer to What should I say when my boyfriend ask why I love him?	Among the billion interesting things in the world, my heart flutters each time I do a bit of them:1.Sleeping.I am not lazy, okay. I just love to preserve my energy for a grilling day ahead by cuddling with my soft pillow. Sleep calms my brain and clears the chaotic thoughts. It is my escape from the harsh realities. Sometimes, a good nap solves everything. Dear Bed, I love you..:*2. Walking.Tap, tap, tap…my feet are moving, leaving behind the crap..oh..tap, tap, tap..!!. Yeah, a good morning walk is all you need to be happy. Apart from burning calories, it lifts you up from the monotony and adorns you with the zest of positive energy. So, wake up, tie your shoes, and walk to experience the new..:)3. Sipping tea.Aah..!! tea is not just a beverage, it’s pure love. It’s the relief to my ache, the peace to my soul. It is the warm hug in a cup. A tea bag stores all the lifes solutions. Want to see me happy? Just add some ginger in this magical drink, boil it well with your love and tada, I’ll be beaming with a radiant smile. Wanna go for a tea date??4. Reading.It is said that reading is dreaming with open eyes. Yeah, I love to weave my dreams around beautiful words. Words that are powerful. Words that are unique. Be it Quora, a book, or FB, my eyes always search for something that could make me better. Between the pages of a book is a lovely place to be..!!5. Singing.No, no, I don’t own any accolades in the blissful world of music but humming some soulful lyrics of phenomenally written songs makes me smile. Music is my sanity. Haal kaisa hai Quora ka..kya khyal hai hai apka..okay I’ll stop, otherwise Quora will ban me for this. Cmon, I am not such a bad singer..!!!6. Stalking.Okay, okay, now keep those judgy eyes off from me. I am neither a cruel stalker nor I will disturb your peace with my excessive gazing. I stalk beautiful divas for some fashion gyan and drool over fantastic men for umm..for no reason..it’s spontaneous..!! I am an ideal admirer of beauty not a filthy brain of garbage. Oh..just stop judging me now..!!7. Arranging.Oh yeah, I suffer from OAD - Obsessive Arranging Disorder. Any damn thing leaving its safe tunnel brings tears to my eyes. I love to keep things in a clean, tidy manner. From patiently stacked clothes in my cupboard to perfectly segregated photos in my gallery, I love the arranged order.8. Mimicking.Ee sasura Quora ne toh hamre time ki le li..( This Quora has simply robbed my time..!!). Bihari, Haryanvi, Marwari, my tongue loves to twist in different accents. It’s a real fun to play with varied forms of languages. From Jeevan’s, Han han bhanje to Shakti Kapoor’s, Aau..Lolita., I try to spice up my life with the pinch of laughter..:DThanks 4 A2A..

i missed the iit what should i do	when should i expect my joining date for accenture the timeline shows its 24 dec 2016 and i havent recieved any updates from the organisation	0	It's okayMe too missed IIT.But frankly speaking,this has never meant that your future is dark or something similar to that..Rather I believe that if one has the potential no institute matters at all..So my suggestion to anyone would be like One should go to NIT or some State Gov institute and pursue without wasting a year..	Currently IBM is in biggest financial crises.so it stopped hiring 2017 freshers completely offering only for 2018 passed outs that means for next coming year.so u can understand the situation.As per my knowledge it may take time up to 4 months min,max i dont know.You will get call maximum but i dont know whenso please look outside

how can one improve a credit score by 100 points	which army would win if fights occured between us troops from ww2 and us troops from vietnam war	0	Increasing your credit score by 100 points is not rocket science,i am going to list a few things you can do by improving your credit score and if time is a factor this will get your credit up in 30 days. Sit back and1. Correct any errors on the credit report :Contact creditors that are reporting inaccurate late payments or defaults. Call them by phone and ask to rectify the mistakes. Then follow up with a letter making the same request and notify all three credit reporting bureaus of the pending changes.Make sure creditors know the bureaus have been notified. It may motivate them to act quickly.2. Raise your available credit :Requesting a higher credit limit from an already-established creditor may also help boost the borrower’s available credit line. This in turn could help elevate a credit score.3. Negotiate :A defaulted credit card bill can leave a serious blemish on a credit report. However, it does not have to remain there forever. Consumers can ask creditors to accept partial payment for a debt in collections in return for reclassifying the debt as “paid.” A creditor may agree to settle for a partial payment, or they may make a counter offer.4. Hire a professonal :This to me is the best method, it not only saves you the stress,dedication and partial frustation that comes with improving your credit score but you can also improve your credit score points from 100 points to 500 points at once. It is advised that when hiring a professional you should seek a profound and experienced one like myself to avoid any future catastrophe.	I’m Canadian technically, but let’s go with India.Map of the Indian Subcontinent, circa 1782On January 14, 1761, tens of thousands of Marathas march to break the siege at Panipat. Knowing the desperate nature of their struggle, they know they must win.The battle starts. The Marathas fight bravely, but their adversary, the Afghans, right with better tactics. Maratha after Maratha falls, but unlike in our timeline, the Maratha commander issues a retreat order. When the Marathas retreat and regroup, they launch one final attack, capturing an Afghan camp. And tons and tons of food. With more time before they starve, the Maratha commanders send desperate pleas to the Jats and Sikhs to intervene. With no response for the next four days, the Marathas lose hope. They leave the camp for one final fight with the Afghans. However, before both sides can battle each other, in the distance, the Marathas spot thousands of Jat and Sikh troops charging the Afghan lines. Within hours, the Afghans are smited and Abdali runs away, back to Afghanistan. With the Marathas severely weakened, and their Mughal enemies still in Delhi, Jassa Singh Ahluwalia, the leader of the Sikhs, and Suraj Mal, the leader of the Jats, decide to unite their armies, and over the next few days, they steamroll through to Delhi, conquering the Taqt-e-Hind, while the Marathas focus on restoring order. With the now domains of the Sikhs and the Jats now united, they have greater bargaining power over the Marathas, and keep their domains, while the Marathas are stuck with their own weakened Empire. The Marathas retain control over their core land of Maharashtra, the Malwa region (Madhya Pradesh), and Gujarat. Meanwhile, the Sikh-Jat Union gains full control of Eastern Punjab, Delhi, and Haryana. The united armies of the Sikhs, Marathas, and Jats pacify Rajasthan, and it is annexed into the Maratha domains. Over the next year, both unions build their power as Abdali cowers from Peshawar. Then, the Marathas quickly annex the Sindh, while the Sikhs and Jats conquer Western Punjab all the way up till the doorstep of Afghanistan, due to their newfound wealth from Delhi. With the Marathas and Sikhs and Jats occupied with the West, new developments take place in the East. The Zamindars of Oudh, bolstered by the fall of the Mughal Empire, quickly annex all of modern day Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand, establishing the Dominion of Oudh, which is ruled by noble Zamindars. Inspired by the changes throughout the rest of India, in a near-miracle, Southern Indian regions come together, despite their differences, and merge into Dravida, a benevolent oligarchy ruled by the former Kings. Soon, Dravida invades Sri Lanka as well, conquering it. Meanwhile, with most of India united under the Maratha Empire, Dravida, the Punjab Raj (the new union between the Jats and Sikhs), and the Dominion of Awadh, Clive’s Bengal feels the pressure of united front. Soon enough, a revolution occurs in Bengal, lead by the mercantile elite of Bengal. Supported by the Oudhis, who need a friendly state with access to the sea, the British are slowly driven out of Bengal, and Bengal is established as a (semi-flawed) republic dominated by the merchants who eventually lead Bengal to conquer lots of the other areas of India too. Now, this is the map of India circa 1776, when Bengal got its freedom:Blue: The Republic of PunjabPurple: The Maratha FederationGreen: The Republic of BengalGold: The Dominion of Awadh (formerly Oudh)Red: The Dravidian ConfederationEach of these nations, by 1782, turns out to be very different, with quite interesting politics playing out.The Maratha FederationCentred in the city of Pune, a new competent Maratha administration decentralizes the power to an extent. The Marathas, realizing that their idea of religious unity will not necessarily work in the Sindh, decide to secularize, and instead es...

Now, that's what you have to do so you don't look like a big coward about it.As far as your sister goes, never say that you didn't tell her you liked this woman. Own it.
who is the most powerful character in skyrim apart from alduin	who would win the dovahkiin from skyrim or kylo ren	0	Ok, I will tell you right now. It is none other than:All jokes aside, in lore it is definitely Tsun. He can't be killed, and he is the one who chooses who gains entry into the Hall of Valor in Sovngarde.In gameplay, it's this guy:That's right, Master Arngeir. He might not be who you thought of, right? Well, for starters, he is tied with Miraak for being the highest level NPC at level 150. Furthermore, he knows every shout in the game except for Dragonrend and Miraak’s Four word shout. He doesn't use them all, but even then he is near impossible to kill. He has 1292 health(for perspective, Alduin has over 2000 at all levels), and over 1000 stamina, though he doesn't need the green bar. If you fight him at High Hrothgar, you're done. He can use Ice Form and freeze you, and one of his pals will probably use Unrelenting Force and knock you off the edge.If you fight him elsewhere, he can do the same thing, just without assistance.	Well, one is capable of entirely disobeying Newtons Third law, capable of wielding many different types of magic, adept at many skills like stealth, archery, wielding swords, and even has the support of deities. One has a red lightsaber with a hilt, the hilt having (argubly) little effect due to his inexperience*** (Read the P.S).I think i see a new body decorating the walls of Windhelm (or Solitude).Ok now, let's have a few theoretical battles, for fairness. Say these two were pitted against each other in a sword fight, with the Dovahkiin using a Daedric sword and shield, and Kylo using his signature lightsaber. In theory, Ebony would be able to either cut straight through, or entirely block, a lightsaber blade. So, Dovahkiin could block with the shield, and then, using Kylo's hilt to his advantage, trap the sword within the clawlike shapes of the shield, and wrench it from his grasp. Now Kylo has no weapon, against someone very experienced with a sword, currently wielding a Daedric blade.Dovah - 1. Kylo - 0.Ok, how about a magic/thu'um vs force battle.Well, Kylo would probably just choke the Dovahkiin outright, or invade his mind and force him to forfeit. If he could react fast enough, he might be able to begin burning Kylo or something, but probably not.Dovah - 1. Kylo - 1.Ranged vs Lightsaber?Dovahkiin would fire a single ebony arrow, and even if kylo tried to block it, the arrowhead would cut straight through the plasma of the blade and hit him. If he cut the shaft in half, chances are the arrow won't lose enough momentum.Dovah - 2. Kylo - 1.So, from these 3 examples, the chances are that if Dovah has daedric weapons and enough speed to reach him before he is forced to forfeit, he'd win easily.(P.S while it's said on Wookieepedia that Kylo is a good lightsaber user, Ren defeated him, and she doesn't approach the sword skills of Dovah)
can a muslim guy date a non muslim girl is it based on how religious the individual is or are there other factors to it	what do nonmuslims expect from muslims	0	The technical answer is, yes. You are two humans who might make the decision to date each other.The legal answer is, it depends on where you are having the relationship, and whether the laws of that region allow it.The religious answer is, Islam does not condone a romantic relationship between a boy and a girl unless they are husband and wife. However, it depends on how religious he is, as there are moderate Muslims in unmarried relationships of varying degrees of intimacy. The important thing is that you are honest to each other, understand what feels right to each other about the situation, and mutually respect each other's wishes/responsibilities.The societal answer is, it depends on his family, as well as which society your relationship would take place in. If his family's not cool with it because of your different religions, I'd say it's best to keep out and avoid disrespecting them, because as a fellow East Asian I know we don't tend to be big on religion, so you might not enjoy this struggle.Not all Muslims are the same, and your love could be impossible, or it could blossom to the point where you adopt his culture and religion or he might adopt yours. Such is life.	"Home-made biryani. If you have a muslim friend, I'm sure you have said this to her/him umpteen number of times, ""Bhai biryani to khila yaar kabhi. Tere ghar pe to roz hi banti hogi""; i.e. if you are a non-vegetarian. Also, they expect their Muslim friends to invite them for sewai during festivals."
what are your comments on this picture	what can i comment to my girlfriend  pictures	0	"In one word this picture describes our ""Tolerance"".The picture beautifully describes the poor tolerant generation of Indians in our country who were given nothing and fooled by  the generations of a deceptive political party that some how ruled us and threw us deeper in to the manholes of poverty. As an Indian I am deeply hurt when I see this picture.Looking forth the generation that has come all the way out of the mess they have created and seeing its adaptability and its potential I am proud to be a part of this youth circle.With the resources we had we learnt to make things large by undergoing so many tolerant adjustments.Stop calling us ""Intolerant"" as a nation. The word in reality serves no purpose."

how do you prove the heisenberg uncertainty principle experimentally	what  the easiest way to prove the heisenberg uncertainty principle	0	"Easiest, for me, is to use the theorem from advanced calculus, derived by Fourier about 100 years before Heisenberg did his work.  He showed that a superposition of waves could not have both a small size and also a small number of frequencies.  Specifically, he showed that Δ𝑘Δ𝑥≥1/2ΔkΔx≥1/2\Delta k \Delta x \ge 1/2In this equation, k is the ""wavenumber"", or the ""spatial frequency"", equal to 2π/wavelength. I emphasize that this equation is only based on the mathematics of Fourier transforms.  It has nothing to do with quantum mechanics.Now recognize that for the wave function, the momentum of the particle is given by p = (h/2π)k.  So take the Fourier equation, multiply both sides by (h/2π), and you getΔ𝑝Δ𝑥≥ℎ/4πΔpΔx≥h/4π\Delta p \Delta x \ge h/4πSince the wave function is a wave, this equation is an immediate consequence.  This is Heisenberg's uncertainty relationship. Because it is quantum physics, we no longer interpret Δ𝑝Δp\Delta p as a range of spatial frequencies, but as an uncertainty.  That's because the standard (""Copenhagen"") interpretation of quantum mechanics says that a measurement will detect only one of the many waves that compose the pulse. This derivation is not an approximation or a heuristic argument, but a correct derivation, and as a result it gives the exact Heisenberg relationship.  Of course, in order to understand it, you have to understand the properties of waves, and that was worked out by Fourier.  There are other ""heuristic"" ways to see the relationship.  Some of these refer to the fact that measurement ""must disturb"" the particle.  In fact, the only assumption that you need to make in modern quantum physics is that a measurement causes the wave function to ""collapse"", meaning that only one of its many components will be detected."	How do we know that the Heisenberg uncertainty principle is distinct from the observer effect? How could we possibly be sure that our measurements aren't somehow messing things up?
what is the ielts all about	what is ielts and its use	1	Hi,The International English Language Testing System (IELTS) measures the language proficiency of people who want to study or work where English is used as a language of communication. It uses a nine-band scale to clearly identify levels of proficiency, from non-user (band score 1) through to expert (band score 9).IELTS Academic or IELTS General TrainingIELTS is available in two test versions: Academic - for people applying for higher education or professional registration, and General Training for those migrating to Australia, Canada and the UK, or applying for secondary education, training programmes and work experience in an English-speaking environment. Both versions provide a valid and accurate assessment of the four language skills: listening, reading, writing and speaking.Test formatTwo formats of IELTS test are avialable –a) IELTS AcademicThe Academic module is designed for candidates who seek to acquire education at undergraduate or postgraduate levels, and for those who want to go abroad for professional registration.b) IELTS GeneralThe General Training format is for those who wish to migrate to English-speaking countries for secondary education, work experience or training programs. People migrating to Australia, Canada and New Zealand must take the General Training test.Note: certain professions require an Academic test result for registration and migration purposes.Each recognizing organization sets its own entry requirements. In some cases both modules may be accepted. One must contact the organization you are applying to in order to check their requirements.Both modules cover all four language skills listening, reading, writing and speaking.Everyone takes the same Listening and Speaking tests.There are different Reading and Writing tests for the Academic and General Training modules.The Listening, Reading and Writing tests must be completed on the same day. There are no breaks between the three written tests.The Speaking test may be taken up to seven days before or after the test.When can I take IELTS?IELTS is available on 48 fixed dates a year – up to four times a month,depending on local demand. Check all the test dates for the year or go to your nearest centre to see its next test date.StructureIELTS has two versions of tests, namely –AcademicGeneralboth the versions have 4 sections : Reading, Writing, Speaking & Listening. The Speaking & Listening sections remains the same in both the versions, but the Reading & Writings sections of the Academic version are slightly tougher than the similar sections in General version of the test.All candidates must complete four Modules – Listening, Reading, Writing and Speaking to obtain an IELTS Test Report Form. The Listening, Reading and Writing modules must be completed in one day. The Speaking module may be taken, at the discretion of the test centre, in the period seven days before or after the other modules.The typical structure of IELTS test is :-Listening (30 minutes)Timing: Approximately 30 minutes (plus 10 minutes’ transfer time)Questions: 40Test Parts: 4 sectionsSection 1 is a conversation between two people set in an everyday social contextSection 2 is a monologue set in an everyday social context (e.g. a speech about local facilities or a talk about the arrangements for meals during a conference)Section 3 is a conversation between up to four people set in an educational or training context (e.g. a university tutor and a student discussing an assignment, or a group of students planning a research project)Section 4 is a monologue on an academic subject (e.g. a university lecture)Each section is heard once onlyA variety of voices and native-speaker accents is used.Skills assessed: The listening section assesses a variety of skills which enables the judgement of the candidate on grounds of their understanding of the basic factual information delivered b...	According to IELTS Home of the English Language Test: “IELTS is the high-stakes English test for study, migration or work”. The test is an examination of your ability to communicate effectively in English Language when applying to study, work, or immigrate to the UK, Canada, Australia and New Zealand. It is also acceptable in many other countries.There are two types IELTS tests:IELTS Academic for those planning to study in English at tertiary level or professional certifications.IELTS General Training for those moving to work, study at secondary level, attend training programmes or for immigration.Regardless of the type, candidates are generally tested under four major communication modes:Listening: examines how well and how fast you can comprehend day-to-day verbal communication in diverse settings (e.g. talking to a customer care officer on phone, discussion among students, academic lectures, briefings at a museum etc.). You listen to a recorded audio without repeat and you record your responses in provided answer sheets.Reading: here you are tested on ho well you comprehend written text from regular publications (e.g. news articles, educational articles, guides/manuals, etc). You have to read a number of passages, adverts, or manuals and answer questions about them in a booklet.Speaking: Here you need to demonstrate your ability to hold a conversation in English comfortably even at increasing difficulty. You will speak one-on-one with an examiner who will ask you a variety of questions starting from introducing yourself, family, work or educational background etc., to more complicated topics bothering current global issues, or abstract topics. Your speech is recorded during the test.Writing: Here you demonstrate your ability to communicate effectively in written English in both formal and informal settings. First you are asked to write a letter (formal or informal) and then, in the second part, you are required to write an essay such as an argumentative essay on a given topic. For example, you may be asked to write a friend to ask about the nature of a city you’re planning to relocate to in the first question or asked to explain your position about an issue such as “Traditionally, people think the concept of family applies to the conventional setting of a man (father), a woman (mother) and children while in today’s society some think the family should be broadened to include non-conventional settings of a man (woman), a man (woman) and children”.Candidates can earn maximum of 9 points per section. The final score is aggregated over the four sections and normalised to 9 points. This is then graded according to the IELTS scale.In general, there is no fail and pass score, it depends on the requirement of the organisation or purpose for which the test is taken. However, the higher your score the better.
how do i lose weight without doing any sport	how do i lose weight without doing exercise or diet	1	With ease as losing weight has zero to do with exercise. It’s all about nutrition.Firstly here is what not to do!Follow any advice that suggests consuming less calories than you burn. Although this sounds logical it ignores how the body works and sadly ignores every meaningful, large study over years.The very best study ever done on caloric reduction as a path to lasting weight loss showed that it failed. The Women’s Health Initiative, a gigantic randomized controlled trial,followed almost 50,000 womenover seven and a half years.One group of the women followed a low-fat, low-calorie diet high in grains, fruits, and vegetables and reduced their total daily calories by 361 calories. They also increased their amount of exercise by 14 percent.The other group followed their usual diet.The first group was expected to show weight loss. The other group was not expected to see any weight loss.The final results were a complete shock to everybody involved.The actual difference in weight loss between the two groups was not even two pounds!Worse still, the average waist size in the low-calorie, increased-exercise group grew from 35 to 35.4 inches. These 25,000 women who so carefully followed the “eat less, move more” strategy for so long actually ended up fatter than ever. Source :Dr Jason FungSuper hard workouts or intense cardio type suggestions! Don’t follow for weightlossworking out is for fitness, function and health.The most famous study on exercise followed 13,000 runners over decades. Complied by RUNNERS WORLD, these runners were highly active. The results of miles and miles of running? All 13,000 were fatter after every decade!(I have plenty of big studies that prove both, again please don’t quote back small studies, with selected people, over short durations; they don’t stand up to scrutiny)So if;eating less moving more is not the answer,calorie deficit is not the answer,insane amounts of cardio is not the answer.WHAT IS THE ANSWER?When I say not the answer, I mean long term, permanent weightloss. Please don’t quote studies that have less than 100 people, over less than a year. They are meaningless studies and often funded by food or drink companies.So to get rid of fat; it’s all down to understanding one thing.How the body stores or burns fat.This process is controlled by two hormones (insulin and glucagon) that work like scales. Too much insulin and you’ll store fat, no insulin and glucagon can do it’s job and burn fat.The proof that hormones control fat storing and burning is common knowledge in the medical world and is not controversial.

With ease as losing weight has zero to do with exercise. It’s all about nutrition.Firstly here is what not to do!Follow any advice that suggests consuming less calories than you burn. Although this sounds logical it ignores how the body works and sadly ignores every meaningful, large study over years.The very best study ever done on caloric reduction as a path to lasting weight loss showed that it failed. The Women’s Health Initiative, a gigantic randomized controlled trial,followed almost 50,000 womenover seven and a half years.One group of the women followed a low-fat, low-calorie diet high in grains, fruits, and vegetables and reduced their total daily calories by 361 calories. They also increased their amount of exercise by 14 percent.The other group followed their usual diet.The first group was expected to show weight loss. The other group was not expected to see any weight loss.The final results were a complete shock to everybody involved.The actual difference in weight loss between the two groups was not even two pounds!Worse still, the average waist size in the low-calorie, increased-exercise group grew from 35 to 35.4 inches. These 25,000 women who so carefully followed the “eat less, move more” strategy for so long actually ended up fatter than ever. Source :Dr Jason FungSuper hard workouts or intense cardio type suggestions! Don’t follow for weightlossworking out is for fitness, function and health.The most famous study on exercise followed 13,000 runners over decades. Complied by RUNNERS WORLD, these runners were highly active. The results of miles and miles of running? All 13,000 were fatter after every decade!(I have plenty of big studies that prove both, again please don’t quote back small studies, with selected people, over short durations; they don’t stand up to scrutiny)So if;eating less moving more is not the answer,calorie deficit is not the answer,insane amounts of cardio is not the answer.WHAT IS THE ANSWER?When I say not the answer, I mean long term, permanent weightloss. Please don’t quote studies that have less than 100 people, over less than a year. They are meaningless studies and often funded by food or drink companies.So to get rid of fat; it’s all down to understanding one thing.How the body stores or burns fat.This process is controlled by two hormones (insulin and glucagon) that work like scales. Too much insulin and you’ll store fat, no insulin and glucagon can do it’s job and burn fat.The proof that hormones control fat storing and burning is common knowledge in the medical world and is not controversial. Yes there are hormones that control hunger and feeling full but in the end it’s all about being a fat burner or sugar burner.Don’t eat refined carbohydrates, sugars and fructoseYes without a doubt that’s all you need to do.

why do digital cameras have shutter sound	what digital cameras have electronic shutter that can be set to make absolutely no sound or noise	1	Since I got into digital 10 years ago I have been a fan of compacts, for lots of reasons, but one thing I really like is being able to turn off all sounds, including the “shutter.” Compacts (so far as I know) don't actually have shutters; they expose the sensor electronically, which is why your live view blanks out for the fraction of a second that the “shutter” is “firing.” My latest camera is an upgrade from a Nikon P7800. I bought a gently used Sony RX-10 and I am nuts about it. One reason why is, like my previous compacts, I can shut off all sounds; no beeps, no clicks, no nuthin'. Stealth shooting. I love to shoot in museums but I don't like to attract attention (just shy). No shutter sound lets me work quietly making natural family candids. The whoooosh-thunk of a DSLR mirror and shutter are real attention getters, exactly what I don't want. I find that with the camera mashed to my face I can still hear a little whisper click when it “fires,” and of course the electronic viewfinder blacks out. There's no reason to worry that you can't tell if it's firing.I got the .pdf of the RX-100 III and found on page 27, in the setup menu, a reference to audio signals, setting the operating sounds. That should be where you can go in and turn off all the sounds, including the “shutter.”	Since I got into digital 10 years ago I have been a fan of compacts, for lots of reasons, but one thing I really like is being able to turn off all sounds, including the “shutter.” Compacts (so far as I know) don't actually have shutters; they expose the sensor electronically, which is why your live view blanks out for the fraction of a second that the “shutter” is “firing.” My latest camera is an upgrade from a Nikon P7800.

what  it like dating a gangster	i am 51 can i date a man in his 30 	0	I kinda enjoy it, I went to the supermarket the other day and when I got back two guys come and unpacked my car. I don’t even have to lock my stuff up cause nobody would even try steal anything.I just started dating a VP of a gang and I know theirs the typical guy stuff with the way he acts but as far as how gang life will affect your relationship,He is always busy, always walking out the door even though he doesn’t have a 9–5. You need to be ok with his business coming first. I don’t even want to know what he does so I don’t ask at all because it comes with the territory.Learn to keep busy because you will be alone a lot.Always dress nice for him, men like that love to show off their girl you always have to be extra and they don’t mind paying for it.He will always have girls trying to get at him and they love the attention. Females know they have money so they will be hitting him up all the time, you need to be so straight up it ain’t funny. First time I met him I told him if it’s me it’s no one else, and I just ask him straight out who she, who’s that don’t sit around but and assume shit or you will get nowhere with them BUT reign it in don’t throw some massive fit just let them know you don’t like it and they better cut that bitch off then drop it.He has a lot of money so you never pay for much besides little things that you want.His ex will never be out of his life if they have children. I made sure to let him know that I know my place with the ex and don’t involve yourself at all with that problem unless she’s trying to get at him. They have a weird sense of loyalty when it comes to the mother of their children.You need to love his children like your own from day 1. No questions asked.You feel safer than you ever will in your life even though you’re probably in more danger to a certain extent.Expect to be judged by everyone.I would never be with just a nobody in a gang (shallow I know) the benefits have to outweigh the bad or it’s pointless.	If you both love each other then why not? No one should judge two legal adults on their own private business, and no one should force you apart from the person you love as long as it is consensual, not harming society and is in accordance with the laws of your nation. You two are both well over the age of 18, are both experienced in pretty much all your early lives and are at an age where you should be settling down. Go for it!
what were the main and most important political causes of world war 1	what were the causes for world war 1	1	"I believe Captain Blackadder put it best.Baldrick: The thing is: The way I see it, these days there's a war on, right? and, ages ago, there wasn't a war on, right? So, there must have been a moment when there not being a war on went away, right? and there being a war on came along. So, what I want to know is: How did we get from the one case of affairs to the other case of affairs?Edmund: Do you mean ""Why did the war start?""Baldrick: Yeah.George: The war started because of the vile Hun and his villainous empire-building.Edmund: George, the British Empire at present covers a quarter of the globe, while the German Empire consists of a small sausage factory in Tanganyika. I hardly think that we can be entirely absolved of blame on the imperialistic front.George: Oh, no, sir, absolutely not. [aside, to Baldick] Mad as a bicycle!Baldrick: I heard that it started when a bloke called Archie Duke shot an ostrich 'cause he was hungry.Edmund: I think you mean it started when the Archduke of Austro-Hungary got shot.Baldrick: Nah, there was definitely an ostrich involved, sir.Edmund: Well, possibly. But the real reason for the whole thing was that it was too much effort not to have a war.George: By Golly, this is interesting; I always loved history...Edmund: You see, Baldrick, in order to prevent war in Europe, two superblocs developed: us, the French and the Russians on one side, and the Germans and Austro-Hungary on the other. The idea was to have two vast opposing armies, each acting as the other's deterrent. That way there could never be a war.Baldrick: But this is a sort of a war, isn't it, sir?Edmund: Yes, that's right. You see, there was a tiny flaw in the plan.George: What was that, sir?Edmund: It was bollocks.Baldrick: So the poor old ostrich died for nothing.Ok, fine, this simplifies things just a tad. But it’s more accurate than it should be. We can add to this an insane level of Serbian nationalism that held that Serbs were the best and brightest in the world, and they’d easily beat Austria-Hungary in any war. This is rather like an ant who believes it could defeat the elephant, when the reality is that the elephant could step on it without knowing.The entangled alliances made things worse. The Serbs struck out at AH through their agents in the Black Hand (possibly the best terrorist group name ever), AH responded with a series of ultimata. Serbia accepted most, but wanted time to sort out a couple of them, but Austria-Hungary wasn’t having that, and attacked. Serbia went crying to their big brother, Russia, who then got involved, which forced Germany to join in on Austria’s side, which required France to join in on Russia’s side, and then Germany violated Belgian neutrality, which forced the UK to enter alongside the French and Russians. Soon the Ottomans were joining Germany and Austria (which is slightly ironic on a historical level), and Italy threw in on the side of the allies.Here’s the fun part: pretty much everyone thought the war would be over quickly. They all figured, in their own way, that they’d go give Johnny Foreigner a good thrashing and be home in time for Christmas. They all assumed that God was on their side, and they’d win easily, and topple the enemy.So Serbian nationalism, mixed in with entangling alliances, and extreme overconfidence and arrogance on the part of every power involved, all combined in the most toxic way imaginable, and just like that a whole continent was burning. And once the shooting began, almost everyone succumbed to a version of the Sunk-Cost Fallacy; “if we stop fighting now, then all our boys would have died for nothing!”There are so many chances for this war to have been prevented.Serbia could have accepted the ultimatum and put up with the Austrians causing havoc for a few days until their honor was satisfied.Russia could have found a way to mobilize only against Austria, and not against Germany as well.The UK and France could have made it clear that they weren’t going to get involved.Germany could have honored Belgian neutrality, thus avoiding the first steps at getting America into the war.But alas, once the guns of August began to fire, there was no stopping it. Millions died to no good cause, governments around Europe toppled, Communism took over in Russia, and the stage was set for the even more horrible sequel.Such a horrible, tragic waste."

how do i get over the fear of everything	how do i get over my fears	0	My life is filled with failures.Campus placements- Was rejected in the first round of HCL (Profile - technical support) Package 2.4 LPA but managed to get selected in the next 6 consecutive companies,first company being NTT Data (Profile- Software developer Grade 4) and last company being IUTS( Profile - Technical and Aptitude trainer) Package 10.8 LPAAcademics - Scored 48% in first year of engineering and failed in few subjects but managed to score 70% distinction in my final year.Fitness - Was obese during my engineering days ( Height - 5.8, Weight 95 kgs) so hardly had the courage to participate in any sports events. Now managed to win 1st place in badminton competition conducted in my club.Stage fear- Was timid and failed to address my class of 50 people. Managed to win 1st place in debate competition conducted in college, hosted college alumni function addressing 500+ audience.Java - Scored 35 on 100 during engineering (exempted) but managed to score 95% in Oracle certified Java programmer (OCJP) exam.Maths- Failed miserably many a times in Maths but now managed to crack few competitive exams (Afcat, CDS,CAF’s, RBI, Amcat (99.99%)) and got selected as an Aptitude trainerHow do you overcome the fear of failure?Face it , experience it and master the art to rise above it.Bottom lineI have failed many a times but every time my mind failed accepting it .	To get over your Fear of driving. Take a pen and paper.Write down why you are afraid of driving, just brainstorm. Use short sentences and write them below each other.For example:I fear driving because I am afraid to create an accidentI fear driving because I am afraid to hurt myself in a car accidentI fear driving because I don’t feel confidentI fear driving because I can’t concentrate well enough, etc.Realize with the statements you made why you are afraid of driving, that all these are your thoughts about driving.Now, A fear is just an expectation that something negative is going to happen in the future. Fear doesn't really exist on the moment in which you live. It is important to know that your negative thoughts, create your negative emotion like fear.Take another paper and write here the opposite thoughts of someone who is not afraid of driving. Add even extra positive recommendations if you can find them.For example:I like driving, because it brings me from one place to another.I like driving, because I have my license and I can drive.I will take a few seconds longer every time I drive to watch, to make sure it is alright.I am confident that I can control the situation in the car at all times.I will have to trust myself and when I have doubt, I will slow down, but safely.I will start for a moment to drive on a parking lot, to gain my confidence again. There is all the space and I can experience driving without problems.When I return afterwards into a small area and try driving there and gain more confidence.Than I will drive every where, step by step, control my actions and believe I can drive easily and enjoy the fun of driving. etc.Above you found for example the positive thoughts someone has, when he or she is not afraid.NOW, the problem, you think negative thoughts, what create negative emotions like fear and even less confidence.How do we change it that you really believe the positive thoughts you have created?You have to know that your brain works with synapses to learn something. That means if you repeat something long enough you create a connection between subjects.For example.A little baby is hungry, feels bad in stomach, starts to cry, mother comes with food.Next, time it happens again, after a while. The baby has that bad feeling again, and has learned to cry because than the feeling will go away. The synapses in your brain makes connection between - hunger - bad feeling - cry - mother - food. Later the child knows hungry - cry - food. Later again hungry I will get some food. That is also how you learn history. You connect a date with a happening, repeat it over and over again, than you remember it and it BECOMES YOUR BELIEVE. YOUR PERSPECTIVE.In your case, you have made a list of positive thoughts not to be fearful of driving again, our positive thoughts. Read them over and over again, slowly intensively and again and again. Never talk or tell someone you are afraid of driving. Just repeat in conversations, you are not afraid. If you keep doing this, you program your mind to believe the positive thoughts you want to believe. This is scientific proven, and very simple explained.The nicest thing is that it works, for all fears in live and for all negative emotions you have in life. Just try it and see that it works. Than you will know it is the truth.Don’t forget your personality is not who you are, but WHAT you think.Good luck. More questions, let me know.Thomas Francisco Pelgero.

what is the difference between hdd and ssd in layman  terms	what is differences between ssd and hdd	1	The standard hard disk drive (HDD) has been the predominant storage device for desktop computers and laptops for a long time. But now, with the invention of solid state drive (SSD) technology, computer buyers and users now have access to the latest innovation that’s setting new trends in the storage market. So which one should you go for – the HDD or SSD? Read on to find out.What is an HDD?A hard disk drive (HDD) is basically a storage device in a computer. It is comprised of metal platters with magnetic coating, spindle, and various moving parts to process and store data. The common size for laptop hard drives in the 2.5” model, while a larger 3.5” model is usually found in desktop computers.What is an SSD?A solid state drive (SSD) is also another type of data storage that performs the same job as an HDD. But insteading of storing data in a magnetic coating on top of platters, an SSD uses flash memory chips and an embedded processor to store, retrieve, and cache data. It is roughly about the same size as a typical HDD, and bears the resemblance of what smartphone batteries would look like.HDD and SSD ComparisonNow let’s take a closer look at the two devices. We break it down into the following main categories:SpeedThis is where SSDs truly prevail. While HDDs need a long time to access data and files because the disk must spin to find it, SSDs are up to 100 times faster since data can be accessed instantly. This is why an SSD-equipped PC will boot within seconds and deliver blazing fast speed for launching programs and applications, whereas a computer that uses a HDD will take much longer time to boot the operating system, and will continue to perform slower than an SSD during normal use.CapacityAs of writing, SSD units top out at 16TB storage capacity. Although there are large SSDs, anything that’s over 512GB is beyond most people’s price range. HDDs, on the other hand, have large capacities (1-2TB) available for much more affordable prices.DurabilityHDDs consist of various moving parts and components, making them susceptible to shock and damage. The longer you use your HDD, the more they wear down and most eventually end up failing. Meanwhile, an SSD uses a non-mechanical design of flash storage mounted on a circuit board, providing better performance and reliability, and making it more likely to keep your files and data safe.NoiseAn HDD can sometimes be the loudest part of your computer. Even the highest-performing HDDs will emit some noise when the drive is spinning back and forth to process data. SSDs have no moving parts, meaning it makes no noise at all.HeatMore moving part means more heat, and HDD users will have to live with the fact that their device will degenerate over time. SSD uses flash memory, generating less heat, helping to increase its lifespan.CostTo be frank, SSDs are much more expensive than HDDs for the same capacity. This is why most computers with an SSD only have a few hundred gigabytes of storage. HDDs are about twice as cheaper than SSDs.Despite the high costs and low capacity, SSD is a clear winner over the HDD in terms of performance. While you’re paying more for less memory with an SSD, you’re investing in a faster and far more durable data storage option in the long run.We recommend using an SSD as the primary storage for your operating system, applications, and most-used programs. You can install another HDD inside the same computer to store documents, movies, music, and pictures – these files don’t need to leverage the incredible access times and speed of SSD.Looking to invest in some new hardware for your business?

does my life hold any significance to the worlduniverse	do we truly have any purpose in life or do we create a purpose to make ourselves feel significant in the very vast world or to make ourselves feel that our existence in the vast world is required	0	Great question! Firstly, we should probably identify a few issues that this question involves, the first being the issue of scale. In the case of this question, you’re asking about the significance of your life in relation to two extremely different scale sets (world vs. universe). The other qualifier that makes this question a tough one to answer is simply the definition of significance. Finally, your life also can have several meanings, from the bacterial frameworks in your cellular composition to the other people that are a part of your life, and therefore directly impacted by you.Instead of getting into an argument with myself about semantics, let’s focus on scales for a second, and what “significance” inside of those scales mean. I’ll use wavelengths and their frequencies for this little metaphor: the visible scale takes up less than a quarter of a quarter of a quarter of a fraction of the known or “useful” scale of wavelengths. Wavelengths of energy can range from the incredibly small (visible light only encompasses 310 nm - from 390–700nm - of the electromagnetic spectrum) to massive (planet or star sized wavelengths). So if the tiniest portions of this infinite scale can encompass everything from microwaves, to gamma rays, to the the visible light that is responsible for life itself, then we can state that the very small can be very significant . . . to us. On the scale that we live on: you are significant. On the bigger scale, nothing matters or is significant except the beginning and the end - and we question that those are even things.Because of the way this question is phrased, there can be no answer that isn’t philosophical (the question implies a basic philosophical conundrum), but allow me to take a blind stab at it! Yes. Yes, we hold an intrinsic value to the Universe and the World simply by being alive, self-aware, and curious. The reason we hold a higher value than even light is because of the isolation of our occurrence and the projection that we are rare. Being rare is one of the few things that makes an item, a type, or even life valuable.Will your passage from life to death be noted? Yes. By the life inside of your body and by the life around you. Will the non-conscious portions of the universe give a crap? No, but then, how much do you really care about that? To make a physics pun and drop mic: you matter.I cut this portion out: Light cannot see itself, nor shows any effective consciousness, and therefore should not have an identification of significance to itself. It is significant to us, but how significant it is in the universe at large, especially compared to the non-visible spectrum, is unknown. Our impact on the universe is unknown, because the universe does not make it a habit to give us reports on our effectiveness.	"Case 1: You have a purpose in life.1. You can expect that some messenger will deliver you a letter stating your purpose and then you will work towards it. The time of you receiving the ""statement of your purpose"" depends on the task assigned to you then, but since I have not heard of stuff like this I feel safe to reject this notion.2. You keep living your life as of now and when you stumble upon your purpose, you live to fulfill that. Case 2: You have no purpose in lifeYou keep living your life and try being happy and make yourself feel ""significant"".What I am trying to say is that you have to live your life in any case, you cant just sit on your hands saying that we don't have a purpose in life and that you are not significant. Make the most of your time till you realize what you got to do that floats your boat."
how is the job situation in new zealand for computer science graduates	how is the job situation in new zealand for computer science graduates diploma	1	I routinely hire new immigrants with solid java/j2ee development experience in Auckland.

what are some tips for someone trying to teach themselves to sing	how can i teach myself how to sing	1	As someone who has fronted a band as a lead singer and knows very little about professional singing - I can agree with the consensus above that there is probably no substitute for a great coach. However - since you seem to be interested in doing it yourself - I think there are still a few things you can do to make yourself a lot better than you already are. Quick and dirty:1. PRACTICE. I can't emphasize this enough. Your singing voice is like a muscle that gets soft and mushy if you don't exercise it. You don't have to sing scales. I used to get tons of practice driving alone and singing at the very top of my lungs along with the radio or pre-recorded tunes -  with the windows rolled up. Please keep the windows rolled up. :)2. Practice breathing from your diaphragm. This might take a little work if you haven't done it before. One way to do this is to lie down on your back and place a book on your stomach. Practice taking deep breaths that fill up your belly and not just shallow lung filling breaths. The book should rise and fall - if it doesn't move, you aren't doing it right. Once you have that down - practice taking diaphragm breaths while singing and see how much more power your voice has.3. Try to be aware of your natural range, and where your voice crosses into a falsetto. Many people tend to sound nasally and flat when they hit higher notes because they are not opening up the back of their throat enough. Try singing some scales and when you cross into a higher range focus on creating space at the back of your soft palate by contracting it up like you are trying to hold a golf ball at the back of your tongue without swallowing it. ( sounds uncomforatble i know, but sometimes having a visual can help you do something that sounds or feels unnatural at first). Opening you mouth wider will also help with the nasally part.4. Over-enunciate. It will feel ridiculous - but it will sound better.These things won't make you a professional - but they will take you further than you think. As Sara mentioned it is also really instructive to record yourself so you can get a better idea of where you are experiencing trouble. I almost never know if something is a good take or not until I hear it played back. Most importantly, remember singing is fun, so try not take yourself too seriously - unless of course, you do -in which case you should probably take that lesson :).

if climate change scientists are right why do they worry so much about public relations and packaging	what kinds of rude comments will a man get in  america  if he dates a woman 30 years younger than him	0	They don't.In a way that was their problem. They were too busy doing science, and didn't feel they also needed to sell a glossy package to the public. Also, they were scientists, not PR professionals. They felt if they did their studies and presented their data and results, they were done - others would take it from there.But the resistance to their results, originally by oil companies, DID focus on PR. They lobbied Congress, paid their think tanks to come up with denialist language, had handsome spokespeople dismiss the scientific results.Meanwhile, Exxon was doing it's own research on global warming, and reaching the same conclusions as the scientists. They just kept it secret for a long time, while outwardly talking and paying for the denialist rhetoric. But that’s another story..In recent years, scientific organizations have tried to be better at PR. Once in a while you see a TV episode from National Geographic say, or efforts by philanthropists like Al Gore. But all their work is NOTHING compared to the full-on and multi-pronged campaigns by business interests.Just the fact that you asked the question like this, mentioning the scientists’ PR efforts but completely omitting the fossile fuel efforts (which are thousands times more money spent). It means you've bought some of the denialist rhetoric and have been “educated” to focus blame on the wrong side.	“Cradle robbing Jared Fogle looking underage-daughterfucker.”“How old was she when you met, dude?”“What was your one year anniversary gift to her, a pacifier?”“Hey, were you a priest, by chance?”“Is she with you for your money or are you with her for her looks?”“If it bleeds, it breeds, amirite? I’m calling CPS.”“How’s your child bride, Sandusky?”“I guess it makes sense. She’s not allowed to be out past eight, and that’s about the time you turn in for the night. Problem solves itself!”“How much was her postage?”I could go on. It’s creepy. What could you possibly have in common with a girl young enough to be your daughter?

what is the main reason for all the problems in india	if frances farmer the actress was still around today what would she think about donald trump	0	We people are not striving for change. We allowed only one government to rule us so long. Now also government is requesting for swachcha bharat abhiyan, contribution from people is nowhere.Corruption is everywhere but people who are asking for bribe are people only but don't want to change.so many rapes are happening but parents are not teaching values to respect woman.Education system all people knows that they should not compare talent based on marks but still today it is continued.All people knows child's are getting over burdened because of education level, still they are sending them to additional private coaching classes.People don't want to change set tradition, so problems are getting multiplied over period of time.	Hello all.First of all, comparing Mr T to any of Ms Rand’s outspoken heroes is a bit of masking the man. Any of the heroes that Rand created spoke from integrity, not from personal self-aggrandizement. Mr T seems to lack the integrity necessary to have earned the right to say what he thinks and be respected by it, that is clear because he DOES say what he thinks and it is often pretty embarrassing, if not downright shameful.Another aspect that should be highlighted is the “want” vs. “need” theme Rand proposed in “Atlas”. That is, (simplifying horribly!), wanting something becomes the motivation behind going out and doing something in order to get something. Needing something implies that one need not do anything, they are entitled to it simply because they feel they need it…. which in “Atlas” was manifested by the whiny attitudes of the scum-bag characters that robbed steel and energy and finally shut down the country.And it is the “feel” part of need that is concerning here. I’ve seen over and over again in interviews with public figures that seem to support Mr T that feeling trumps fact. Some have even gone so far as to assert that feeling that something is true is tantamount to it actually being true, despite evidence to the contrary. So, people feel that Obama has not done a good job as president, must be true. They feel that immigration is a threat to the American way of life, must be true. They feel (or read “fear”) that terrorism is the number one issue to be dealt with, must be true.It is upon those “feelings” that Mr T is raking in the support and votes. He does not deal in facts, he deals in feelings, takes advantage of those feelings and makes empty promises to make those bad feelings go away— he will make America great again (which seems to imply that it is no longer great, and was it ever?).This manipulation of reality and voters through addressing the feeling of need would probably ruffle Ms Rand’s fur a bit, I think. She might find him interesting as a caricature of a business man (for he is nothing more that a caricature), but I doubt she would equate him with Galt, or any of Galt’s chosen ones.
what is a good substitute for milk in macaroni and cheese	what are some good cheese substitutes for havarti cheese	0	I came here for answers to my quest (neighborhood full of hungry kids, playing on slip n slide and we all agree to cheap Mac n cheese when I go to mix in milk and… None Was there!)i opened my cabinets to search for condensed milk or soy or even considered pudding when I finally settled on my best bet: ranch dressing. I went to shut the fridge door when i saw the CREAM CHEESE. I am now writing to say I made my best Mac n cheese, yet! Ultimately I still added the full amount of water in place of milk but also added 5oz of cream cheese (double box) and it is amazing! My picky eater just asked for seconds (the only kid that wasn't hungry!)I’m off to make another creamy batch with cream cheese. Good luck to all the desperate parents enduring this same quest for answers ;)	If this is about mac and cheese, gruyere is kind of the king of melted cheese foods. It melts evenly and doesn't completely turn into grease. It's not as creamy as havarti and is definitely more cheesy tasting, but still pretty mild for a semi-hard cheese. For flavor comparable to havarti, maybe a super mild cheddar or Gouda or, honestly, a white American cheese could fit the bill as long as whomever you're cooking for isn't too snobby to eat American cheese.

At best is temporarily masks the problem. The whole thing can be frustrating as hell and reduced me to tears more than once.If you haven’t seen it already Vertigo Professor has a bunch of videos on Vertigo and this speciifcally is worth a look: How to (Properly) Overcome Vertigo and Dizziness (and Why Masking the Problem is Stupid)	If you are not taking adequate fluids and nutrients you may have electrolyte problems and constipation. In this case your heart may not work well and you may get dizzy.If your blood flow to your gut is not good or there are other inflammatory issues in the bowel causing blood loss you may get dizzy. If you are not moving around you may get constipated and you may get dizzy when you stand suddenly due to postural hypotension, but the constipation is not causing the dizziness.Of course some people have died or passed out when they have made a vagal maneuver trying to push out a hard stool. But that is a nerve stimulation that causes that issue.
is it possible to make doctor  review app using which patients can share anonymously all treatment given by that doctor suggested medicines	what is the warranty period of the mi inear headphones pro	0	"Thanks for the A2A Surabhi.I'm outside the US and so can offer a slightly different perspective from the other commentators.The answer to your question is yes: it's perfectly possible for patients to post reviews of their doctors, their hospitals, and so on. In the UK for a while there were plans to publish ""league tables"" of surgeons, so that patients could see who got the best outcomes. While all of these are very seductive, there are loads of reasons why I am deeply sceptical about them.Let's take the league table first. Let's make it simple: we have two surgeons, Dr A and Dr B, who each do the same operations, coronary bypass surgery. Dr A has a 2% 30-day mortality, while Dr B has a 10% 30-day mortality. To the lay person, Dr A is clearly the better doctor, right? You wouldn't want that clumsy butcher Dr B operating on you.But behind the scenes, Dr A cherry-picks only the easiest ops on the fittest patients. He turns down many patients because he thinks they are too risky: they might hurt his numbers. Meanwhile, Dr B picks up Dr A's rejects. He's a bit more courageous. He says to his patients: sure, you're not in great shape, but without the surgery you will be worse off. He might even be more technically skilled than Dr A. And the 90% of his patients who survive think he is a miracle worker. Dr B cares about looking after his patients and not what some number says about his skills or his care.Let's consider two patients, Mr X and Mr Y. Each needs a heart bypass operation. X goes to visit Dr A. X is in pretty good shape, A does the op, everything looks rosy, and X writes A a glowing review.Y goes to see Dr A. Y is unfortunately overweight, diabetic and a smoker. Mr A tells Y that the operation is too risky. That he will need to stop smoking, get his sugar under control and lose a bit of weight before he will consider operating on him. This is good medical practice. Meanwhile Y is fed up being lectured to by doctors about his weight. He loves his pies and his fags. So he writes a nasty review of A.My point about this last one bears repeating more clearly. Sometimes, for the very best reasons, doctors cannot give patients what they want. Sometimes patients' expectations are unrealistic. Sometimes a doctor's treatments are limited. None of this makes them a bad doctor.Let me be clear on one final point: there are bad doctors. Only a few, mind, but they are out there. But the clumsy tools of league tables or patient reviews are hopeless at identifying them."

This sort of build quality is unheard of at this price point.And yes, we attempted treading on the MA-350 -- they survived.The RHA MA-350 earphones utilize a fabric-covered cable. This is an effort to decrease tangling, but in our experience cloth wires have a tendency to tangle quite as much as their plastic/rubber counterparts.

what are the best films that take place in one room	i want to get thrilled which movie should i watch	0	"Looking for some thrillers that take place entirely in a single enclosed space? Here are 13 best:Devil: M. Night takes the producer chair in this horror flick about a literal elevator ride from hell, where a group of strangers realize they are trapped in an elevator with the devil! After the abysmal ratings following the bloated Last Airbender, it was sure good to see M. Night back in the creative environment he's best suited- involved in a little indie with a big concept.The Killing Room: Back in the 50s and 60s, the American government conducted a rash of freaky experiments on unsuspecting citizens. The code name for the covert CIA mind-control and chemical research program was called MK-ULTRA, and basically it was like an evil version of the Dharma Initiative.The Killing Room works under the premise that the program was never shut down and people are still being tricked into participating in said freaky experiments in the name of national security. One of the things that makes The Killing Room stand out, is you get to see on both sides of the experiment. Another reason to check it out is that it's from World Battle: Los Angeles director Jonathan Liebesman.Unknown: In this mostly... wait for it... unknown thriller, five men wake up in a locked-down warehouse with no memory of who they are. They are forced to figure out who is good and who is bad to stay alive. A little like The Killing Room, Unknown sort of fell through the cracks and most people caught it on cable. It has an amazing cast in James Caviezel, Greg Kinnear, Bridget Moynahan, Joe Pantoliano, Barry Pepper, Jeremy Sisto and totally stands up. Peppered with flashback, some may argue this isn't strictly a one-room thriller, but it's close enough in my books.Exam: In new British thriller,, eight talented candidates have reached the final stage of selection to join the ranks of a mysterious and powerful corporation. Entering a windowless room, an ""Invigilator"" gives them 80 minutes to answer one question. He outlines three rules they must obey: don't talk to him or the armed guard by the door, don't spoil their papers and don't leave the room. The candidates turn over their question papers, only to find they're completely blank. Thus begins Stuart Hazeldine's powerful debut, a largely bloodless thriller that nonetheless keeps you guessing until the end. One thing I liked about Exam is the subtle way that Hazeldine makes us feel that we're in a science fiction universe full of designer drugs, economic meltdown and evil corporations without leaving this room. Defintiely worth checking out now that it's on DVD in Stateside.1408 is not just one of the best one-room horror flicks, but it's one of the best Stephen King adaptions yet. It strays a little from the short story by adding a bit of a backstory, but the basic concept of a hack ghost writer who stumbles upon the real thing is examined to its fullest here. I don't know about you guys, but I generally don't like ghost stories. Probably because I've seen too many of them and they always turn out the same (the ghosts need our help). But somehow this one really got under my skin. Also, Cusack is a strong lead here and handles what is essentially a one man show with great dignity.If you're reading this and haven't seen Cube yet, just stop reading, go watch it and come back. Vincenzo Natali's first scifi feature is an indie gem that spawned two sequels. Seven complete strangers are involuntarily placed in an endless kafkaesque maze containing deadly traps. Technically it takes place in multiple rooms - or cubes - but since they are all identical let's agree that it's really the same room.Buried somehow goes beyond storytelling and becomes an experience. It is so claustrophobic and fast-paced that you really feel like you are in that coffin with Reynolds as he fights to figure out what's going on and tries to get rescued. ..."	Thrilled. This word means “to have a sudden feeling of excitement”. Complicated!!Well, I think by thrilled you mean you want to see a movie that will have a huge impact on you, and which will make you think about your believes. A movie which would just stun you.So here's my list.Interstellar by Christopher Nolan. (Off course it's the best)The Dark Knight Trilogy by Christopher Nolan. (No doubts)Inception by Christopher Nolan. (May be you are still dreaming!!)The Prestige by Christopher Nolan. (Epic, just Epic)Forrest Gump. (I don't know what's so good about this one, but it deserves to be here)Now you see me. (This one would surely fullfill your desire to be thrilled. And it also has a sequel, Woohoo)The Lone Ranger. (This one has both thrill factor and an epic story)Ok. So you may be thinking that I am a big fan of Christopher Nolan, and yup I am, but just watch any one of his movies, you will understand why his name came so many times.I actually find Harry Potter too much thrilling, but the books are far better than the movies, so you should read the books. Movies are nothing compared to the books.Edit:I don't know why I forgot this one!Edge of Tomorrow. (Confusing little bit, but very thrilling)Ok, so I have not seen this one. But it's got 8.8/10 on IMDb. So it should be good. FIGHT CLUB by David Fincher.Edit: Ok I saw Fight Club, and it was 1 am when I saw it, and the movie was so good that I was not able to sleep for next two hours!!
is it normal if your sperm does not  shoot out during ejaculation	how do i ensure that semen does not  come out from my penis after i ejaculate	0	Yes. There can be several reasons. The most common is if you ejaculated recently you won't have as much semen. The time varies by person depending on individual bodies, age and how horny you are. I believe a lot of horniness in men comes from the build up of semen in the prostate gland. So age,  physical condition, natural abilities, arousal level and other factors affect that. I wouldn't worry about it. If you are concerned or if your orgasm doesn't feel good or hurts you could have a prostate infection. See a doctor. If you're masturbating daily or more this could be the cause.	You can work some of it out by running your finger along the underside of the penis, pressing into the urethra and going from the base to the tip. However some of it is above what you can reach.
which is the best coaching center for ssc and banking in chandigarh	which are the best ssc and banking coaching centers in chandigarh	1	Foremost thing that matters in clearing any competitive exam is the approach and direction. This is further dependent on the Faculty, Study Material, Mentoring and other important factors.Many of us get into some institutes where a lot of students have already given there attempts 3–4 times or batch strength is more than 30. A beginner can never understand and start from the concepts in these kind of classes. Also, some institutes hire inexperienced faculty and do injustice to their students.I would suggest look for an institute where initially you can attend free demo classes(more than 1), Study material should be updated, faculty who is expert in their subjects like Quant, LR, GS or English, and provide updated testing environment.I have a keen interest in guiding aspirants for govt. jobs and other fields too. I researched about various institutions in Chandigarh by visiting and attending demo classes. I found some are really good in teaching but batch sizes are 30+, some have good material and testing but faculty is inexperienced.There was one institute in Sector 34-A named “My Career”. They have started the institute afresh in Chandigarh although have quite well-reputed center in Bathinda (as some sources told me from the city). Main benefit is it is run by IIM Alumni and very experienced faculty who have actually taught students for MBA. Study material is also fine. Major plus point here would be that they have started in the city, so they are really working hard to give good results and provide good coaching & training to students and hence excel in the league. So, after all research and counsel, I would recommend My Career Institute to all for SSC and Banking Coaching. You guys can atleast visit and attend demo classes there. All the Best !! :)	Foremost thing that matters in clearing any competitive exam is the approach and direction.

what are the best things to do on halloween	what do we need to have the best halloween	1	Going Christmas caroling.Last year my friends and I decided that we wanted to do something different for Halloween.I had heard the idea from another answer on Quora, and decided to give it a try. Our school was doing a holiday food drive, and we decided to give our shenanigans a philanthropic twist. We all dressed in our winter coats, scarves and santa hats, and set off to sing.My friends consist mainly of band kids with a smattering of chior so we weren't bad at singing, just not great. At every house we would wait for them to open the door then launch into our song. When we finished and they offered candy we politely asked for canned food donations instead.In about an hour of caroling, we collected four large shopping bags of food. We delivered it to the school for the food drive the next day.In the end, everyone had a blast and we got some good donations to a charitable cause, so it was a double win.I highly recommend Christmas caroling this Halloween!

i wish to start investing in equity and mutual funds where should i open demat account for best rates transaction charges and so on i am nri	i am 17 and i want to invest money in stock market where should i start	0	For mutual fund investments in India, you do not need a demat account. Select some 2–3 funds (use portals like www.valueresearchonline.com) as per your risk profile and financial goals and buy it DIRECTLY from the website of the Asset Management Company (AMC) - when you buy, you’ll see two plans - regular and direct - select the direct plan. I will advise you NOT to demat your mutual fund holdings - there is no particular advantage of that.As regards stocks, first please check if you have the right temperament to advise in stocks directly - mutual fund will do the same for you, at a very nominal fund management charge in case of a direct plan.Still if you wish to invest in stocks, note that NRI cannot do intra day trading and can invest only through a PIS demat account. You need to ask your bank to open a separate PIS demat account and also open a separate bank account and link the two. More info here: How returning NRIs can invest in Indian equity marketsIf you’re a US based NRI, also note PFIC related implications of your mutual fund investments under US tax law - more here: Decoding IRS Passive Foreign Investment Company (PFIC) Rules & ImplicationsThanks!	This is the most detailed answer I have ever written. If anyone read this he shall be able to trade I feel. I am putting all of my knowledge here that I have gainedI am going to brief you about basic terms like what is Demat account, What is depository, how to place a buy sell on a terminal. What are different types of orders, what if you want to hold your position or want automatic exit in intraday and what is leverage and margin so you don’t have to ask separately. If you have questions like How to select an stock or trade in Options visit Daily Capital Market Dose for It.Well, the first step, talking in India you need a demat account. Now what is that: its an account that holds all the shares that you purchase in electronic or dematerialized form. Basically, a demat account is to your shares what a bank account is to your money. Like the bank account, a demat account holds the certificates of your financial instruments like shares, bonds, government securities, mutual funds and exchange traded funds (ETFs).Now with that definition, let me elaborate you need a demat account only if you are willing to deal in Shares that too taking the delivery or holding the shares for T+1 day. If you want to invest in other than stock market you need a demat. BUT if you are planning only intraday or day trading; you don’t need a demat account. YOU NEED ONLY TRADING ACCOUNT.Role of Demat account:NOW WHAT IS DEPOSITORY &amp; ITS FUNCTIONS:A depository is similar to a bank. It holds shares, which belong to investors, in electronic form. The investor has to open an account with the depository, through a Depository Participant (Broker). The broker is an intermediary between the depository and the investor. In India, there are two depositories, National Securities Depository and Central Depository Services. A number of banks (HDFC Bank, ICICI Bank, SBI, and so on) , brokers ( Zerodha, India Infoline, Motilal Oswal and Indiabulls) and institutions function as DPs.How to open a demat account?Choose a broker on parameters: brokerage charges, annual charges and leverage provided. Fill up a form, submit documents like PAN CARD, CANCEL CHEQUE, ID PROOF, INCOME PROOF (BANK STATEMENT OR ITR) AND INVESTMENT OR MARGIN CHEQUE.NOW WHAT IS MARGIN AND LEVERAGE?Margin is your investment amount that you are investing and leverage is the limit you get on it. Lets say you have 10,000/- to invest that is your margin and leverage is limit that broker provides for trading. Like if he gives you 4 times limit that means you can make a trade where you will need a margin of 40,000/-Why? Because broker make commission on turnover more turnover you make in buy and sell more profit he makes.Now once your demat is open now you get a trading terminal. What is trading terminal? Well its an software that enables you to go online access the Exchange and make a trade in it. You can buy and sell via that terminal. If you are not comfortable online trading, ask your broker to provide you offline trading number. One that number you can share your credentials and ask the person to put the trade on your behalf.This depends on broker to broker but I have a Zerodha account I am explaining you the complete process with them.After account opening, two emails are sent:Welcome emailPassword emailWelcome email contains login and password details to Q, our reporting tool. Q contains all historical reports, tax P&amp;L, ledger, fund withdrawal requests, historical holdings/positions table, trade and P&amp;L visualizations (quant reports) to help improve trading performance and more.Password email contains the trading/Kite user ID, and the first time login password. A prompt to change this while logging into Kite for the first time will be made.Kite is Zerodha trading terminal just like Angel Broking has Angel Eye, Kotak Securities have KEAT, ShareKhan has TRADETIGER.Now trading online: You ne...
why do companies issue bonus shares	why do company issue bonus shares	1	Bonus IssueA bonus issue is a stock dividend, allotted by the company to reward the shareholders. The bonus shares are issued out of the reserves of the company. These are free shares that the shareholders receive against shares that they currently hold. These allotments typically come in a fixed ratio such as, 1:1, 2:1, 3:1 etc.If the ratio is 2:1 ratio, the existing shareholders get 2 additional shares for every 1 share they hold at no additional cost. So if a shareholder owns 100 shares then he will be issued an additional 200 shares, so his total holding will become 300 shares. When the bonus shares are issued, the number of shares the shareholder holds will increase but the overall value of investment will remain the same.Companies issue bonus shares to encourage retail participation, especially when the price per share of a company is very high and it becomes tough for new investors to buy shares. By issuing bonus shares, the number of outstanding shares increases, but the value of each share reduces.In your case you will get 33 shares from the company.HAPPY TRADING…	Bonus IssueA bonus issue is a stock dividend, allotted by the company to reward the shareholders.

how can changing 500 and 1000 rupee notes end the black money in india	do you think scrapping of 500 and 1000 rupee denominations is going to eradicate corruption	1	Let’s see.#1: Till end of the year, people will exchange or deposit existing 500 and 1000 notes at banks and post office. However, you need to show a valid government ID proof and the banks and post offices will have to maintain proper transaction records for the same.For smaller amounts, there should be no issue. But if someone comes and deposits 1L in cash, it might be highlighted and escalated to the government. Modi government might have advised banks and post offices to escalate all transactions above a certain threshold.All of these folks will have their background checks done and can expect a tax audit next year if their tax returns, income details etc do not justify the amount they have in black.#2: Political parties can no longer disburse cash to poor people in exchange for votes.#3: People in the real estate market will be hurt the most.I recently saw a hoarding advertising the price of a new flat for possession at Rs 1.2 Cr. However, the hoarding said, “Rs 1.1 Cr if you pay cash”.The maths is simple. In the first arrangement, you pay 1.2 Cr, of which some 30L goes to government as tax, and 90L goes to the builder. In the second, you pay 1.1 Cr (saving yourself a sweet 10L) and all of it goes to the builder (who nets 20L more). All of it at the loss of the government.Brokers too can no longer ask people to pay in cash. I, as recently as Feb, had to pay 35,000 as the brokerage. All in cash, as the broker would simply not accept an online transfer.#4: All currency hoarded with terrorists and corrupt folks is now simply useless. “A terrorist walked into the bank branch with a briefcase full of cash and a fake ID…” just doesn’t sound funny.#5: All counterfeit currency production comes to a grinding halt. Counterfeiting Rs 100 and below currency notes does not make sense as it is economically unprofitable. So almost all fake currency is in the form of 500 and 1000 notes and no one is going to accept them now, so they are cut off from the money market.Going forward, it would be harder to counterfeit the new 500 and 2000 currency notes as they come with a whole set of new security features.#6: Forces people to resort to the banking system.Majority of the Indian populace isn’t corrupt. They don’t hoard money at home because they want to chat on their taxes. They just do it because they do not trust “online banking” or the banking system. Now these people will be forced to let go of their unfounded fears, slowly moving the nation on the path of becoming a cashless economy.The more people transact online, the easier it would be for the government to keep track of all money movement and catch hold of those who abuse the system.	I think it’s important to understand some basics about black money before judging this giant decision by the government.When we hear ‘Black money’ what most of us imagine is this:And conclude that this is ‘evil’ or ‘bad’ and hence must be cleaned up. And that is all there is to ‘Black money’.The truth is this hoard of cash might be completely legitimate, even if it hidden under a bed - if it has been disclosed to the government and taxes have been paid for it. Then it is white moneyMoney = Cash?I might store all my money(black or white) in bank deposits, or in the form of cash at home - if that makes me happy. I might use it for charitable purposes or to throw a booze party or for a lavish wedding. That’s my right.Money can take the form of cash, real estate, gold or whatever.The only question which makes it black or white is: Have the requisite taxes been paid?If taxes are not paid, then it becomes black money. Now I need to hide this money. Surely bank deposits are not a good idea! If I buy something using this money I need to hide that too. So I buy big things in somebody else’s name(benami transactions), stash it in offshore accounts(which promise secrecy), invest in real estate(by showing lesser value) etc.Note that the cash component is a small part of the total money - especially If I have huge amounts of black money. It is simply impractical to hoard it all in cash.So ‘money’ is NOT the same as CashSo when we say our stated aim is ‘To curb black money’ we are not just hunting for hoards of cash. We are not even hunting for people with lots of real estate, or politicians who have a lot of gold. People can legitimately hold on to all that.We are hunting for hoards of cash, or people with lots of real estate, or politicians who have a lot of gold - who have not paid the taxes on it. And then collect those taxes. And perhaps impose heave penalties to prevent recurrence.But even this catches existing black money. The real solution is to make everybody pay taxes. But maybe catching existing black cash is also a good first step…So let’s analyse how useful this step is.Coming to demonetisation, two things to understand:It directly affects only the cash component of money. Not the real estate, gold etc. that I have. And that too, the part that is in form of 500 or 1000 notes.It affects black and white cash. You and me had white money but still were forced to deposit it in banks.So to judge effectiveness of the demonetisation scheme, we should try to calculate how much of the money is in CASH, and is black, and will be collected - and compare it against the total black money.A - Domestic black money“As Schneider estimates, using the dynamic multiple-indicators multiple-causes method and by currency demand method, that the size of India's black money economy is between 23 and 26%”Source: Indian black money - WikipediaLet us assume it is 25%“The Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in India was worth 2073.54 billion US dollars in 2015”Source: India GDPThis translates to 141 Lakh crores. 25% of this is about 35 Lakh crores.B - Offshore black money“In March 2012, the government of India clarified in its parliament that the CBI director's statement on $500 billion of illegal money[in foreign tax havens] was an estimate based on a statement made to India's Supreme Court in July 2011” Source: Indian black money - WikipediaThis translates to about 34 Lakh croresTotal black money = A + B = 35 + 34 = 69 Lakh croresThe question now is: How much of this black money is in cash and circulating inside India in form of 500 and 1000 Rs notes, which the demonetisation scheme might recover?C - Total currency in 500 and 1000 Rs. notes = 14 Lakh crores“the annual report of Reserve Bank of India (RBI) of 31 March 2016 stated that total bank notes in circulation valued to ₹16.42 lakh crore (US$240 billion) of which nearly 86% (around ₹14.18 lakh cror...
what should i major in college that wo not  leave me unemployed other than engineering law medicine	what should i do in a group discussion when others keep fighting and wo not  let me talk even after i ask them to let me	0	I’m going to start with some very simple, very direct advise that should be taken very seriously.DO NOT GO INTO ENGINEERING OR MEDICINE UNLESS YOU ARE ABSOLUTELY PASSIONATE ABOUT IT.I have seen and work with numerous engineers you became engineers for the sole reason of job security and excellent pay. They make terrible products, do terrible work, cost the company far more than they are worth, and cause untold amounts of grief to their co-workers. Don’t be that guy.Disinterested Doctors have personally screwed up my wife’s health because they failed to listen to her and ignored her charts because they assumed she was a “typical 20 year old” (even though she was approaching 30 at the time which shows how much they ignored her chart). Don’t be that doctor.…I don’t care for law. I personally find it to be one of those useless careers with the exception of people like Barack Obama who devote themselves to passing laws that help the less fortunate. I think that falls under a similar category of passion and interest too, so whatever.Now that I said that… what should you do?If you want employment that has A.) job security B.) pays well and C.) you don’t have a passion about anything you can think to put into a career…I suggest you become a plumber.It will always have huge demand as long as humans have running water and bathrooms. It pays a ton (250k USD/year average mid-career which is WAAAAYYY more than I make as an engineer), requires no additional schooling (i.e. no student loan dept). These are also not the “jobs” politicians say we need more of (those are more manufacturing/resource allocation type positions). Plumbers are in high demand are their demand is expected to increase as more kids your age are going to college and more plumbers retire.So what do you do about your parents and college???Lie to them. Tell them you’re going to college. Take their money for college (I’m assuming this non-optional push is because they are paying for it, if not then WTF), and invest it in something fairly stable (I would say US bonds but I’m and engineer not an investor or financial adviser so go talk them to get a better idea about it). When your parents find out (and they will eventually) give them their money back with the interest you made on it (after all that was their money). They will probably be sad/disappointed you lied and didn’t go to college but they will be happy that you had your head on your shoulders, made a good financial decision and made them money in doing so. Eventually they will realize that their preconceived notions of what may be a good future for you may not be the case in today’s world as the cost/benefit ratio of a college degree is going way south.Meanwhile you can show up to their house on Thanksgiving in your new Ferrari after you paid off your home in full in 3 years because you decided to not take their advice and go to college.NOTE: I would like to add that going after your passion and what you are talented at is a better choice than doing this but many high-school graduates/college bound freshmen don’t know what their passions or talents are and use college as a super expensive way of finding out about a very small part of themselves. This is a far better option if that is the case for you.And you can always go to college later when you find your bliss (or skip it altogether and start your own business doing your bliss you should be very knowledgeable in the real world by then even if you don’t feel like it)	A2A.Well, a group discussion is technically a discussion. So, there's no point in people arguing without letting anyone speak. But that is what happens almost every time because most of the time, your job is on the line.Infact, even though people have no point to speak, then too they will jump in the argument and soon it will become a fish market. Most of the time the groups will be very big with as much as 25 people in a group and the time given will be mere 15 mins max. So, it's very difficult to keep your point forward.I have been part of many GDs and I have done reasonably well in all of them. So, I will just share my experience.Indian army selection in campus - My first GD for a job. 22 people were in a single group. The topic was a very general one. After two people spoke, everyone started jumping in. Soon, nothing was audible but still the GD was going on. I was pissed off with all the noise, so I shouted, “EK MINUTE” (one minute!). It was kind of an involuntary action. My voice was very loud and everyone literally stopped and they were staring at me. I went ahead and spoke for half a minute. I didn't know whether what I did was correct or not but certainly I had an impact. Result - selected.Indian army in ssb - I had a series of GDs here, as much as 5 if I remember. The first one was the most tricky one because there were 22 people in a group. Again everyone started arguing with only 5 to 6 people shouting at peak of their voices and others keeping quiet. One of the fellow member who was sitting right beside me was literally shouting. Again, involuntarily, I shouted in an even bold voice and told him to let others speak. Probably, not the wisest thing I would have done but it had its effect. He kept quiet and others, including me were able to speak. Result - selected.BPCL GD - 16 people were in my group and again (sigh!) same thing happened. Only 4 people out of 16 were speaking in a very loud voice. I was one of them (:P). But as soon as I was seeing people other than these 3 speak, I was stopping for them to complete. Others were not doing the same and one of them got rejected for this very reason. Result - selected.So, I think the most important thing is how bold your voice is. No one is going to help you in this. You have to grab your chances and speak. One thing you can do is prepare for what you are going to speak when others are shouting. Then with confidence go for the chance. Also, make sure that you are not overdoing this. Give others chance to speak. The assessors wants to see two main things - your communication skills and leadership skills. Also make sure you listen carefully when someone speaks or at least pretend to do so.Read my other answers for other things you can do in GD.Good luck!

is there any architectural complexcenterforumhub anywhere in the world as a third space	is there any online software available for calculating the time and space complexity of a java program in big o	0	"I predict the Berlin scene will slowly move further into Eastern Europe, in particular to Warsaw and Krakow Poland, and maybe later on to somewhere like Vilnius, Lithuania, or even Belgrade, Serbia. These locations are cheap, historically rich, and have very interesting developing alternative art and music scenes--lots of electronic music, goth/punk, and even some rap, surprisingly enough. Poland is very up-and-coming these days. I think we'll be seeing a lot of interesting art and music coming out of there in the next 5 to 10 years, and more and more people moving there... especially Krakow. Poland is currently celebrating it's autonomy, democracy and emerging economy. As a result, Krakow is becoming hot. But Warsaw is also up-and-coming and is full of unoccupied industrial spaces, so Warsaw--is my top candidate for ""the next Berlin.""Istanbul is another option. It's cultural wealth has no parallel, and it's art and tech scenes are growing rapidly. It's also the nexus of the East and the West. Istanbul is, quite possibly, the next Berlin.In the US, I could see any of: Baltimore/Detroit/New Orleans becoming the new North American alternative arts hub. All of these cities are suffering from depressed economies and therefore there exist many cheap places for artists to rent space and create. I also believe that local governments may be more permissive to nightclubs than in other jurisdictions as part of the urban renewal of these cities. Baltimore has an incredibly influential independent music scene in addition to a vibrant art scene and cheap rent. Detroit and NoLa seem to be in earlier stages of community development than Baltimore. I think Detroit has a great chance due to all the cheap property. And NoLa has a great chance because it's SO culturally vibrant and historical. All are very dangerous, but that will change with gentrification.Montreal was mentioned, but it's already an international alternative arts hub. People aren't going to start moving to Montreal in droves because it's not as cheap as Berlin and the gentrification already started... years ago.In South America, I've heard that Lima is becoming hot. (See ""Vampires of Lima"" in What was the Hipster?) Buenos Aires has a great art/music scene and cheap rent, but it's not particularly ""alternative"" and its identity is already formed. In your question, you asked ""what's next?"" and Buenos Aires is happening now and has been happening for awhile. Maybe Lima is next. It's way too early to tell though.Sao Paulo, Brazil and Santiago, Chile are also on my artistic radar... but they're too formed and expensive already for one to think they could turn into the sort of alternative arts hub Berlin is today."	To make the entire process automatically is not possible. However, there is at least one online tool I know that might help you in the specific case of calculating the order of complexity of recursive functions using the Master Theorem:Master theorem solver (JavaScript)This is very handy for me, since these are exactly the type of functions I find harder to calculate the complexity and that are not too infrequent that I could ignore them most of the time.Note that the Master Theorem does not solve the complexity of any recursive function, only those that fit the theorem, and that you still need to be able to describe the complexity function of your program by yourself.
what is the hardest thing  about raising children in ukraine	what is the hardest thing  about raising children in mexico	0	I don’t have children but my sister does. I live very close to them and sometimes look after the kids.The most challenging part is actually to have enough money to maintain a normal living for your family.AccommadationFirst you need to live somewhere . Some people cannot afford living separately from their parents. In that case they don’t always get along with each other.Few people can afford buying an apartment . Very often parents financially help their grown children to buy one.So you might rent one paying about 20–30% of you salary. It’s fine when you’re alone and can move if your landlord tells you to. But if you have kids you want more stable conditions.TransportIf you have small kids sometimes you need to take them to a hospital very quickly. You would better have a car. Not everyone can afford a new car in Ukraine. You might buy a used one but then you spend money on a repair.Education is officially free in Ukraine. But actually parents spend a lot of money on their’s children schools. Teachers come up with different excuse to leach money from parents. For instance for a repair, for new windows. Some teachers offer additional paid classes for kids who are ‘lagging behind’ to boost their knowledge. But actually it’s a good way to earn money from pupils’ parents.Often teacher have no one choice because their salaries are a joke.Healthcare is also free in Ukraine. But if you go to hospital they have a million ways to charge money from you especially if we are talking about kids. Doctors might earn only 200$ in Ukraine. So very often you need to pay ‘under the counter’I didn’t mention some obvious expenditures on food, cloths and so on	Well, we did actually raise three daughters in Mexico, between 1991 and 2011, 20 years! And yes, the education system in Mexico is, diplomatically expressed, really hard to manage for parents.According to the Constitution, in Mexico Education is supposed to belaicistic, meaning religion has no influence over it and no religious topics are taught.mandatory, meaning no child should go without itfree of charge, meaning, well, no money is charged to parents.They do a pretty good job with the laicism thing. No religious doctrine, no religious signs in classrooms, etc. I always could live with this as do most Mexicans. We can live our faith in the Church and at home.Mandatory, well, it’s on the law books but it is not the only law in Mexico getting ignored, so do not get surprised when you see kids in the street selling stuff in school hours. They might go to evening classes!Free of charge? No way. You as the parents must pay the “cuota”! School principals have found a way to charge parents “a voluntary contribution” and then you can only buy the mandatory school uniform at authorized dealers (family of a teacher or principal) And for every little holiday on the calender there is a collection for candies and cake, with a kickpack to each teacher. And then the inscription fee. And you must contribute with cleaning supplies and toilet paper. All these fees are supposedly for improving the installations, but most of it disappears in the wallets of the teaching staff. Kids learn an important lesson, though. “Quien no tranza no avanza” meaning if you do not cheat you do not get anywhere. In a strange way of coincidence, the drug cartel members call their extortion “cuota” as well. A lesson well learned!“Bonnie and Clyde” (my wife an myself) tried to get people raising their voices against this injustice, the amounts can be as high as a monthly salary of a minimum wage worker. But people prefer to not eat and let go their water bills unpaid in order to pay the school. Out of fear of retaliation from the teachers against their kids. After a few years of windmill fighting we finally gave in and took them to private school. My wife got herself a bitter foe in the school principal, when she would oversee the spending of the funds and no kickbacks got paid out for 2 years to school staff.There are more hoops to jump through when having kids in Mexico!Registring your offspring at the civil registry so they can have a birth certificate and a passport later on. You will stand in line, babies bundled up in several blankets, at 4 A.M in line at the office - which opens like at 9. Otherwise you will get denied access and you have to come back. If you wait 6 months or longer, you will run into trouble for late registry, and your kid will have lifelong troubles for it when asking for a passport (I know, because our second born was registered late)And you better marry a woman whose immune system is compatible with yours. (If you are smart you do, because you WILL find her magically attractive according to some investigation!) Then, your sexlife is great and your kids get never sick. Because the public health system in Mexico is understaffed and underfunded. But they do a good job at vaccinating - and can you believe it? No lines! We did go with those few ailments that came through the super duper immune system of the girls to a private clinic. You pay, but the service is very good. And payment was reasonable.Sounds like a lot of hassles and I should have had the kids in Switzerland?Hell no!In Switzerland, Schools are free of charge. But also a bully’s paradise! For we Swiss are too whimpy to deal with it. In Mexico, I am glad to say that this was not tolerated. You be a bully - you are out! For good.And there are lots of other advantages of raising kids in Mexico. If such a question pops up, I will go much longer on it!

The real issue isn't that there's a paucity of useful webpages on the internet, it's that taking advantage of those webpages is difficult. What does it say about human beings that we really can get an Ivy League education for free online but nearly nobody does it? The Coursera and Udacity and Khan Academy attrition rates are so phenomenal that it makes the completion rates look like round-off errors. We live in an attention-deficit culture, and the solution isn't better websites, it's better humans.In view of spending your time more effectively, I suggest the following tips:Completely cut Facebook, Reddit, Twitter, and any other social sites out of your life. If you are unable to do this, strictly regulate the total time spent on these sites to 30 minutes to an hour each day. You can download Chrome extensions to help you with this like StayFocusd. But, I cannot emphasize enough how much these sites will ruin your life. Everyone always comes to the defense of social media with excuses like, ""well, I use Facebook to keep in touch with my high school friends and relatives overseas,"" or ""Twitter is how I stay up-to-date with current events,"" or ""you can learn lots of great things with specialized subreddits,"" and so on. Yet when you look at a distribution of how people actually allocate their time, nearly none of it is spent doing the very things that people point to when they justify their behavior. It's always just mindless scrolling, animated gifs, cat videos, the first twenty seconds of a really neat lecture, and so on.What could be a more devastating rebuke of social media than the fact that nobody uses it for the reasons it was designed? This is, of course, auxiliary to the more important reality that research on Facebook consistently shows that it makes everyone more sad and less fulfilled with life on average.Practice efficient procrastination. If you need time to recharge in between difficult activities, find outlets in which you can still develop yourself as a person. For me, that's chess. I'll play a couple games of Blitz in between projects to recharge, and, more importantly, I'm not watching cat videos. For other people it might be practicing an instrument, or reading a book, or drawing.To-do lists. There may be nothing more insanely effective than a to-do list. Write down what you have to do, prioritize the list by difficulty, and be excruciatingly detailed when you write down your objectives. Don't get fancy, don't use Evernote or a Chrome Extension, or some app, just use paper and pen. Don't write ""Finish research paper on ethics."" Write ""Write one page on Chapter 3 of Peter Singer's 'Practical Ethics."" The smaller, more discrete the tasks, the more superable they become. Also plan how you are going to efficiently procrastinate in between the tasks. Write ""play chess"", ""watch a Noam Chomsky lecture"", ""do one lesson of DuoLingo,"" and so forth in between big tasks. Take a power nap if you're too exhausted to be efficient with your procrastination. Remember: when you don't plan your time, you fail to take advantage of opportunities that avail themselves, and you go for the path of least resistance -- which usually happens to be AngryBirds and YouTube videos.Who cares? This is perhaps the most important point. Next time you are about to post something to Facebook, or watch a funny video, or read a blog post, or get involved in an internet argument, ask yourself: Who cares?  If something isn't helping you to become a better you, don't waste your time. Today I read a BuzzFeed article on ""Epic Twitter Comebacks."" I was baited into reading the article by the outrageous title, and subsequently became angry at myself for finishing it. The article just didn't matter. Nothing productive could possibly come from reading or writing it. The most popular articles shared anywhere -- Facebook, Buzzfeed, and the countless copycat sites-- are the journalistic equivalent of McDonald's. Consuming them makes everybody worse off.I have found myself knee-deep in an hour long compilation of Vines, and twenty minutes in, I have to do a reality check: This shit literally does not matter. The world would be a better place if all of it just disappeared. What possible value could there be spending all your time mindlessly consuming 7 second videos for hours at a time? It doesn't make you happier, it doesn't leave a lasting feeling of satisfaction; it is just raw, unproductive consumption.Now step back, and think of all the countless hours spent in front of screens, convincing yourself that it's just one more video, or just one more picture, just one more.. and then remember that this is your life. How we spend our days is how we spend our lives. This is it, this is all we have; you are the aggregate of your experiences. Do you want the average of those experiences to be summarized by a few URLs, a couple videos, and some half-hearted commitments to better yourself? So be vigilant! When you find yourself immersed in mindless consumption, ask yourself: ""Who cares?"" If what you're doing right isn't helping you become a better you, do something else."
why does india sabotage and badmouth all economic projects which its neighbouring counries have in the world	why does india always sabotage and badmouth all economic projects pakistan have with other countries in the world	0	You have wrong facts in your question. India is not badmouthing OBOR anywhere. OBOR has CPEC as its part and that’s where we raised the issue of sovereignty of our nation. CPEC is planned to be built in POK, which still is our land.Secondly India is not the only country, leaders, ministers and officials from Germany, France, England, Greece, Portugal and Estonia had objections to the original text of the communique over issues of transparency and environmental protection. http://m.economictimes.com/news/...If China says India has no right at doka la region in Sikkim and it's the third party nation there, the same goes with China in Kashmir. We can't just sit mum.It is endorsed by UNSC because no nation in that council has any problem with it. That's why China is not letting India in UNSC as a permanent member, because then we too will have Vito powers. It is just a fact that this membership was given to India, but because of the worst decision ever by our former prime minister Nehru Ji, we gave it to our “lovely” neighbours.	What you are questioning is a world wide phenomenon brought about by high technology and social networking. It has placed unbelievable power in individual tweets, from the President Elect of the US to ISIS.It is not unique to the United States and has defied regulatory, governing and stultifying attempts by any and all countries who have attempted to control it.It is the new “Wild West” and we are just beginning to explore it and the technology that supports it, along with the unintended consequences.Are Technology and Unintended Consequences Moving Too Fast for Our Governments to Manage?
what does a wet vagina feel like for a man	why does it feel like there is a ball in my vagina	0	Yes, it feels wonderful, this is exactly what every guys want during sex, or you can say that it is a gift of nature, that a women's vagina get wet when they are sexually aroused.During intercourse, either penis or vagina needs to be get wet to proceed the things very smooth. Simply, it helps penis to easily slide into her vagina. Otherwise, human body parts generates a lot of friction to avoid any movement against eachother.Once, when I have a sex with my girlfriend, her vagina get wet after 10 minutes of very slow foreplay. Then I uses that wetness to rub my penis against her clitoris and she was moaning like a real slut. This all end up with a very successful intercourse.	I made my own list about things that are not socially acceptable. Well, at least in many societies… I wish these things were socially acceptable:MEN WHO CRYI hate ‘real men don't cry’ word. Men are also human, and humans cry sometimes.GOING TO CINEMA ALONEWe don’t need a friend or boyfriend/girlfriend to watch the movie we want. We watch movies alone at home, so why not in a cinema.REPEATING THE SAME OUTFITIf we really love an outfit, why shouldn’t we wear it multiple times in a week? Many people, especially women still think too much about what to wear every day.We should just prefer our favorite one again if we want to wear it. Kate Middleton repeats many looks again and again. And she looks classy all the time.the source:[1]OLDER WOMAN-YOUNGER MAN RELATIONSHIPWhen men are older, it is not that problem. But when women are older, our society reacts that situation and talk about their relationship in many rude ways. It is totally OK if they are both adults. And it is nobody’s business. Older women-younger men relationships should also be socially acceptable.BEING A GAMER GIRL/WOMANI am also a woman gamer. And many people surprise when they realize that I am a woman who beat them on video games. And a lot of people show negative reactions to woman/girl gamers. I don’t like when people try to set gender rules on video games. Women also deserve to play video games. So, it should be socially acceptable.WEARING FLIP-FLOPS ALMOST EVERWHEREFlip-flops are freedom! I personally wear them a lot of times in summers. I am a Turk who live in Turkey. When I am in İzmir, it is ok because there are also people who wear flip flops daily, but when I visit other cities of Turkey, for example, İstanbul or Eskişehir, people look at my feet and then my face and they probably think that I am a tourist because of my flip-flops.But I keep wearing it, and I also suggest you wear it. Do not care if people think you look like a tourist or not. Enjoy it. They are comfortable.MEN WHO WEAR SKIRTS/DRESS/CAFTANEven if it is in many cultures, there is still a social bias about skirt/dress wearing men.WOMEN SHOULD BE SEXUALLY PURE, AND GET DRESSED PROPERLYIt is another social problem which depends on sexism in our society. I really hate sexism, so every sexist social norm annoys me a lot.Women’s sexuality is controlled through slut shaming. Many men would still be uncomfortable being with a woman who had slept with many more people than he had – and many men still feel comfortable referring to women as “slags” or “sluts” for indulging in behavior that would make a man a “stud” or a “lad”.[2]And many of our societies are still judge women about their clothes.the source:[3]NAPING EVERYWHERE YOU WANTIf you take a nap outside and carry your wallet and phone with you, it is a risk, I know. But if you are in a safe area, taking a nap should be socially acceptable.Sleeping parliamentarians in the Turkish Parliament. Well… Maybe sleeping everywhere shouldn’t be acceptable. At least not in parliaments.Thanks for reading. ;)Footnotes[1] 35 stunning looks Kate Middleton repeats again and again[2] One of the most famous pictures in the world is of a serious sexual assault and no one mentions it...
will thursday night football increase ratings for cbs on thursday nights rather than the big bang theory	why is the big bang theory tv series so popular why is it so popular with mainstream viewers	0	There's a couple of possibilities...1.  Thursday Night Football kickoffs are set at 8:30, BBT runs at 8...I kinda doubt this will occur2.  BBT moves to another night for the 17 weeks of football season (my bet would be Wednesday).3.  BBT doesn't start until January, when Thursday Night football ends (least likely of all)We won't know the answer until CBS releases it's schedule, this usually happens in Mayish.	"The trick with any of the shows like this is what you think it's about isn't necessarily what it's about. While the characters are scientists, the plots are rarely about the science itself, they're still just character studies.The individual characters each have their own audience that works well for the show. Leonard, who I would call the ""star"" (yes, above Sheldon), is definitely the most self-aware of the characters and the first draw for the audience. He's the ""geek that wants to be a normal boy"", but he's never embarrassed about his knowledge. There are many more people (that is most) who feel like perpetual outsiders so this creates a relatable character.Sheldon's character is interesting because it's a type of person who is simultaneously a genius yet we in the audience can sometimes feel superior to because we ""get"" things he doesn't where human behavior is concerned. There are many parallels between his character, and Dick Solomon (John Lithgow) on 3rd Rock From the Sun. (In fact, this would be a good college essay). They're both incredibly intelligent people who are baffled by the inconsistencies and rules of society behavior. Their brilliant logic fails them because people aren't logical, and as an audience, we find humor in having stupid inconsistent things pointed out. (Standup comics everywhere know this, that's their bread-and-butter. Is there a difference between Sheldon questioning a dating ritual and Jerry Sienfled asking ""why is there a slot for used razor blades in an airplane bathroom? Who's shaving in there, and going through so many they have to dispose of them?"")Penny is our entry point, she's us as the audience, and we see things through her eyes. Howard and Raj are (were) the Lenny and Squiggy of TBBT, more comic relief in the beginning though now much stronger characters in their own right as they were developed in later seasons. Beyond the characters, some of the success is just because Geek Culture is just part of the cultural fabric now. Once Comic-Con went mainstream, that was a big shift that geeky was celebrated instead of a target for ridicule. We have ""celebrity CEOs"" like the late Steve Jobs and Mark Zuckerberg who are technical, not sports stars, and it's allowed smart people to not necessarily have to be closeted about it.But at the end of the day, it's the characters relating to each other that brings us in. Star Trek was always at it's most successful when it used the science and the space travel as a backdrop for fundamentally emotional stories (this applies to both the series and the movies). The more ""technical they got"" (where the plot was no longer about ""where is this guy hiding and can we find him""  -- but whether they ""could fix the gamma ray in time to output 50 megarems of hydrotonium  to collapse the star so the neighboring galaxy would ---"" ugh), most audiences just gave up and bailed at that point. As long as Big Bang focuses on the human, it will be relatable to a wide audience."
how can i grow taller at 17	how can you increase your height	0	Length of a human being depends on the length of his/her bones, especially long bones.So these bones have growing ends, which grow upto a certain age.After the growing ends have ossified , we stop growing in height.The age of ossification is different in boys and girls.Girls usually stop growing at a younger age than boys.So if you are a girl, I am afraid you don't have much of a chance to grow anymore.Your parents height :Wow!! My parents are almost the same as yours in comparison to height.So there is this formula of calculating a child's height from parents height.Mid parental height=(father's height +mother's height in cm +/-13) ÷2( + in case of male and - in case of female)Now the target height of the child is MPH+/-8.5 cmSo lets calculate.If you are a boy, your MPH should be, (167+162.5+13)÷2=171.5 cmAnd if you are a girl, then it should be,(167+162–13)÷2=158.25So remember the formula for target height? yes, MPH+/- 8.5 cm.So if a boy, 171.5+/-8.5 cmIf a girl, 158.25+/-8.5cmThose are your normal ranges. God I hate calculations!! Haha!!My storySo I was this average height guy, in school. At the end of Med school, tallest of the class. Ok, so what did I do? Nothing actually.I ate normally, slept, played, swam, did some cycling etc etc.Normally it's said that bones grow during ur sleep. So try to have a proper amount of sleep, eat proper amount of calcium containing foods, drink milk, get a bit of sun exposure if u don't, cause vitamin D is important too.Best of luck.Forgot to add, I am 6 feet 2 inches by the way.	Thanks for asking this questionYes,that’s me and my age is 23 now and anyone can increase height after 18 and there is definitely a scientific way to increase height after 18,20,25,30Because pituitary gland meditation and magnet therapy is best way to active it.90% of Indians prefer allopathy over AYUSH and India is a place of Mahayogi God Bholenath and our ancestors and Yog Rishi practices from many days now a days people want to find result in some days but nobody can increase height in some days because increasing your height as not easy as you seen in advertisement and commercial our body growth is depend on many points as we have consume proper body nutrition and protein for effectively grow our body so we have be patience to increase our height .I had used many nutrition and height gain supplement for increasing my height but i have not got effective result from there then i read about naturopathy and mediation help to us increasing our height after 20 then i used many naturopathy therapy as kundalani yoga, meditation and magnet therapy also and magnet therapy is best for after age of 20 because our pituitary gland got blocked after the age of 20 so if you want to active it through natural process ,you have to do meditation ,yoga but for doing effective meditation we have good concentration power and time, it is usually used by many lamba sadhu in ladakh ,they used it for open their third eye so you have need so much will power to effectively perform it but in magnet therapy naturopathy doctor used some natural bio magnet to put it on your middle of head to active your pituitary gland but for doing it effectively ,you have need some consultancy services of doctor and it is used till 6 months and above to getting good result but this is scientific way to active your pituitary gland and if you need any product on based on this therapy then you can purchased Dr Relief Smart height increaser, You can use this product and track the results and growth over a period of time.

have you ever been fired	have you ever been fired how did you deal with it	1	I actually got fired fairly recently. I was working for a company in Atlanta, programming sensitive measuring devices for quality inspections. In 2015, the company hired a new supervisor, who was simply a terrible person to work with. She and I did not get along and, the first chance she got, she fired me. Luckily for me, I was also doing contract work on the side, and one of the company's I was consulting hired me fulltime before the week was out. I was only unemployed for three days.Unlucky for my previous employer, there was no one in the organization who could do my job. My former boss was so detached that she didn't even realize this until after I was gone. About two weeks later, the entire department had come to a screeching stop, and they actually called and asked if I wanted to return to work. They might have been a little hasty in their decision, they said. They had done a little soul searching, and were willing to let me come back on a “probationary” basis.Well, I was able to tell them thanks but no thanks. I already had another job making more money.A few more days went by, and they called me yet again, and asked if I could, at least, come back and train someone. HR actually insinuated that I had, somehow, treated the company unfairly.I told them I would be more than happy to come back and train someone… for 50 bucks an hour, that is.Hell no. That was highway robbery; they simply wouldn't pay it.“Suit yourself.” I replied.Another week went by, and work continued to pile up. They were still trying to find someone to help them out, but things were going very slowly. By the middle of the week, they called me back, and agreed to my terms. However, by this time, I just wanted to be an ass, so I told them that my price had gone up. I was now charging 75 an hour for training.Of course this went over like a concrete balloon, and they told me that they weren't going to be exploited by a former employee.“Fine by me,” I replied. “But don't call me again.”Well, this time they didn't call back. Instead they contacted the manufacturer, and had them send in a Tech to train a few people.What did he charge them?I heard through the grapevine that it was around 5000 a week and, by my calculations, my dismissal ended up costing the company around 30,000 dollars. At least that’s been the tally so far.Man… they REALLY showed me.LOL.	I actually got fired fairly recently.

how on earth would i dress like a workout guy from the year 1990 in the summer	how would i dress like a workout guru from the year 1990 in the summer	1	Showing my age here…Male or female, that would have to involve spandex!

my girlfriend has stopped talking to me what should i do	my girlfriend is not talking to me what should i do	1	It happens all the time with everyone at some point or the other. I have had friends, female friends, girlfriends do that to me in the past. All you can do is try to get in touch with them a few times and if they don’t respond after a few attempts ( Let’s say 6), you need to let them go and live your life. If they are not replying after repeated attempts you made to talk to them, that means, they are ignoring you for dead sure.!In these cases, you don’t have to feel bad, but good that YOU tried your best to get in touch with the person. You were the BIGGER man/woman who swallowed the insults and non-acknowledgement and still made an effort. If the friendship broke, it is not your fault anymore because you were the one who tried to stay in touch and tried to communicate. It is on the person who is ignoring to talk to you now, you did your best. Forget this person and move on. Keep your doors open for them to walk back in your life, remember, there is a difference between you and this ignoring person, let the difference remain, Stay CLASSY, but remind them of their behavior when they come back in your life.There are many, many people out there of all kinds of age, sex, race, nationalities and background that you can befriend . All you have to do is be a good, honest person with pure intentions, you be humble and the world will salute you!Good luck.	I don't know. But this I'm guessing is an anger reaction and she doesn't want to interact with person she's angry with.I guess the best option is to give her space. Well she's actually forcing you to give her space.you can only control yourself and your reactions. So I would suggest spending some quiet down time and analyze the situation that led up to thisThen move on if that's what she wants. You won't regret taking the high road and being kind.
what will the real estate look like now after the 500 and 1000 scraping	how will abolishing rs 500 and rs 1000 notes affect the real estate businesses in india	1	I strongly disagree with most of the answers here. Don’t let “so called economists” mislead you who says after demonetization of 500/1000 rupees notes, the real estate sector will go down, without correcting your facts.People are claiming that real estate industry involves the maximum amount of black money, and as there will be shortage of black money after government’s bold decision, the demand for the properties will reduce. And as the demand supply graph works, lower demand means lower prices. The thing you are missing here is, real estate sector is not just about black money and pricing system in an industry is not just about demand and supply relation.We can divide this industry in majorly two parts to understand the effects of currency ban:1. Agriculture land and individual plots: These are the two types of properties which might see the downfall.These properties are generally bought long back with a very lesser amount compared to the present rates, so the prices of these two types of properties are completely depended on the market value. So if the market value of any property decreases, automatically the price of that property will decrease. Now since these properties involve the maximum amount of black money, shortage of black money will reduce the number of potential buyers from market, reducing market value, finally reducing the prices.2. All the other type of properties (Commercial office spaces, apartments, developer plots, villas etc.)These types of properties involve negligible or no black money. So the reduction of black money will have minimum effect on the demand of these types of properties.Secondly prices of these are not just depended on the market demand. A huge amount is first invested by builders to develop the property. So in these cases margins on invested amount plays a major role in deciding the property’s price. Since the real estate market has already been witnessing recession since last 3 years, builders have reduced their margins to the lowest. So there is no further scope of price reductions as no businessman will sell his product with a loss. The prices may stay still, but will not see downfall for sure.The mentioned points are the cases when the demand stays the same as before or goes down. But we should notice here that since the banks will be flooded with cash after government’s decision of demonetization of 500/1000 rupees notes, the loan process will be eased and the interest rates will be reduced. These properties were already being transacted without any black money, and now since there would be easy home loans at lower interest rates, demand of these properties might even INCREASE.So guys please correct your facts and stop believing everything you read. This time is the best time to buy property. The prices may not go up in a short span, but these will not go down for sure.	I strongly disagree with most of the answers here.

what are the best interview questions ever asked	what are the best interview questions to ask	1	IIM Shillong Interview : 2017This was one unique question I faced since it was no where related to management (in an IIM interview). The reason being, I discussed about administrative services in CD (Case based GD as well).Panel members : P Candidate : SP : Sandeep, you brought in a point about administration & you said you are a logical thinker as well. Let me put you in a situation.S : Okay sir .P : You are the collector of a big unit like Lucknow. At morning 4 am, you receive a call that there has been a bus accident and some people are killed as well as injured. Just when you were about to leave , you receive another phone call that some drunk people (about 6–7) are drowning in the river. When you were just deciding what to do next, you receive third call saying that nearest biggest cinema hall has caught fire, it’s almost like a pride for the city of Lucknow. You have just 1 minute to decide. What will be your plan of action?(I like puzzles. Every puzzle has some catch. For me, the catch here is he never really mentioned about any victims in the cinema hall. That was my Eureka moment ! )S : Sir, my least priority would be the cinema hall. Since it’s 4am in the morning, it should be safe to assume there were no movies being played and it should be empty. Hence, my presence won’t change anything. I would dispatch fire emergency services there. Second would be the river drowning. Even if I go there, I don’t know swimming and hence won’t be of much value there. Hence I would send river search operation teams and be in touch with local authorities there. My highest priority would be bus accident since there would be a lot of chaos there. In case of deaths, people block roads which affect the general transport system. Hence the loss would be much higher here.P : What if I say the cinema hall belonged to the most important politician of your state?S : Then, he himself would ensure everything since he would be more desperate to save his property. It’s not even a concern for me then!Panel members laughing ! Verdict : ConvertedConclusion : In puzzles , devil lies in the details. Since I was very much cool about the interview (not much interested for IIMS) and he warned me that he is going to give a puzzle. I listened to his pointers carefully. That really helped !

i trust people very quickly and as a result always have been betrayed what do i do not to trust people and still hold the relation simple	do you think trusting other people is wise enough after being betrayed by someone else	0	When you start involving your emotions, you either start trusting them or doubting them.Trusting them means you believe they will not let you down in any way. But humans are not perfect, and neither are you. Trusting is gambling, but in the share market. Any logical human with common sense must know, the share market is not at all gambling. It's completely logical. The shares are bid on the basis of their demand and supply, their financial results, the psychological expectations of the investors in the market, etc. All of these factors are analyzed, and then a decision is taken if a particular security (Equity) is worth investing in. And even then it is unpredictable! To keep the relationship simple, you have to keep the relationship strictly platonic from your point of view. (Don't make it clear to others, just keep it to yourself)That is not easy. And you might just come off as robotic or something. Taking every decision based on the logic of trade, whatever they give you - you give back. And whenever courtesy requires, you're the first one to give. You observe, and invest your trust. How?Gayathri Ganesan's answer to I trust people very quickly and as a result always have been betrayed? What do I do not to trust people and still hold the relation simple? Using logic.But you have to keep in mind, to not to care about whatever anyone might think of you. Because if you're worried about trust, you can't be worried about your image at the same time.Strictly platonic, like I said. Though, I don't think it's always possible. All the best!Thanks for the A2A. Hope this helps!	I'm sitting here trying to puzzle out how to say this. I think that one is vulnerable when young and hormones are going crazy. That is when we fall passionately in love and are unable to assess other people's motives clearly. This gets easier as you get older. I'm still not expressing what I want to.Okay, this is going to sound a bit harsh. I don't 'trust' anybody, because we are human, we make mistakes, we let people down, we do. I love people and enjoy them in small doses, but I have no expectations of them. We are all different and you have to respect this. You can choose to give love but there is absolutely no guarantee that you will receive it in return. But its about giving it, not receiving it. You cannot place expectations on other people, only yourself, or you are living in denial and will be hurt terribly. Learn to trust yourself.

what is the dhp vaccine for dogs for is it necessary	can rabies vaccine for humans be used for dog	0	"Yes, usually you see an extra ""P"" in the name of the vaccine, e.g., DHPP, DHPPV, DA2PPV or DA2PP, where ""V"" stands for virus and ""A2"" refers to the two adenoviruses that cause canine hepatitis.P = distemper - Distemper is a canine viral illness which has an 80-90% mortality rate and no effective treatmentH = hepatitis - Hepatitis is a liver disease which is associated with a high mortality rate in dogs, and treatment is only supportive;  vaccine prevents liver damageP = parvovirus - Viral illness that is highly contagious; can quickly be lethal, especially in puppies; treatment is again. symptomatic and supportiveP = parovirus - Mild respiratory disease in dogsDistemper, hepatitis and parvovirus and considered ""core"" vaccinations, vaccinations for diseases which pose a threat to all dogs, and so vaccination is recommended. Paravirus is an optional, or non-core vaccination. Non-core vaccinations are given based on the individual dog's risk factors, including geographical location. Rabies is the only vaccination required by law (in the United States), and it is given separately from the DDHP, that is, in a different syringe. If you have a veterinarian, or can find one who is open to testing for antibody titers, your dog may not need boosters of these vaccinations as often as usual, with the exception of the rabies vaccination. In the United States at least, rabies titers, though a valid predictor of immunity, are not a legal substitute for vaccination.For more information, see the following: How Often Should You Give Your Pet a Vaccination?Vaccine Titer TestsTiter TestingThe Truth About 'Titering' Instead of Vaccination"	Human vaccine is quite a bit more expensive, I believe.I asked my vet why dog rabies vaccine is so inexpensive compared to human vaccine, which I don’t recall her answering. I also asked what would happen if humans were injected with the vaccine prepared for canines and she gave me a complicated answer about how the dead virus is mixed with stuff that is either good for stirring up the human immune response, or it is mixed with the stuff that is good for stirring up canine, feline, or other immune systems. Dog vaccine wouldn’t be very effective when used on humans, so you wouldn’t get the immunity you hoped for, and the same would apply if you tried to use human vaccine on a dog.So, simplistically viewed, they should be the same (although I think the quality control requirements for human vaccine are much more stringent), but when everything is sorted out it turns out that can’t be substituted.You’re going to pay so much for human vaccine I don’t know why anybody would even want to try it. The vaccine for dogs and horses is about $2.50/vial. (You can buy it, but it won’t meet strict state requirements for animal vaccinations.) The CDC says humans should expect to pay $3000 for a full course of treatment after suffering a bite. So the human stuff costs at least 100 times as much, and yet it would not be tailored for canine immune systems.I’m neither a vet nor an MD so don’t take anything I say as medical advice. Human treatment always requires a visit to an MD, and canine administration should be done by a vet or you have to take all the responsibility on yourself if you do something the wrong way or there are other unwanted results. It’s better to pay a $25 fee at a pet shop vaccine clinic and be safe for yourself and for your pet.
what are the differences between asia and africa what are the similarities	what is difference between cableway and ropeway	0	The main differences I can think of are the levels and the rates of development, the population and languages.Overall, Asia is much more developed than Africa although the gap between the rich and the poor is much more stark in Asia than it is in Africa.The rates of development in Asia seem to be slowing down (although still higher) in the past few years while those of African countries seem to be rising (although still lower). GDP growth (annual %).Asia although smaller in terms of land mass, has half of the worlds population and although Africa’s is growing much faster, we are still quite far behind Asia. 2 of the worlds most populous countries, China and India are both in Asia. It is important to note however this with Africa’s much higher population growth rates and negative growth rates in parts of Asia, Africa’s population will likely be equal to Asia around 2150.Past and future population: by Continent.Most of Asia still use their traditional languages as a mode of communication and as the major official languages. In Africa, most of our official languages are those of our colonists as these make it easy for people from different ethnic backgrounds to communicate. While Asia was also colonized, many of the regions were allowed to retain their own languages.Similarities between the two are few, both regions were roughly at the same level economically at the time of getting independence, Asia managed to leverage its population allowing it to compete as a market for cheap labor that attracted investment and left Africa far behind. While there are pockets of development in Africa and pockets of underdevelopment in Asia, Asia is generally much more developed than Africa.	the difference between cableway and ropeway is that cableway is a system of suspended cables from which cable cars are hung while ropeway is a system of cables, slung from towers, from which carriers are suspended to transport materials.Both are synonymous.Reference: Cableway vs Ropeway - What's the difference?Cable wayRopeway

why is contract law important	why is maritime law so important	0	Contract law protects your rights in every agreement. Contract law makes these agreements “enforceable,” which means that it, gives you the power to compensate and obtain money for any damage caused by another party to your business and the common damage is contract breach.Contract law plays a vital role as you don’t know what the other party is planning; it may be right or may be wrong.Below outlined is the importance of contract law:A contract is a written document that describes the full understanding of the business relationship and scope of the work so that no one can claim for anything.Contracts minimize the risk.Contract law provides security and peace of mind to all the parties involved in the transaction.Contracts are the opportunity to agree to confidentiality and non-disclosure provisions that help to protect sensitive information.Various disputes and disagreements may arise between businesses, but in this case, contract help parties to compensate for their damages.However, managing contracts is a very time-consuming process for every business or law firm. So many businesses are seeking the help of contract management services to stay ahead in this dynamic market.	Maritime law, which is often referred to as admiralty law, is a fundamental branch of law that regulates commerce and navigation on the seas or other navigable waters.It covers a broad spectrum of matters such as the development of legislation, both nationally and internationally; customs and excise regulations; the fishing industry; human rights and employment issues usually relating to the crew; insurance claims; property damage; the implications of stowaways on vessels; pollution; personal injuries; wreck and salvage; piracy; and container and passenger liner matters, etc.To know more, contact Plauche, Smith & Nieset, LLC law firm.
when will moto g3 moto g 3rd gen 2015 get android  87  nougat update	how long will i get os updates on moto g3	0	I am using Moto g3 since it was available in market And i am sure it won’t be receiving this update (7.0 Android N)I have been following the news for update to Android 6.0 and i knew after receiving 6.0 it wasn’t gonna receive update for 7.0Every new update is rolled out on Nexus firstYou can check Motorola Moto G (3rd gen) for further updates and rollouts:) cheers ..EDIT : Most of the Motorola’s 2014 devices will not get the Android Nougat update. There are plenty of reasons behind this, one of them is hardware limitation! Because of Vulkan API, Android Nougat needs the Open GL 3.1 native support which is not present in most of the 2014 CPU’sHowever : I read a post here : All Motorola Devices Which Will Get Android N 7.0 Nougat update , which claims the update will be released on the following Devices:Moto G SERIESMoto G series constitute some of the best-selling devices from Motorola, the last two iterations in this series were the Moto G (3rd Gen) and the G4 (G4 plus and G4 Play) and they are the ones which will possibly get the Android Nougat update.Moto G3 DUAL SIM (3rd Gen) – XT1540Moto G (3rd gen) – XT1542/43/45 (BRAZIL AND LATIN AMERICA)Moto G (3rd Gen) –XT1550 ( ASIA AND AUSTRALIA)Moto G ( US AND VIRGIN MOBILE) – XT1548Moto G TURBO EDITION (2015) – XT1557Moto G4 Play (2016) – XT1609Moto G4 (2016) – XT1625Moto G4 PLUS (2016) – XT1644The Moto G (3rd Gen) and the Moto G4 users can possibly get an OTA at the end of December or early January.

prove that snr of power  snr of voltage sequare	do you get paid when you do fight companions on the jre or is it just for funexposure	0	This one is tricky!First you have to put the givens in the same units. Lets use milliwatts.100 mW is 100 milliwatts1000 microwatts is 1 milliwatt.Now you have signal as 99 milliwatts and noise as 1 milliwatt, so the ratio is 99.Often people mean S+N/N when they say S/N, so depending on how careful you want to be you could call this a power ratio of 100 or 99.SNR is the ratio of signal power to noise power, so that is done.We also have a definition that the signal to noise ratio measured in decibels is 10 times the base 10 logarithm of the power ratio. Log(100) is 2, so SNRdb is 20.Or 19.96…	Why does the Quora Partner Program pay you to ask questions, rather than answer?If Quora paid for answers, how would that work?Suppose Dudley Poindexter with fourteen followers answered a question with a well-researched and nuanced piece, complete with references and footnotes. His answer gets a hundred views and ten upvotes.Meanwhile, Suzy Rottencrotch with her cute profile pic and five thousand followers writes a vapid opinion piece, replete with spelling errors and questionable logic. Her answer goes on to amass five thousand views and five hundred upvotes.Who gets paid?Suzy’s answer generated more ad impressions, but isn't worth the time it took to read it. Meanwhile, Dudley’s answer is barely a blip on anyone's radar. Quora wants to generate ad revenue, especially from outside Quora itself, but it understandably doesn't want to direct outside traffic from search engines to Suzy’s work. The site would lose credibility very quickly and would be operating at cross purposes to its stated mission.And what happens if twenty other people weigh in with their answers, some of which restate Dudley’s answer, some of which contain fundamental errors, and some of which are just trolling attempts?How do you determine who should get what? And what prevents people from churning out bullshit, repetitive answers in the hopes of making a few cents?We're already seeing that with some of the questions.All of this is ignoring a much larger, more salient point: There is no shortage of people willing to answer. There is a need for more good questions. The answers on Quora do not drive the traffic. Not the internal or the external. The questions do. Without the questions, there can be no answers.

how can i get followers and comments on my blog	how can i get more follower on my blog	1	"As almost anything else on the web you can - if you wish - buy followers (I suppose you mean subscribers/member to your blog) and comments to blog posts. I have a site where I sell traffic including comments and members at http://www.webmasterstrafficcenter.com/ Anyway, I visited your blog. You got some problems, to say the least.1) The menus. They are a mess. Clean them up and make the links to to the right pages.2) There are nowhere for people to subscribe i.e. register as a member. I supose that is what you mean when you say ""followers"" because a blog is not like Facebook or Twitter, where you click a link and then you follow.Probably it's due to a setting in Wordpress. Go to general settings. Where it says ""membership"" select ""anyone can register"".If you want comments, you must write something worth commenting. From what I see on your blog I would'nt comment on any of your posts as is now.But that's me. Maybe someone else would comment. A test of Estimated Worth of novellatv.com show that you do have 3 Facebook shares. Not much but better than nothing.I've looked at your sourcecode.The title tag:<title>NovellaTV -</title> doesm't make any sense what so  ever.It says nothing about your blog. It just repeat the domain name.I found no description meta tag in your sourcecode.How do you expect people to follow you or comment when there is no clear description of what your blog is all about? To me it looks like a mess of all sorts of articles (where do you get them from?) with no clear purpose.Just like a billion other blogs on the web.If you want followers and comments you have to stand out.As it looks now, no wonder they leave quickly .... (my opinion)."	1. AdvertiseThis one is so obvious, we’re going to look at it first. Paid search, social media advertising and display advertising are all excellent ways of attracting visitors, building your brand and getting your site in front of people.2. Get SocialIt’s not enough to produce great content and hope that people find it – you have to be proactive. One of the best ways to increase traffic to your website is to use social media channels to promote your content.3. Mix It UpThere is no magic formula for content marketing success, despite what some would have you believe. For this reason, vary the length and format of your content to make it as appealing.4. Write Irresistible HeadlinesHeadlines are one of the most important parts of your content. Without a compelling headline, even the most comprehensive blog post will go unread. Master the art of headline writing.5. Pay Attention to On-Page SEOThink SEO is dead? Think again. Optimizing your content for search enginesis still a valuable and worthwhile practice. Are you making the most of image alt text? Are you creating internal links to new content? What about meta descriptions? Optimizing for on-page SEO doesn’t have to take ages, and it could help boost your organic traffic.6. Target Long-Tail KeywordsGot your high commercial intent keyword bases covered? Then it’s time to target long-tail keywords, too. Long-tail keywords account for a majority of web searches, meaning that if you’re not targeting them as part of your paid search or SEO efforts, you’re missing out.7. Start Guest BloggingBefore you say it – no, true guest blogging isn’t dead, despite what you may have heard. Securing a guest post on a reputable site can increase blog traffic to your website and help build your brand into the bargain. Be warned, though – standards for guest blogging have changed radically during the past eighteen months, and spammy tactics could result in stiff penalties.8. Post Content to LinkedInLinkedIn has become much more than a means of finding another job. The world’s largest professional social network is now a valuable publishing platform in its own right, which means you should be posting content to LinkedIn on a regular basis.9. Link InternallyThe strength of your link profile isn’t solely determined by how many sites link back to you – it can also be affected by your internal linking structure. When creating and publishing content, be sure to keep an eye out for opportunities for internal links. This not only helps with SEO, but also results in a better, more useful experience for the user – the cornerstone of increasing traffic to your website.10. Interview Industry Thought LeadersThink interviews are only for the big leaguers? You’d be amazed how many people will be willing to talk to you if you just ask them.

how do you cancel usaa auto insurance	auto insurance broker fee in california	0	The simplest way to cancel a policy is to contact them directly by phone. You’ll need to simply explain that you’d like to cancel the policy, which they will gladly accommodate. There are several valid reasons for them to pursue a couple of answers . What you, the consumer, may think is “cancelling auto insurance” may be NOT what you are wanting or needing to be done. Example.. when you sell one vehicle & still have remaining vehicle(s) on your policy… in that instance you need to have a vehicle cancelled from your policy… not “the auto policy cancelled.” Actually, in the industry - I am taking from your choice of wording (through no fault of your own!) your request is asking that you are terminating your policy, not “cancelling” it. Companies cancel coverages, vehicles, delete drivers or operators, but the semantics can become very important.They will not cross examine you.. they simply will want to assure themselves that they are honoring your request n the fashion which best accomplishes the end you seek … which may be a lot different from the words you choose to say.Another example - You may be re-locating to a different State & simply need it “transferred” to you new address (another curve ball - your new address if it is changing to get your refund to you!).OR, are you going to get a new car which will not arrive for another “few weeks.” even a month! IN that circumstance, most times you are far, FAR better off to allow your coverage to remain in force (..even for months!) than you are to cancel your coverage & then attempt to “reinstate” it in a month or two… after 6o days that usually is NEVER an available option..Reinstatement..! You must then re-apply for a new policy & meet all the new administrative requirements which can be very cumbersome & complex for you to accomplish. AND most times you lose your affiliation history which is of high importance in this day & age of auto insurance. And which usually provides you with lower rates.. thru longevity discounts or loyalty discounts!Are you now divorced & your ex was covered under this policy? Does your ex have a vehicle in their name & is it currently covered on the policy you are cancelling? Do they know you are cancelling the policy?Cancelling your auto insurance policy WILL have consequences. USAA will simply want to be certain you & others who may also be listed on this policy will not encounter UNINTENDED Consequences.BY the Way,.. All of the above actually occurred during my career. .. each of the above examples I have put forth as possible reasons a customer wanted to “cancel their insurance” - some with rather dismissive tone & demeanor were real examples. . Some in a brief note/letter mailed to me or my office. And how they are addressing the goal they wished, that which they really wanted to achieve with their auto insurance was NOT what would have been the result And there were mseveraleven more that I did not put forth above, but which would have been consequences never intended by my customer. Many times over my career I was called into the situation after the damage had already been done. In some instances I was unable to “fix” the situation .. or even restore it to where it was before the customer made the errant call or sent a brief e-mail.. or signed letter into our Corporate Customer Service Center(s).I hope all the QUORA Members make note of this Post - it may help them as they journey through their lives & interface with their auto insurance companies. Auto insurance companies do a lot of things for which they they justifiably earn criticism ! But, life is a lo simpler & easier if you do not assume they are simply stupid, invasive, unfriendly or greedy. Give them a chance to earn those labels!So - I am curious… are you wishing to cancel your USAA auto coverage in order to begin it with another carrier, concurrently with the expiry of your policy with USAA? And effective what date? Answering those few questions might provide USAA quickly with enough information to process your request & quickly accomplish what you ask, seamlessly. Hope this helps!	An agreement of compensation for specific potential future losses in replacement for a periodical payment. Insurance is intended to protect the financial well-being of an individual, company or another thing in the case of unexpected loss. There are many different kinds of insurance policy.

why have i been so angry lately	why am i so angry	0	The problem with answering questions like this is that it’s hard to give an exact answer - your life is different from anyone else’s. So I can only give you an answer based on my own experiences, and that which I have observed in others from the context of my own experiences:Emotions can be layered. In your case I suspect that you are concerned / stressed about something. This can be something external to your person, such as money or your grades. Or it can be something internal, such as a conflict (unmet expectations) between a subconscious definition of yourself (identity) and your environment.It can also be all of the above; the conflict between how you define yourself and how you perceive your environment can lead to an insecurity - not so much about who you are, but about whether you are suffering lack or loss as a result of an environment which you perceive as insufficient. This, in turn, can have a knock-on effect: you may focus more on your other shortcomings (such as money) or find that this insecurity is affecting your academic work (which you are more than capable of doing, and you know it)… thus creating more tension / stress.And because it’s so difficult to consciously articulate such a problem to yourself, you are unable to find an appropriate emotional outlet.	Irritation, anger or any other emotion has some reason behind it. It may not be an immediate cause, maybe something long ago which we can’t even think of right now. But its always linked to something or the other. Sometimes its because things are not going on as per our plan or people are not behaving as per our expectations. At times it is also because we are not behaving or acting the way we should.Our brain might also get linked to some specific emotion at some specific situation. This is known as conditioned stimulus. For instance, during my childhood, I could hear the voice of evening prayers from a nearby religious place only when i was alone at home. At other times, when there was someone, people kept talking and i didn’t notice that sound. Gradually, as I grew up whenever I heard that sound, I started feeling lonely. I noticed this only a few years ago. Though there is no reason for this emotion, but it got linked to a certain situation.Hormonal imbalances in people also lead to extremes of emotions, but that is an exception more than a norm.But I think a person should focus on gradually overcoming these emotions so that they don’t bother you anymore. I am not asking you to fake that you are perfectly normal and not at all concerned. Rather, try to find a logic. If some situation or person is not acting as per your expectation, then you need to realize that its not possible to have everything according to you. Either change the situation or change yourself. First be aware of your emotions, consciously withdraw yourself from the situation and then try to manage them. Gradually you will learn to manage them.As far as what I have learned from my life, these negative emotions harm only the person who has them. If another person is the cause of it then he may not even be aware of it, let alone be affected by it. Things like meditation, sports, yoga,etc might help as well. It helps to moderate your instincts and hence helps in overcoming negative emotions. Anyways, every emotion is some ‘chemical locha’ in the brain, so just keep cool and let it go.
how do you form a hypothesis since you have not  done any testing and do not  have any test results yet	why do people who have done master  degrees in any field advise you not to do a master 	0	How do you form a hypothesis, since you haven't done any testing and don't have any test results yet?You base yourself on existing knowledge.Just because for an hypothesis (as a general rule) to be validated it should have predictive ability (of events that are otherwise unpredictable) doesn’t mean that you're starting from the ground up.Although he wasn’t the first to say it, the saying “If I have seen further, it is by standing on the shoulders of giants” is often attributed to the great physicist, Isaac Newton.And so it is: you start with the available data and the pre-existing scientific theories, and speculate onwards from there. So for example, when Charles Darwin was writing his “On the Origin of Species” - the book we know refer to as the basis of modern day evolutionary theory, he wasn’t working in a vacuum. In fact, his grandfather - Erasmus Darwin - wrote a book in which he came pretty close to predicting natural selection, and said this:“Would it be too bold to imagine, that in the great length of time, since the earth began to exist, perhaps millions of ages before the commencement of the history of mankind, would it be too bold to imagine, that all warm-blooded animals have arisen from one living filament, which the great first cause endued with animality, with the power of acquiring new parts, attended with new propensities, directed by irritations, sensations, volitions, and associations; and thus possessing the faculty of continuing to improve by its own inherent activity, and of delivering down those improvements by generation to its posterity, world without end!”Zoonomia (1794)Science grows over time. Each hypothesis takes just a small step forward, only one step up the stairs, in the darkness (that’s why it takes decades and centuries for science to move forward - otherwise we’d have already figured out all of this stuff back in the stone age). And the best thing about these stairs? You’ve already climbed a few, and you hardly ever fall down. Most of the time, if you’re wrong, you just try out a new hypothesis, and another one, and another one, until you get it right.Then you drink champagne, or beer, or a coca cola, and you go on speculating from there. One step at a time.	Answer to this question differs to person to person.There are lots of permutation and combinations to end up on advising not to do Masters.How much scholar is that person from whom you are seeking this advice?They may be low in academic and might be struggling in doing Masters.People do Masters in order to learn more about the subject in which they are interested in. Further, they can do more research by enrolling to PhD.Ultimately it's on you if you will to do it you should.You can always get a better return than without it. At last it's up to you only. You are different from the one giving this advice.Thanks for A2A.
what are the consequences of trolling	what are some consequences of blackouts	0	Consequences can vary from site to site. But if there were real consequences, trolls would not continue to whomp around the web. Outside of the internet, you could be the one straw that broke the camel’s back, so to say. Yours could be the last words that someone reads before they take their own life. I am not saying you are responsible, because each person is responsible for their own actions, but if you did not have the screen to hide behind, how would you feel? If you told a person on the street that they are worthless and should be dead, and they immediately stepped in front of a bus, how do you think that would affect you? Could you live with the memory of seeing someone die in front of you?Frankly, I believe if you cannot walk up to a random stranger on the street and say such things to them, you should not be saying it on the internet. If that is not enough reason for you to control your craving to verbally abuse people, I doubt anything will.Thanks for the A2A.	I’m not sure if you are asking what causes a black out (or fainting) or what can happen when you black out (or faint). In any case, google vasovagal syncope.If you faint, you could fall and hurt yourself.Or, you could be taken advantage of when you were unconscious.There could be a more serious condition causing the black outs. Best to go to a doc and talk to them.
i am frightened of arvind kejriwal he may kill me what shall i do	what is the risk of selling bitcoin and accepting credit card payment	0	Over 10,000 RTI activists already murdered in India. Those were fighting against corrupt practices of Politicians and Bureaucrats. Lakhs sit back at home silently after being attacked or threatened.I know you won’t agree, In every state, city, town there are lots of illegal/criminal activities going on. Do one thing go to police station and file a F.I.R. against them, come back here and tell me:Whether this Desh Bhakt(Preferably go to BJP ruled state) police filed your F.I.R. or not?If Yes, What action they took?Have they arrested the accused?Have police stopped that illegal/criminal activity?Check whether that criminal don’t start threatening you or your family?If they threaten or Attack you, what police is doing?Or maybe police will ask you to keep quiet and sit at home silently.When 4 years old Gudiya was raped by neighbor in Delhi and her father went to police station with her to file a complaint, he was given Rs.2000/- by police constable to go away and no complaint was filed by police. Then he called AAP office and they protested after which F.I.R. was registered.Delhi police already arrested 12 AAP MLA’s on fake charges. I don’t defend them?but, do you think all criminals are in AAP which is just a 3 year old party. No criminals are in Lalu Party, Nitish Party, Malayam Party, Mayawati Party, Owaesi Party, Shiv Sena…how many MLA/M.P. of these parties have been arrested by our patriotic Modi government.CBI raid on Magsaysay award winner Kejriwal office, why not on Mulayam, Lalu, Mayawati, Yedi, Patnaik, Sheila Dikshit, Sonia Gandhi, Robert Vadra, Chitambram, Manmohan Singh, Rahul Gandhi??? Why why why only kejriwal??Congress/Mayawati/Lalu did so much corruption, why their leaders are not going to jail—-Try to think sometimes patiently, without just ignoring other person and considering him fool because he is not saying or writing what you want to read or listen.Why you have started hating Kejriwal more than Sonia, Mayawati, Laalu..?? why, not even a single corruption, murder, riot charge on him.Many won’t understand because they don’t know that they are communal, they don’t know they are blindly in love with a party and can’t see above that. (You may say some for me, but I never saw so many MLA arrested, ACB taken from Delhi Govt, So many bills null and void)We all know AAP is winning in Punjab easily and in Punjab, police will be in control of AAP. It won’t be like delhi that Kejriwal files F.I.R. against Sheila Dikshit and Moily and no action is taken. LG won’t do everything null and void. BJP/Congress etc are scared of this and daily arresting AAP MlA’s on laughable charges. It wont be a surprise if they murder someone to save their skin (Respect/Reputation/Chants)One more thing that I feel, Kejriwal is leaving delhi and will become Chief Minister of Punjab. Shisodia will look after delhi.Thank You	Yes, the credit card user can dispute the charge up to 120 days after receiving the statement that includes the transaction. Bitcoin is digital cash and charges are irreversible. This is by design and one of bitcoin’s greatest strengths, but it is also an obstacle to adoption as people are used to various forms of recourse with bank and credit card payments.
what disadvantages do apple computerslaptops have over other brands	why do so many people in america have an applebranded phone or laptop	0	Thanks for the A2A.I need to go into this with a disclaimer: I'm an edge user and I work with lots and lots of other edge users, my perspective is, at the very least, odd. That being said, here are the big disadvantages as I see them:Support costs for apple products are generally higher. The labor pool of qualified apple technicians is smaller, the training to service apple equipment is less broadly available and because of that, qualified personnel can charge a premium for their services. There are fewer off the shelf options for component repair, no competition for parts to drive cost of replacement parts down... From a support perspective, Apple has to deliver world class support themselves, because no one else is able to do it for them.Considerably less enterprise support. I manage enterprise support organizations. When we say that connecting your MacBook to the company VPN isn't supported, we mean it. We mean that no one on staff is trained on Apple products to know how to do it because out of tens of thousands of users out there, we don't have enough Mac users to justify the costs of maintaining an Apple product specialist on hand. We mean that even if something is technically possible, no one knows how to do it, and if you managed to get it to work once, when the engineers made changes to the environment, they didn't test to see if the change broke Mac compatibility before they implemented it. Enterprise support for Macs is poor for a bevy of reasons that have nothing to do with whether or not Macs are good products. Macs, in general, are available for a narrower subset of use cases than PCs. There isn't currently a dual Xeon MacPro workstation that I can hand to an engineer or 3D artist. There isn't a $200 Apple netbook that I can hand to my cousin's ten year old either. Apple only produces mid-range products at the high end of the Performance / $ spectrum.In general, Macs have higher Cost vs Performance. Dollar for Dollar, you can usually outperform (computationally) an Apple product with a non-apple product. Apple lags behind the technology curve and is slow to bring new hardware to market. HP and Lenovo already have Haswell-EP workstations in the market, but the MacPro is clunking along on Ivy Bridge chips. Broadwell-M processors will hit in non-Apple hardware Q4 of 2014 but you won't be able to buy a MacBook with a Broadwell chip in it until 1st half 2015. The new AMD Firepro workstation GPUs can be purchased today, but you can't purchase a Mac that has them built in, and you can't upgrade your current gen MacPro to use them. Considerably less customizable for specific use cases. Do you need a Xeon powered workstation with Nvidia Quadro GPUs to leverage Quadro based accelerations to your work? Sorry... Apple doesn't feel like they need to make a product for you. In fact, Apple no longer feels like they need to support any CUDA based technologies, so, if you're one of those people who likes their CUDA workflows... Apple doesn't want to make products for you anymore. There are other use cases as well where Apple has just decided they don't want to make hardware for people who have those needs.No overclocking. Intel and AMD are both onboard with the notion of manufacturing chips that have the ability to be pushed by people who need the performance. Apple doesn't put those chips in their products. Only one aesthetic choice: The Apple look. Do you want to look under the hood of your computer while you're working and see all of that technology at work while you do? Apple doesn't want you to see under the hood. No windowed cases for you. Are you excited by the look of custom loop liquid cooling systems? Brightly polished nickle plated copper heat pipes? Hand bent acrylic hardlines? Custom sleeved cabling? Color coded components? LEDs? Apple does not provide these aesthetic (and performance enhancing) options. (Okay, the LEDs don't enhance performance... except maybe the light path between the audio section of the motherboard and the rest of the board... or the LED I/O panel that makes it easier to find ports when plugging things in under your desk...)Apple makes good products. For 70% of the market (maybe more) their hardware is just fine. It's nice, well engineered hardware to do the things that it's designed to do. For many users, it's a good option. It's important to remember (after reading this lengthy rant) that for every reason not to buy a Mac there are also reasons that a person should buy a Mac. It will always depend on your specific needs. This is not an attempt at a balanced answer weighting pros-vs-cons of apple hardware, it's a list of things that you can't do with Apple hardware and it isn't exhaustive by any means. If Apple has chosen to build a product that fits your needs, it's worth considering if it is the right choice.	"Wow, lots of answers to a different question than the one you asked.  You merely asked why ""many"" U.S. folks have Apple products, not the ""most"" or the ""majority"" of folks.Apple makes nice tech that works well for 90% of consumers.  The 10% that is tech savvy and wants to tinker with their devices stay away because they want to be thought of as free and cutting edge.  Most people don't know tech, so they choose that which is easy to use.  Apple.After all, we live in a Web-centric world now, no longer a Windows-centric world.  So people get what they like, not what they are told they need to have.Apple is also a U.S. company, so it's the home brand."
what is the first moment you remember in your life	what is the very first thing you remember in your life	1	I vividly remember this incident,I was around 3 and half at time. My mother was completing her higher studies in her last semester. During the exams my aunt(Mother's Sister) used to baby sit me. As usual on the last day of my mom's exams,(While baby sitting)my aunt made me play with the Dry Battery Cells. The game was to roll the cell to and fro from my side to her's while we were sitting on the floor. Everything was going well,My naive aunt was doing a great job and I was thoroughly engaged.(The battery cell was exactly like this) But suddenly I realized,Mom is taking just too much time than usual. That was the moment of disaster,I can't really explain that moment,I took the cell(I was playing with) and threw it aiming at her head shot. It hit her hard,really really hard just above her left eye. The shot made her forehead bleed. She rushed to the hospital and got 3 stitches. The mark is still there just above her left eyebrows, It constantly rememinds me that memory. And I don't think I will ever forgot that moment!

i am 18 what should i do	what can i do when i am 18	1	This advice comes from my dad who was a Corrections Officer for 25 years. I have never been locked up and have never been in trouble with the law.Don’t accept any “gifts” when you arrive. Sometimes you won’t have everything you need such as shower shoes, soap, a toothbrush, snacks; whatever. Some inmates will try to leave you “gifts” to hold something over you. They’ll say that since they did something for you, it’s time for you to do ANYTHING for them.Continue your education. Give yourself a chance to learn something that can be used to help you when you get out. Go to college, learn a trade, get your GED. That will be a good chance to keep you from reoffending. It could also reduce your time in jail if they see you are doing your best to become a model citizen.Be ready to fight. My dad said that prison is a whole different ballgame. You have to fight to protect your food, because someone might not like your skin color, and more.Nobody is your friend behind bars. You will be in there with con artists, rapists, armed robbers, murderers, addicts, drug dealers, and worse. They will exploit you to get themselves ahead.Keep your mouth shut. Don’t tell anybody anything about what you did, don’t ask what they did, and don’t snitch. Rats don’t last long in prison and they get discovered really quickly.EDIT: STOP COMMENTING ON MY ANSWER AS IF I’M THE ONE GETTING LOCKED UP. I AM NOT GOING TO JAIL. I DID NOT ASK THIS QUESTION. IT’S VERY ANNOYING THAT PEOPLE ARE GIVING ME UNSOLICITED ADVICE THAT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH MY LIFE. I DID NOT THINK THAT SO MANY PEOPLE THOUGHT I WAS THE ONE WHO ASKED THIS QUESTION. FFS.	What are the best ways to improve my memory? I eat healthy, sleep well, and exercise. I am an engineering student, but I cannot remember the things very well.

The superstar who falls for a common girl.7. Endless love - this particular movie brings me goosebumps every time I watch it. How people meet someone like this like where ? I want to know that place !!Me : I want to have a love story like this but my love life sucks !Inner me : First you need to have one then it sucks ! ( Rolling my eyes )But this movie, it's amazing !This amazing lines is what the movie about , if you have found one don't lose the electricity :)we all should always remember this lines, Love should not be one of them ❤️8. Fault in our stars - what to say about this movie. I was crying all over for almost whole movie. But still I love the movie till eternity !Augustus Waters totally stole my heart ❤️9. The proposal - Ahh this dominating amazingly self independent woman who falls in love ahh ! Just love it !!10. My best friend's wedding - Amazing love story plus the friendship, totally worth it.11. 500 days of summer - Oh God what to say about this particular one. You all know it, but still for me the girl was really selfish.One person who loves this movie once told me that's how girls are. I argued hard that's not correct, but he had examples. He won but I didn't lose.Anyway enjoy the lines....

how realistic is it to get a second bachelors degree in math as an international student holding a first bachelors degree in accounnting	a baby lion raised domestic to the age of 4  human years can survive if he would be released in the wild	0	A2A.McGill's admissions process is quite formulaic. The admissions committee value grades and standardized test scores above all else. If you are, for instance, a Canadian student, then your high school grades will dictate whether or not you will be accepted.However, since you are an international student, your country of origin will also be a factor during admissions. A Chinese student will be assessed using a different metric than that of a French student.With that being said, since you are an A student, I think you have that front covered. A couple of B's won't necessarily hurt you as long as your grades show a trend of steady improvement. It is extremely important that you score high (>90%) on STEM courses, which will be weighted more heavily since you want to apply to CS, which is under the Faculty of Science.Sadly, McGill does not place as much emphasis on extracurriculars as other universities so your research papers may not play a significant role in admissions. However, do include it in your application as it certainly won't hurt.Remember that McGill's acceptance rate is rather high (>40%) so the odds are in your favor. They tend to give you the benefit of the doubt, and let your time at McGill determine if you will successfully graduate.Good luck.	In addition to the other answers, there’s always the persistent absence of self control. Wild animals never display anywhere near the degree of self control that average person achieves. In the wild this actually works to the animal’s advantage, speeding reaction time to near double that of a human. (We have the instinct to “think about it” when there’s no time to do so.) But this is also why a panicked pet bird like a parakeet will suddenly “panic” because of sudden sounds or movements and fly right into a wall or window, breaking its neck or sustaining other injuries.
how is it possible to believe in the old testament in which there is just one god and at the same time believe in trinity	searching practical application of 6 bit adc	0	The decision that there was a trinity was decided by a meeting of Catholic bishops and others in 325 AD. Here is a quote about the Council of Nicea:The Council of Nicea took place in AD 325 by order of the Roman Emperor Caesar Flavius Constantine. Nicea was located in Asia Minor, east of Constantinople. At the Council of Nicea, Emperor Constantine presided over a group of church bishops and other leaders with the purpose of defining the nature of God for all of Christianity and eliminating confusion, controversy, and contention within the church. The Council of Nicea overwhelmingly affirmed the deity and eternality of Jesus Christ and defined the relationship between the Father and the Son as “of one substance.” It also affirmed the Trinity—the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit were listed as three co-equal and co-eternal Persons.So a Roman Emperor (Constantine) decided 1,691 years ago what you will believe as a Christian. For me that is too much of a stretch-it has no meaning in my life.Your beliefs are not my business, or anyone else’s so don’t worry about what a few men living in the Bronze Age decided.	Many people have already addressed the question with detailed explanations. I will try to add some more clarifications regarding resolution and number of channels.ResolutionWhen in a datasheet we see N-bit ADC or N-bit DAC, N refers to the resolution. For an ADC it is the number of bits the ADC outputs at each sampling time, while, in the case of a DAC, it is the number of bits of the input.2𝑁2N2^N represents the number of levels in which the amplitude of the analog signal is divided. For instance, if N=3 there are 8 levels.The following diagram can be used for an ADC or DAC.For an ADC the red sinewave represents the analog input, while the blue curve represents the sinewave quantized with 8 levels. The 3-bit numbers associated with each level of the quantized sinewave are the digital outputs of the ADC.For a DAC, the 3-bit numbers are the inputs of the DAC. The blue curve is the analog output of the DAC before the reconstruction filter. The red sinewave is the output of the reconstruction filter.Number of channelsAs regards the number of channels, let’s assume that we have 8 analog inputs and we need to digitize them with 10-bit resolution, and process them in an FPGA.We can use 8 ADCs in parallel, one for each input. Another option is to use a single 10-bit ADC preceded by an analog multiplexer.The multiplexer has 8 inputs selected by a 3-bit control signal. Based on the value of the control signal the corresponding input is selected and sent to the ADC. The ADC produces a 10-bit output at each sampling time.Yet another option is to purchase an integrated circuit containing both the multiplexer and the ADC. In this case we need to find an 8-channel 10-bit ADC.
how should i start meditating	how should i start meditating and when	1	THE BENEFITS OF MEDITATION, AND HOW TO ADD IT TO YOUR DAILY ROUTINE.Meditation is to the mind what fitness is to the body. It’s a technique to train and improve the mind as exercise trains the body. Like exercises, there are numerous meditation techniques. However, most are categorised as the below:1) CONCENTRATION MEDITATION: Concentration meditation involves focusing on a single point. This could entail following the breath, repeating a single word or mantra, staring at a candle flame or listening to a repetitive sound. Since focusing the mind is challenging, a beginner might meditate for only a few minutes and then work up to longer durations.In this form of meditation, you simply refocus your awareness on the chosen object of attention each time you notice your mind wandering. Rather than pursuing random thoughts, you simply let them go. Through this process, your ability to concentrate improves.2) MINDFULNESS MEDITATION: Mindfulness meditation encourages the practitioner to observe wandering thoughts as they drift through the mind. The intention is not to get involved with the thoughts or to judge them, but simply to be aware of each mental note as it arises.Through mindfulness meditation, you can see how your thoughts and feelings tend to move in particular patterns. Over time, you can become more aware of the human tendency to quickly judge an experience as good or bad, pleasant or unpleasant.WHY MEDITATE?Benefits of meditating have been proven to include:- More happy feelings - Less stress- Deep relaxation- Lower blood pressure- Improved blood circulation- Lower heart rate- Less perspiration- Slower respiratory rate- Lower anxiety- Lower blood cortisol levelsThe main benefit, and aim, of meditation however is to maintain a calm mind and sense of inner harmony.HOW TO START MEDITATING:1) Sit or lie comfortably. You may even want to invest in a meditation chair or cushion.2) Close your eyes.3) Make no effort to control the breath; simply breathe naturally.4) Focus your attention on the breath and on how the body moves with each inhalation and exhalation.5) Notice the movement of your body as you breathe. Observe your chest, shoulders, rib cage, and belly. Simply focus your attention on your breath without controlling its pace or intensity. If your mind wanders, return your focus back to your breath.6) Maintain this meditation practice for three to five minutes to start. Aim to increase this and ideally be up to ten minutes within the first month.7) Schedule in daily, and make sure you are not disturbed.Ian David WorthingtonCreator, Owner and Coach at GymWolfPT.com	Find or make a room in your house for your meditation sessions. Try to keep one convenient time for your meditation and stick to it, like a routine thing. Let the room be without any furniture.Meditation can be done two ways, 1. sitting comfortably in any position (crossed legs) and 2. by walking (possibly with closed eyes).Lay a comfortable multi colored mat (of wool preferred), you may use a blanket right in the center of the room. You may bathe with luke warm water and appointed time enter the room. Sit comfortably on the mat (facing any direction eg. east, west or north or any).Close your eyes, focus on your nostrils, watch (with eyes closed) your inhalation and exhalation. Just watch the breathing, inhale belly goes out, exhale belly goes in. Just be watchful. If you cannot focus in few days, that’s okay. Let your mind wander wherever it wants to go and whatever it wants to do. Remember three things, nostrils, inhale and exhale. That’s all. Don’t force to inhale or exhale like you have to catch a flight or a bus. You have all the time in the world. Just sit be watchful of the nostril, inhale, exhale. Just be a witness.Feel the presence of your breath touching the nostrils, breath goes inside your lungs and belly goes out. Be watchful, breath energizes your body, you exhale, belly goes in and breath leaves the nostrils.Just sit like this for 15 minutes for the first fortnight or month. Increase by 5 to 10 minute thereafter. When you have gotten tired of sitting and doing this meditation, stand up and walk around the room doing the same. Breath touches nostril, breath goes in belly goes out, breath energizes the body, exhale, the breath leaves the nostril and repeat. When you get tired walking meditation, sit and meditate. That’s there is to do in this or any meditation. In the beginning you may have to do all this, one day it will all happen by itself and you will become the “non-doer”, meditation will happen, effortlessly. In the beginning it’s meditation and you, one day it will be just meditation alone, you will exist no more because you cannot identify yourself separately any more. It’s pure consciousness all around. You become the consciousness, you lose your identity.What to expect doing meditation? Nothing. All what’s been said by other Quoran’s is the byproduct of meditation. Meditation does not bring you happiness, more emotional intelligence, more energy to do your work, more sex energy, more of this or more of that and all that. These things will come to automatically because all your life you wanted them and they were running away from you. Now you have stopped running after these things so they will come back to you to entice you to sway you from your reality.Meditation does not bring anything to you except a transformation, a total transformation. You who had forgotten your trueself now you will discover your “godliness”.For example: Imagine, you are milk. Through the process of meditation you “the milk” can be transformed in to “yogurt”, that’s the end. The process cannot be reversed, it’s a one way thing. Meditation transforms you, you are not longer the milk, you are yogurt. Meditation is the art of “dying consciously” you are willing to allow the process, you the milk to die out and transform into yogurt - this a metaphor I am showing you. Milk is poison, but yogurt is very healthy (even in real life).The ultimate benefit of meditation is: how to die consciously and let go of being what you are. Meditation is the process of becoming the ultimate reality, the real you, nothing more nothing less. Just you “as is” in the truest sense, you remove the mask of being what you have been made by society for many many incarnations. Now you discover your true Self.I would like to share with you Osho on meditation. Getting started on meditation.Now you are home, welcome home.
can an infinite amount of dark or vacuum or gravitational energy be created with expansion	is the potential energy of vacuum energy virtual particles andor dark energy infinite no merge	1	The popular hypothesis on the expanding universe is partially summed up by the Big Rip (Big Rip) conjecture.We know that the universe is expanding. What is new is that there seems to be an acceleration to this expansion. If so, it will lead to some astounding dynamic events in the universe. As described in the Wiki article and in many other sites on the internet, at some point in the far future the expansion rate will become greater than the gravitational attraction of the galaxies, which will begin to move away from each other. Then galaxies themselves will diffuse and spread apart, then solar systems (which will be long dead by then), followed by stellar remnant disintegration, planetary disintegration, molecular disintegration.What happens next is still open to conjecture, but we can do a thought experiment and come up with a pretty good answer.The accelerating expansion will then pull electrons from nuclei and pull protons and neutrons from the nucleus.Now things become interesting. All the neutrons will decay to protons, electrons, and anti-neutrino within a brief time, leaving protons as the next target.But what happens when the expansion rate becomes greater than the strong nuclear force? Well, we know that the proton is made up of three quarks (two up and one down). We also know that quarks cannot exist in isolation. So what happens? The increasing expansion of the universe becomes greater than the strong nuclear force and pulls the quarks apart. This takes a great deal of energy. Where does this energy come from?As the quarks are pulled apart, they combine with virtual quark particles from the vacuum energy and form mesons; quark and anti-quark pairs. Normally, the mesons would decay very quickly (10−8𝑡𝑜10−1610−8to10−1610^{-8}to 10^{-16}) seconds, but the rate of expansion pulls the quark anti-quark pair of the meson apart before it can decay. This produces two more mesons, which produce four mesons, which produce eight, and we have an exponentially increasing creation of matter.Where does the energy come from to create all this matter? One proposed form of dark energy is that it is equivalent to the vacuum energy of space, that is, virtual particles. And dark energy is proposed as the energy of acceleration.So now we see that dark energy is being converted to matter in the form of quark anti-quark mesons and thus the amount of dark energy is reduced. If dark energy is reduced, so then is the acceleration of the universe. Eventually, we have complete conversion of dark energy to meson matter. But the expansion continues and meson matter continues to form.We can think of the initial expansion rate of the universe as inertia. The continued formation of meson matter then begins to slow down the expansion rate. But since we have an exponential growth of meson matter, the expansion rate will slow down rapidly.When the expansion rate slows enough, the mesons will then have time to decay into photons (gamma), electrons, positrons, neutrinos, and anti-neutrinos. The electrons and positrons will combine and decay into two gamma photons. So the resulting universe will consist of photons, neutrinos, and anti-neutrinos.What happens next is completely unknown and would require some clever and difficult calculations to arrive at an answer. Will the resulting expansion rate become negative? Will the significantly increased mass-energy of the universe contribute to a negative expansion (shrinking)?Lots of good things to think about here.Cheers!

is bihar really developing under mahagathbandhan sarkar	is bihar developing under the leadership of chief minister nitish kumar	0	It's too early to answer that question. Development is a very broad and slow thing. It needs time to get analysed. Wait for few more months to see the better picture. Don't miss understood announcements with Development. Every ruling party try to do something to remain in power. Making announcements and applying it are two different things. So have some patience and ask this question again after 6-7 months. You surely will get answers with stats and facts. Now is not the right time.	You have asked many questions at the same time with the theme of Bihar & development. I think the theme is in trend more or less because Bihar with some other states (BIMARU) were considered extremely poor and underdeveloped .Though times have changed but conditions haven’t changed .The way politics has become superior than any other means of change and the way negativity spread across human minds are main reasons why these states along with many countries are lagging behind . To overcome all these things we need more involvement of common people in everything.Bihar like all other states were ruled by greedy people in last 2–3 decades.{ I don’t want to name them , but you can guess very easily.}Those ministers were involved in self- advancement and thus people started migrating in search of food and money. So called Gundaraj came into existence and thus people from marginal community and women were insecured.Crime increased day by day and literacy dropped.In last 10 years many things changed and it must be changed no matter who was ruling but many things are in worst ever condition.Yes , women feel secure now .They can roam here and there all day but not in night { because there is no need for them to roam in night} but where ? Only in Patna and some other cities not in villages.Illiteracy rate :huh what do you want ? Only to read a, b c, d.. and k ,kh , g … and do some sums .That is what you want to hear then YES people are at least literate . Whole world is doing PhD and we are talking about literacy. If you wanna learn you have no other option than to go to any private school because there is nothing in government schools except food , benches and buildings. You know private schools are very few and that too are not providing education of top class while charging high amount of money.There are many villages deprived of basic amenities of modern world like electricity , hospitals ,banking , roads and water.What do you think government has no money to spend on these things and has more than $15 million {100 crores} to spend on 350th Prakash Parv. No , government have providen enough for everything . Then why things are not changing ? You know why ? Because of corrupted officers and lack of governments interest.You asked ‘Do people get better facilities ?’ I say “who the hell are they to provide facilities ? ” We need anything. We are capable of getting that thing.Prashant Kumar's answer to Can we expect all our politicians tobe well educated and understand problems of masses and find the answers?Prashant Kumar's answer to Why aren't Biharis able to build a single international cricket stadium in their state?
how can homeopathic medicine not have sideeffects	what are the side effects of homeopathic medicines	0	They do have adverse side effects when they’re prescribed incorrectly. It’s a myth that homeopathic medicines do not have side effects. [1]I was once prescribed Lachesis 1M for a left sided headache but unfortunately ended up having a severe aggravation for a week - left upper eyelid started drooping (ptosis) along with weakness of the entire left side of the body followed by fever and skin problems. When all the adverse symptoms subsided, the original left sided headache was also gone for quite a long time!In a way, these side effects are common (just like the mild fever and soreness after vaccination) but can be totally avoided with measured dosages, potency and antidotes.Footnotes[1] Medscape Log In	"The Homeopathic remedies carry great risk and damaging side effects. Refer ""Expanded work of Dr. E.B.Nash""  Preface page number xvii. It states that --The drug capable of curing, misapplied may kill instead of curing.The remedies offer cure only if used correctly. The misuse will harm beyond imagination and over use will kill.It is always advised to exercise great care during the Homeopathic treatment. Once the wrong remedy is given, the effect doesn't exhaust soon and quickly. Most of the remedies are very long and deep acting and apt to cause serious harm.Many a times I have been asked about the antidote?? The antidote may be used to neutralise or modify the effect, but the working period can never be reduced. The working period will depend upon the remedy, the potency and the quantity. According to one of the calculations a certain remedy in certain potency—one pill may work for about 600 (Six hundred) years. It would be worth to note that one drop of a liquid remedy is used for preparing 40 pills of a remedy. That means one drop will work at the rate—600x40=24,000 (twenty four thousand years)So, you can imagine the risk involved during the treatment.

how do you determine what  a good investment brokerage and what  not	which is best music player under 5000 inr	0	"Choice of broker depends on a number of factors. Do you want research? Low commissions? Low borrow rates? A reliable trading platform? Option analytics? How often are you going to trade? How many shares do you trade? Does the broker offer a paper trading account, good charting, good technical analysis? Real time news? What are the data fees, if any? Do they have reasonable borrow rates for hard to borrow stocks?Think Or Swim has superb option analytics.If you know what you are doing, you trade relatively infrequently and you are simply seeking the best commission structure, free trades are available at many brokers.If you trade large blocks of low priced shares, you'd be better off at a fixed fee broker like Tradeking @ $4.95 plus they have an account opening offer of $1,000 in free commissions (for trades in first 60 days) if you fund an account with $5,000.Optionshouse also charges $4.95 per trade.Merrill Edge offers up to 30 free trades a month.And there are others. Google ""Free Trades Broker"". Check the fine print for add'l charges (cancellation fees, modified orders, etc).If you want to scale in and out of positions, say 500, 1,000 shares, etc., Interactive Brokers charges a 50 cent commission per 100 shares ($1 minimum charge per trade) So five trades of 200 shares is the same $5 commission as one trade of 1,000 shares. Option commissions are approx 75 cts per contract (less if closing out 1 to 5 ct premiums) with free option assignment and exercise. You sometimes get rebates for providing liquidity as well.The short answer? It depends on what your needs are.For a Barrons review of brokers, see:Best Online Brokers: Fidelity Wins in Barron’s 2016 Survey"	"You should consider the Audio-Technica ATH-M40fs headphones, as well. They are an older model, but can still be found on Amazon for quite a bit under your stated budget. This model has now been replaced with the ATH-M40x, but here are the specs for the M40fs:SpecificationsType: Closed-back dynamicDriver Diameter: 40 mmMagnet: NeodymiumVoice Coil: Copper-clad aluminum wireFrequency Response: 5 - 28,000 HzMaximum Input Power: 1,600 mW at 1 kHzSensitivity: 100 dBImpedance: 60 ohmsWeight: 8.8 oz (250 g) without cableCable: 11' (3.4 m) (OFC litz wire, left-side exit)Connector: 1/4"" (6.3 mm) phone plugAnd, here are some key specs for the M40x:Output sound pressure level 98dB/mWReproduction frequency band 15~24,000Hzi didn't list, above, the non-key specs that didn't change in the spec sheets. Notice that the M40fs actually has better specs for frequency response and efficiency.While i have not personally tried the M40x models, yet, i do suspect that they sound a little better, overall, than the M40fs. The M40x has a different construction, wherein i definitely see some advantages, as well. But, i do have extensive experience with the M40fs model, as well as many other studio-grade headphones. The M40fs has a very flat frequency response, and is a phenomenal value, particularly now.Other thoughts:Sony headphones get mentioned a lot in various forums, and many people like them. i don't mind them for live audio engineering/mixing, but they tend to have a bit of a boost in the upper frequencies that increases ear fatigue and reduces accuracy in the studio.You may want to consider some high-end earbud designs, as well. Because of their physical design, low frequencies can be translated with more perceptual feeling, and the SPL at the eardrum can actually be reduced without sacrificing perceived volume. You might be impressed with some of the newer dual-driver designs, in terms of audio reproduction.Audio-Technica is a great brand that i recommend frequently. They typically don't upcharge for their brand name, unlike Sony, Shure, Monster, etc."
what is the scope of supply chain management in india	what is the future scope for procurement logistics operations and supply chain management	0	Frankly speaking, there is a huge scope.Supply Chain Management (SCM) or commonly we can say Logistics is the crucial part of any business related to goods. Supply chain is a whole network which creates the bridge between the producer and the customers.Supply Chain Network:• Vendors supply raw materials• Producers convert those raw materials into products• Warehouses store that product until it’s needed• Distribution centres pick up and deliver that product• Retailers, online and in-store, bring that product to youSupply Chain Management is the rib of any business, hence it’s very responsible career opportunity. To increase your knowledge and before selecting SCM as your career option, search Counsil of Supply Chain Management Professionals.Starting Your Supply Chain Management Career	If you are doing degree just to get job then, no degree would be worth. You will just enter into a field because its lucrative, burn yourself out for incentives and pay packages and one fine day you will realize that whatever you have done is worth a number in bank account, that's it.Try to evolve in a field which is of your liking.Speaking of Supply Chain Management, It is very good field in terms of Job as well as business prospects, you will get Good remuneration and along with that Global exposure and networking.The field is diverse in which you will get chance to work on product which weighs in grams like FMCG as well as which weighs in Tons like shipping. You can get a chance to work in forests, mines, offshore rigs, cosmopolitan cities....and list goes on and on.You can get into consulting, projects, strategic planning, production planning, capacity management......If the field really interests you, its worth entering.
are the number of pistons equal to number of number of cylinders	how do i join wikileaks	0	It tells the capacity of the engine the car has.For starters : 1 Litre = 1000 cc (cc means Cubic Centimeters or cm^3)So a 1.2L car is:1.2×1000= 1200 ccLikewise a 1.4 L car has a 1400cc engine;and so on.Also note that if a 1.2L car has a 4 cylinder engine, it means each cylinder's capacity is 1200÷4 = 300 ccVolume of a cylinder is :(π(D^2)h)÷4where D is the diameter of the cylinder called Bore Diameter and h is the height of the cylinder called Stroke Length.Thus when you calculate the volume of each cylinder of a 4 cylinder 1200cc car, using the above formula by measuring the bore and stroke yourself you'll end up getting 300cc or some no. very close to 300cc since π isn't an absolute no.Now for the technical part :How does that matter?Well the performance of an engine (Horsepower, Torque, Acceleration, etc.) depends upon how much fuel it can burn when the Piston inside the cylinder reciprocates once; i.e. when it moves from the topmost point of the cylinder called Top dead center (T. D. C.) to the lowermost point of the cylinder called the Bottom dead center (B.D.C.).Here's an image I sourced from the Internet :But there's a catch. You can't add an infinite amount of fuel because you need air to burn this fuel, lest the fuel remains unburnt and comes out of the exhaust and deposits on the tailpipe (The greasy deposits which you might have seen especially on tailpipes of obsolete 2-stroke two wheelers is this unburnt fuel).Thus, to get more performance you need to burn more fuel and to burn more fuel you need to suck in a lot of air into that cylinder. One simple way of doing this is to have a larger capacity cylinder which will have a higher capacity to hold air and thus can burn more fuel giving a better performance.However, be warned that a bigger engine also means that it will be less fuel efficient. Since it has to burn a definite amount of fuel to keep running it will consume more fuel even at low speeds when you don't really need that performance.Other ways are also prevalent to increase performance but this is the most primitive way of doing this.However newer ways like turbocharging or increasing the compression ratio by using direct injection (D. I.) are far better methods because they do not compromise much on fuel efficiency.Thus Bigger engine = Better engine doesn't really hold true nowadays with improved technologies that has made smaller engines more powerful while at the same time being fuel efficient!	The are four steps to becoming a spy for RAWGet RealisticMeet the Basic and Advanced CriteriaApplyGo through vettingR&AW's Motto: The law protects when it is protected.The most important qualification to become a spy The first thing is you must realise if you are going to become a  spy is that the things you see spies doing in films and on television or  read about in novels are not even slightly realistic. You will not kill  people. You will not drive fast cars. You will not seduce attractive  foreigners. You will not defuse bombs with only seconds to spare. For  many intelligence roles you probably won't even get a gun.Most people realise that  James Bond and Jason Bourne are not realistic, but even supposedly realistic spies, like the ones  John Le Carré writes about, are not much like real spying.Here’s what Somerset Maugham, who was a spy for MI6, said about being a real spy in his novel  Ashenden:   The work of the agent in the Intelligence Department is on the whole extremely monotonous. A lot of it is uncommonly useless. One movie that was quite realistic (although about MI5 not R&AW) was   Complicit. It might be worth watching that. So, let’s summarise the most important lesson about becoming a spy:  there will be no guns, no fighting, no fast cars and no sexy foreign  agents. Instead there will be lots of normal, boring hard work, like any  job.Are you sure you want to do this? Basic Criteria Still here? Right, let’s talk about how to become an intelligence officer for R&AW.   Remember   Intelligence agencies have lots of other roles besides intelligence  officer. Translators, analysts, and IT work are less glamorous, but just  as vital.  Basic requirements to become a spy    Don’t get in trouble with the law.   Any criminal record is likely to end your application.    Don’t do drugs.   Drug tests are often given to applicants. Drug addiction is not tolerated.    Go to university.   Most intelligence  organisations including R&AW expect their officers to have a good education.    Be ready to travel.   Most spies have to travel to foreign countries. There are roles without travel but you will limit your chances.    Be a citizen.   You must be a citizen of your country and so must the rest of your close family. So those are the basic criteria. But getting a job in intelligence is  very competitive. So you need to do more to stand out. Here’s a few suggestions: Advanced Criteria Learn a foreign language      Preferably the language of your country’s enemies. Even better, learn a  relatively obscure language – you will have less competition.  Do some sport.   Being fit won't do any harm, and it looks good on your CV.  Don’t tell your friends you’re applying.   Spying is about being discreet. If you can't keep your friends unaware, then you aren't going to make it.  Show you can work long hours.   Get a job that demonstrates your discipline and commitment. Being a spy is not a 9-5  job. Often a case really is a matter of life and death and you won't be  able to go home until it is resolved. Show leadership.   Military service might be an advantage here or some other leadership position. Don't hide anything.   If you dabbled with drugs once or have a minor conviction they will find out, and if you try to hide it they will think you’re unreliable and untrustworthy. Keep out of debt.   Some debt is OK, but don't show any sign of financial irresponsibility, you could be vulnerable to pressure or bribery. ApplyThe Research and Analysis Wing doesn't have a website, so it’s harder to apply to become a spy for them. However, jobs advertised as   Deputy Field Officer, Cabinet Secretariat, Government of India are thought to be recruiting for R&AW. Otherwise entrance through the   National Academy of Administration may be possible.VettingThe application process for an intelligence officer position ...

can we control our actions in a dream	can we control our dreams can we dream what we wanna dream about	1	"Yes.This is not fiction/non-proven(like telekinesis or telepathy) stuff. Dream controlling is real, and is studied by scientists.The term for it is Lucid Dreaming.The thing is, while you are dreaming, your brain simulates the reality. But it is not very good at doing it. However, most people still can't differentiate between dreams and reality because after all, its your brain that's tricking you, you can hardly help it.So, you use clues to get out of your minds traps.Simply put, there are many things that happen in a weird way in dreams. One example is, while you are dreaming, if you look at your hands, you will never see 10 fingers! (When I lucid dream, I usually see 2 pinkies, and sometimes my hands have so many fingers that I lose count while counting them.)If you try to read text in your dream, shift your focus away, and look again at the text, the text is very likely to change.If there is a tube-light shining, or a phone ringing, your actions of switching off the light, or picking up the phone will very likely cause no change, and the light will continue to shine, the phone will continue to ring.There are many other clues.So, if you make a habit of looking at your hands and counting your fingers every 20 minutes or so, your brain will start performing the action subconsciously. Then one night, you will end up looking at your hand, while you are dreaming. And you will count less or more fingers than you have. That means you are in a dream, and you know you are dreaming.Once you know you are dreaming, you can exert control over your surroundings, and even the way your dream progresses, but that is not for the absolute beginner.With practice, you can even personify your subconscious, and talk to it! It will tell you your deepest desires, it will let you relive the best moments of your life and much more. (ofcourse theres stuff like changing your surroundings, flying, having sex that you can do, but it gets boring after a while. Talking to your subconscious is really difficult, and is an enlightening experience)Lucid Dreaming can be used for many purposes including practicing things, creating your mind palace, solving problems and deriving creative inspiration.If you wish to read more about the topic, simply Google ""Lucid Dreaming"". There are loads of good websites dedicated to the topic, and you will find a handful of research papers.In response to the question posted in comments:Have you ever done this? How far have you gotten? How long did it take you? The answers to your questions are at the bottom.The following is how I got started with Lucid Dreaming.This post is long, and I am a bad writer, so please bear with me :(Let me tell you my story, but first you need to learn some trivia.Human sleep is a peculiar phenomenon, in which the brain simulates the environment, and you do your job. Dreams are very imperfect, can change suddenly but seem very real from the inside.Human sleep has many phases, each one has a distinguishable brainwave frequency band. The phase in which you dream is called Rapid Eye Movement (REM), and as the name suggests, your eyeballs move when you are dreaming (you can look at a persons eyes and tell if he is dreaming or not)While in REM, your brain puts you into a temporary paralysis, so that you don't end up enacting your actions in real life (like if you walk in your dream, you wont end up walking in real life)This is called sleep paralysis.Now, my story.I used to have weird dreams, and some repeating nightmares. As a kid I was always interested in weird stuff like hypnotism, UFOs, telepathy, telekinesis and the likes, but had zero knowledge about anything.So, my school library recruited a hobbyist librarian, whom I became friends with, and seeing my interests he handed me a book on UFO and alien abductions.Turned out, the book was not filled wi..."

Talking to your subconscious is really difficult, and is an enlightening experience)Lucid Dreaming can be used for many purposes including practicing things, creating your mind palace, solving problems and deriving creative inspiration.If you wish to read more about the topic, simply Google ""Lucid Dreaming"". There are loads of good websites dedicated to the topic, and you will find a handful of research papers.In response to the question posted in comments:Have you ever done this? How far have you gotten? How long did it take you? The answers to your questions are at the bottom.The following is how I got started with Lucid Dreaming.This post is long, and I am a bad writer, so please bear with me :(Let me tell you my story, but first you need to learn some trivia.Human sleep is a peculiar phenomenon, in which the brain simulates the environment, and you do your job. Dreams are very imperfect, can change suddenly but seem very real from the inside.Human sleep has many phases, each one has a distinguishable brainwave frequency band. The phase in which you dream is called Rapid Eye Movement (REM), and as the name suggests, your eyeballs move when you are dreaming (you can look at a persons eyes and tell if he is dreaming or not)While in REM, your brain puts you into a temporary paralysis, so that you don't end up enacting your actions in real life (like if you walk in your dream, you wont end up walking in real life)This is called sleep paralysis.Now, my story.I used to have weird dreams, and some repeating nightmares. As a kid I was always interested in weird stuff like hypnotism, UFOs, telepathy, telekinesis and the likes, but had zero knowledge about anything.So, my school library recruited a hobbyist librarian, whom I became friends with, and seeing my interests he handed me a book on UFO and alien abductions.Turned out, the book was not filled wi..."
how did you managed long distance relationship	how can long distance relationships be successful	0	If you can pull it off, it can be the best thing that can ever happen to you.To answer your question, the secret for us was simple, “You dont think too much about it.”I stayed in a long distance relationship for over 3 years as I was in the US and my girlfriend was in India. We had been dating for just over a year and a half before I left for the US.I think the biggest challenge we faced like everyone else was lack of communication considering the time difference which was about 11 hours. I would wake up to her Facetime calls and they would just be 5 minutes long on an average. But those 5 minutes every day for 3 years went a long way for us. There were days when both of us would be busy, making it extremely difficult for us to talk but for the most part we made it a point that we talked for those 5 minutes.And I think that was it, there were no trust issues or insecurities between the two of us. Neither was there ever a thought of us not being together, even when we did not know if our families would approve of our relationship if and when we decide to get married ( yes, coming from India, family approval will always have extreme importance, atleast it did for us ). To add more context, for the first couple of years I was not even sure if I would be going back to India or staying in the US. Infact, a few of our friends asked us individually if we would want to stay in a relationship considering how easily they break apart for a lot of people. Inspite of these and a lot of other things, we realised the best way is to take things as they come and not dwell too much over it. Once you accept that, it will become a lot easier.And beyond that, I guess both of us got really lucky to have found each other (that is a story for another time, though) and that in the end it worked out really well for us.We completed 6 years of our relationship few months back. We got married almost a year back. We are closer than ever before, we never fight, (apart from the usual fight that starts with ‘me forgetting the towel on the bed’ and ends at ‘her not managing her finances well’) and we never take each other for granted (well I do sometimes. but she makes sure I realise that every single time.)But yeah, thats it! Think if you truly love someone you will figure out a way against all odds. Have faith.Hope that helps!P.S: thats us in the picture.Edit 1: Thank you everyone for the response. Its not a big deal, honestly. It is like losing weight, if you are too conscious about it, you will give in someday, but if you take it up as a part of your daily routine, its not a huge deal, really. Attaching some more pictures as per requests in comments. Again thank you everyone for the kind words and upvotes :)	"...and my long distance girlfriend asks me to answer this question. Michelle and I have had a long distance relationship for almost two years now. At the end of this month I'll be moving in with her, closing the three hundred mile gap that's been between us to zero. I can't wait.Here's how we did it, in no particular order:Be in each other's presence as often as possible. For us, that was an average of once a month for a weekend. That's rough, but better than nothing. I had many different coping mechanisms for this, and not all of them were healthy. A lot of self reflection and incredible patience from Michelle got me over the hump.Face time. If you can't be with each other, see each other. The webcam is a wonderful thing, use it. Google hangouts, Skype, whatever. Being able to share a smile, a goofy wink, blowing kisses, or just to stare in each other's eyes can not be understated.Phone time. If you can't be with each other or see each other, talk. As often as possible. Just hearing the other person's voice can do wonderful things to your psyche. Michelle and I would read Quora answers to each other.Patience. Your going to need a lot of this, and it's going to have to go both ways. I lack in patience. This had a tendency to make things more difficult than they needed to be. Don't be me.Understanding. Man, this long distance stuff is tough, isn't it? Always moping around, trying to ""find the time"" to get your stuff done and still spend some quality ""cam time"" together. All the stress, all the pressure. You do realize it's tough on your significant other too, right? Right? Sometimes, you just need to shut up and let your love vent their frustrations. Don't judge. Don't make it personal. Just listen and understand.Don't turn off your emotions. I did this. It was one of my coping mechanisms and it hurt Michelle and stunted my emotional well being. It sure seemed easier to shut down and not pine and mope and miss Michelle, but it's not. Don't do it.Communicate. Hey look, something else I struggled with. I had a thirteen year relationship with an alcoholic before Michelle, and quite honestly, I think I forgot how to communicate in a healthy relationship. Don't be me. Keep those lines of communication open and express yourself and your feelings.Love, unconditionally. Easy to say, harder to do. Relationships can be hard enough, long distance relationships even harder. Don't muck it up with a bunch of ifs ands or buts. Just love. That's why you're here in the first place.I can tell you without any hesitation that Michelle held this relationship together better than I did, and I'm thankful. I love her with all my heart and can't imagine where we'd be if she had let my stubbornness, my temper and many other flaws get in the way. I'm going to return the favor and A2A Michelle so you can see how to really make a long distance relationship work. Even with a putz like me.I love you, baby."
what are the chances that i could just ask a rich person for a million dollars and actually have them give it to me	i am 26 and just hit 4 million dollars i am shooting for 40 by 35 am i wrong thinking that living in the most expensive area of the country will give me better opportunities	0	My answer Where did you ever get this crazy idea from? I am also saying that if you can sit back with a bold enough face to ask people to give you $5 million dollars US, just like that, you don't deserve even $1. There are a number of these insane questions appearing on Quora, and I believe its a small number of people asking the same crazy questions and changing up the wording to let it appear that many people are of this mind set. First it was $1 million ,now it has ‘sky rocketed” to $5 million. It is my belief that you are very idle to think that someone who work or invest or even win the lotto would make you an instant millionaire. I have seen people who are physically challenged working. I mean people in wheel chairs, people missing an arm or a leg, or both, people with limited sight, or no sight at all and worse. I suggest that if you have so much time on your hand to idle, try start a small business .It could a brick and mortar one, or one on the internet, and you would stand a better chance, if you were to ask for funding to expand your business, rather than asking for free hands out. I would be embarrassed to even to think of, let alone posting a question like this. Finally If you are dreaming, wake up.	Birds of a feather flock together, there's nothing wrong with living in an expensive area, you will have access to greater business opportunities, hang out with higher level thinking, financially motivated individuals, have access to inside information that you wouldn't of have if you lived in a middle class area. The security will be better, your house will look nicer, the views will be better, the girls will be hotter.I couldn't think of a reason not to do it besides some stupid religious guilt or irrational humbleness. You earned this money by providing value to others and you must of provided a lot of value for you to hit that kind of money. There's nothing wrong with living in an expensive area as long as you manage your money wisely and if your goal is to hit for 40 by 35 then having access to the resources and opportunities that a richer area affords will be exactly what you're looking for.
what happened to hong kong movies and tv drama why did they decline so much	will british citizens be allowed to move to the eu and live there after brexit happens	0	Hongkong did not decline. It went home!Before 1997, the Hongkong entertainment industry was the Chinese entertainment industry. Talents from all over China and the Chinese diaspora fled to Hongkong and settled there—from producers and directors to actors and singers—refugees of the Sino-Japanese War, the Chinese Civil War, the Communist Revolution, the Great Leap Backwards, the Cultural Revolution, the Vietnam War, and the anti-Chinese pogroms in Malaya, which became Malaysia and Indonesia.Entertainers worked very hard, usually both singing and making movies. There were many sources of funding, initially from the underworld laundering money, but as the industry itself matured and the economy in general grew, the ecosystem grew. While Mainland China was still figuring out its life in general and Taiwan was under martial law, Hongkong represented the Chinese world.The British were very hands-off in regulating the industry. In fact, the most significant thing they did was enforcing movie subtitles in proper English, which helped with its distribution worldwide.Within a decade of the rétrocession of Hongkong to China, the industry players all looked north for bigger budgets and bigger audiences. The logic was simple: same amount of work, much bigger return.China had finally grown up, and it was time for the Chinese film industry to go home.The side effect is that the remaining entertainers in Hongkong are not world class anymore, so they don't get much attention outside of Hongkong. The ones that make it big move North or abroad.	No. UK citizens are going to require visas when travelling to France.Currently the French government and are drafting a law preparing emergency measures for a hard Brexit or the no-deal Brexit.Though not yet debated, the draft law contains following clauses:1. With no-deal Brexit crisis, UK citizens become third nation citizens and will be obliged to have a visa to come to France and a carte de sejour to stay;2. UK citizens currently legally employed in France by a French employer could be asked to obtain a work permit, as required by any foreign workers, to avoid the employer being taken to court for having non-authorised workers under the Code du Travail and3. The no-deal Brexit crisis will lead to reintroduction of controls on goods and passengers to and from the UK. Animal and vegetable goods from UK will have to undergo veterinary and phytosanitary checks at EU borders.My thanks to Kim Willsher for her additional information.Thank you for your requested answer Simon Holledge .
did trump win the election	does donald trump have any chance of winning the forthcoming election	1	If you don’t understand how Trump could win before Nov. 8th, I totally understand you.If you still don’t understand how Trump won now, you have a serious arrogance and ignorance problem.I would assume you, the reader to this answer, live in a urban area in either Northeast or the West Coast, college educated, a typical left-wing supporter and advocator for your entire life.That’s nice. You work in the office with HVAC on 24/7/365. You go to gym after work, watching news from CNN or NBC on the treadmill. Then you eat your dinner out somewhere with a friend, probably not cooking at home. Sometimes you fly between NYC/Boston and LA/SFO for business. When you look down from the plane window and see those endless farmlands and mountains in the midwest, you are thinking “I can’t imagine living a life down there.”When you saw Trump won, you were shocked. Holy shit! There’s not a single person around me who supports Trump, how could he win?That’s where the problem is. You are living in a completely different world than those Trump supporters.When you refuel your car, have you ever wondered where the gas comes from, if not imported? Who drilled the oil for you?When you charge your phone, have you ever wondered where the electricity comes from? Who dug the coal to power the plant?When you shop in the supermarket, have you ever wondered where the fresh vegetables and fruits come from? Who drove the truck all the way from California to New York to deliver those goods?Those are the people who support Donald Trump. Have you ever talked to any one of them?Without you, they can still feed themselves, but without them, you will be starved to death. You don’t know how to grow crops, and you dare not to kill a chicken.So now how could you despise them as “uneducated redneck racists”?When they watch the news, even when watching Fox News, the camera is always on the big cities far away from them. They are ignored, as if they don’t exist in this country. No one pays attention to them, and no one speaks for them, until Donald Trump.They could drive a truck for $8k a month 20 years ago working 60 hours a week, but now the illegal immigrants are willing to do it at $3k. They lost their jobs.They could work in a factory for $4k a month 20 years ago, but now the job goes to China and Mexico when the workers there make $500 a month. They lost their jobs.You can’t urge a 40-year-old man with a high school diploma having a family to raise to go to college again and learn programming or investment banking. He can’t and he can’t afford.You also can’t say in 10 years robots are doing the job for them and they should just vanish because their minds and skills don’t follow the era.They are human beings. They are also lovely nice people. They don’t hate you. They work hard so you can live a comfortable life. Why do you hate them? Why do you label them as racist deplorables and xenophobic bigots without even knowing how hard their lives are?When they are losing jobs and falling into poverty, they don’t know what to do. They stay at home and turn on the TV and see Obama and Hillary speaking on ABC News: “The biggest problem our society now facing is climate change.”They may voted for Obama 8 years ago and hoped him to bring change to their life, but they could only sigh when they see this. So they switch to Fox News and see Donald Trump speaking on his rally in Detroit, MI: “We need to rebuild our inner cities, we need to bring jobs back.” They follow him and say: “YES! Let’s make America great again!”When they saw Obama visiting NYC after hurricane Sandy in 2012, but was playing golf when the devastating flood in Louisiana destroyed thousands of homes this summer, they knew they were forgotten.However, when they saw Trump visiting Louisiana after the flood, a state that he didn’t need to campaign at all, they knew someone actually cared for them.If you are them, who will you vote for?They are the silent majorities. They live in your flyover states. They don’t care about LGBT or BLM. They are not racist or homophobic. They just want jobs to feed their families.Please throw away your arrogance and start to care about those people. They are Americans too. They might be more American than you are, since many of your clients and customers are foreign.They have no methods to let you hear them. All the medias don’t speak for them, all the celebrities don’t pay attention to them. All the career politicians don’t represent them. The only weapon they have are their ballots. They vote to knock you out of your utopia. That’s the power of democracy. That’s why democracy is great. It never ignores anyone.If you believe your value is progressive and right, you need to help them getting out of their trouble first. You can’t blame and mock them. It will only push them away from you even more.Trump has been a democrat longer than republican in his life. He has married 3 times, agrees with progressive income tax, has been pro-choice in most of his life and pro-LGBT all the time. The only hardcore conservative thing I can think of him is anti-alcohol. However, he could still defeat 16 truly conservative republican candidates and won more votes in the primaries than anyone else in the history. This has already proven that the silent majorities are much more tolerant now on social issues. They just want someone to fix the economy for them.Now it’s your chance to work with them, help them under the 4 years of Trump’s presidency. Stop protesting and introspect yourself. Isn’t your arrogance and ignorance that brought Trump to the White House?	Crosspost from U.S. Presidential Elections: Is Donald Trump likely to win the 2016 election? due to similarity of question.No. It is highly unlikely that ANY candidate can win the Presidency in modern America without much support from:HispanicsBlacksWomenYouthTrump has actively alienated each of these groups at some stage of his campaign, and in many cases multiple times. He has even made alienation of some of these groups a staple of his campaign. This has made Trump perhaps the most unpopular presidential candidate among non-whites in modern American history.The following favorable-unfavorable ratings are from November 8, 2015, so the ratings are likely even worse today than they were at the time given the level of discourse from Trump since then.Even the GOP understood that they must garner support from minority groups during the 2016 election cycle in order to stand a chance. See: 6 Big Takeaways From The RNC's Incredible 2012 AutopsyTrump essentially tore up the GOP's 2016 playbook, doused it in gasoline, set it on fire, then pissed on it for good measure.Trump's primary success is almost exclusively due to his appeal to white, (mostly male) disaffected nationalists - a particularly angry and vocal subset of the GOP base. While this group may be not only sustainable, but effective for the Republican Primary, it is a death sentence for any candidate's general election hopes. The changing demographics in the US simply don't favor him. There are simply not enough white nationalists (overt racists and/or borderline racists) out there to carry a candidate like Trump to victory.I predict that Trump will attempt to pivot and alter his message during the general election being the shapeshifter that he is, but I don't see that being a successful strategy. Unlike his current base of supporters who appear to be immune to rampant, pathological lying, general election voters have already seen through his bullshit and will not be so easily swayed by his shifting rhetoric.

why does the caste system still exist in india	why does the caste system exist in india even after 7 decades of independence	1	A friend of mine works in the Army Medical Corps. Which usually means she is a well paid nurse with a ‘Lieutenant’ attached to her name and she gets to know how differently men of different services hit on her. It also means that she is invited to officers only parties in fancy restaurants very often. One such ball was being hosted in a very expensive hotel in Kolkata and she had a +1 invite. Her not having a boyfriend and me being her best friend’s cousin automatically qualified me for the position. After being super excited for an hour and deciding on our itinerary she texted - “you cannot come”.WHAAAT??!!She expanded “only officers can come”. OK, I said. She added “only male officers can bring their civilian partners”.WHAAAT??!!I don’t exactly remember what I said after that but it should be along the lines of “those sexist grunts” or “oppressive custards” and probably “soldiers deserve respect too”. I’m not going to discuss the rigidness of hierarchy in the Indian Armed Services because I am deeply grateful for what they have done and know that this is probably what got us through all the wars with substandard equipment and zero preparedness. Ben might want to comment on this. But I feel bad for the 3,50,000 soldiers. Those men on the ground who march around with rifles, work for menial salaries and get subpar treatment. Maybe this is what keeps them under control. Maybe this is what enables them to execute suicidal orders or not think about Coups. Maybe this is discipline.But this is only an extension of the Indian Society at large which has rigid Hierarchies.The old look down on the young. Men look down on women. Rich look down on poor. The wise look down on the uninitiated. We are far from an egalitarian society. It means that my importance in society dictates how I treat you. Just because I hold an engineering degree I will reject any technical opinion from you and if you are 10 years old, I will take offence for your high degree of sarcasm. Is that fair? NO. But sadly, that is what I have been seeing my entire life. They are not obvious lines only visible under duress.Its sometimes based on privilege sometimes on the sense of achievement. But people want to maintain themselves high up in the social order to feed there sense of importance. Often it goes beyond that and controls the distribution of resources too. And Caste is just another way to do it.——————————————————————————————Its not just a linear hierarchical order - its a whole multi dimensional tree, with branches and leaves. Upper castes look down upon lower castes no doubt but even across a single level, different castes hold stereotypes and often do not intermarry. The Jats (a martial clan) are supposedly brash and Baniyas (tradesmen) are cunning, for example. People still cling on to their family names which are instant giveaways of their caste - Sharma for example is an obvious clergy name. And that only makes it easier for people to practice caste.At the receiving end of this system are Scheduled Castes and Tribes who form 20% of India’s population. Don’t get me wrong, any kind of prejudice (positive or negative) is wrong but its the SC/ST crowd which suffers the most. They are systematically segregated and oppressed. The worst part is that most of it is legal:Matrimonial classifieds are sorted by caste. We grow up watching this and do not take this seriously. We think its only natural to marry into your own caste. Because of this there is no intermingling or assimilation of the communities, reinforcing the divide. This legal structure is necessary because we need people to be identified by caste to avail them Reservations (Affirmative Action). Its like being stuck between a rock and a hard place. If you altogether outlaw caste based identity, the SC/ST will be completely overrun in the free market which would only enforce stereotypes about the poor while people still keep track of caste behind closed doors. This vicious cycle of stereotyping, oppression and deprivation will continue like it had before untouchability was abolished.But the primary reason Caste system still exists is public apathy. Reservations has caused a feeling of resentment among forward castes. They think that giving away seats in public sector jobs and higher education to the downtrodden is taking away the seats they deserve. This has only reinforced age old stereotypes. There are states in India where people have voluntarily given up caste names, only making use of it while seeking marriage alliances or applying for reservations. But those are results of bloody social revolutions while people in other states shamelessly carry on with their caste stereotypes.There are people who do not invite SC/ST inside their homes, who refuse to eat or drink from their place. There are people who would physically assault them over petty reasons. There are people who then call them “undeserved” for availing reservations and then there are people who believe there are biological differences between castes. These people lack common empathy and believe that what’s wrong with the oppressed is none of their business. They fail to realize that the lineage they are so proud of comes from stealing from these folks.Things are definitely changing - especially in the urban middle class crowd. But we still have a long way to go. Especially since there are too many people who hold the aforementioned views. There is an influx of ideas and people on the whole are growing more accepting. The caste hierarchy is being replaced by a consumeristic one which is still better than what we have.(suggested by User-13331186939230997432 :P)images from:Dalit Netwerk Nederland (DNN)	A friend of mine works in the Army Medical Corps. Which usually means she is a well paid nurse with a ‘Lieutenant’ attached to her name and she gets to know how differently men of different services hit on her. It also means that she is invited to officers only parties in fancy restaurants very often. One such ball was being hosted in a very expensive hotel in Kolkata and she had a +1 invite. Her not having a boyfriend and me being her best friend’s cousin automatically qualified me for the position. After being super excited for an hour and deciding on our itinerary she texted - “you cannot come”.WHAAAT??!!She expanded “only officers can come”. OK, I said. She added “only male officers can bring their civilian partners”.WHAAAT??!!I don’t exactly remember what I said after that but it should be along the lines of “those sexist grunts” or “oppressive custards” and probably “soldiers deserve respect too”. I’m not going to discuss the rigidness of hierarchy in the Indian Armed Services because I am deeply grateful for what they have done and know that this is probably what got us through all the wars with substandard equipment and zero preparedness. Ben might want to comment on this. But I feel bad for the 3,50,000 soldiers. Those men on the ground who march around with rifles, work for menial salaries and get subpar treatment. Maybe this is what keeps them under control. Maybe this is what enables them to execute suicidal orders or not think about Coups. Maybe this is discipline.But this is only an extension of the Indian Society at large which has rigid Hierarchies.The old look down on the young. Men look down on women. Rich look down on poor. The wise look down on the uninitiated. We are far from an egalitarian society. It means that my importance in society dictates how I treat you. Just because I hold an engineering degree I will reject any technical opinion from you and if you are 10 years old, I will take offence for your high degree of sarcasm. Is that fair? NO. But sadly, that is what I have been seeing my entire life. They are not obvious lines only visible under duress.Its sometimes based on privilege sometimes on the sense of achievement. But people want to maintain themselves high up in the social order to feed there sense of importance. Often it goes beyond that and controls the distribution of resources too. And Caste is just another way to do it.——————————————————————————————Its not just a linear hierarchical order - its a whole multi dimensional tree, with branches and leaves. Upper castes look down upon lower castes no doubt but even across a single level, different castes hold stereotypes and often do not intermarry. The Jats (a martial clan) are supposedly brash and Baniyas (tradesmen) are cunning, for example. People still cling on to their family names which are instant giveaways of their caste - Sharma for example is an obvious clergy name. And that only makes it easier for people to practice caste.At the receiving end of this system are Scheduled Castes and Tribes who form 20% of India’s population. Don’t get me wrong, any kind of prejudice (positive or negative) is wrong but its the SC/ST crowd which suffers the most. They are systematically segregated and oppressed. The worst part is that most of it is legal:Matrimonial classifieds are sorted by caste. We grow up watching this and do not take this seriously. We think its only natural to marry into your own caste. Because of this there is no intermingling or assimilation of the communities, reinforcing the divide. This legal structure is necessary because we need people to be identified by caste to avail them Reservations (Affirmative Action). Its like being stuck between a rock and a hard place. If you altogether outlaw caste based identity, the SC/ST will be completely overrun in the free market which would only enforce stereotypes about the poor while people still keep track of caste behind closed doors. This vicious cycle of stereotyping, oppression and deprivation will continue like it had before untouchability was abolished.But the primary reason Caste system still exists is public apathy. Reservations has caused a feeling of resentment among forward castes. They think that giving away seats in public sector jobs and higher education to the downtrodden is taking away the seats they deserve. This has only reinforced age old stereotypes. There are states in India where people have voluntarily given up caste names, only making use of it while seeking marriage alliances or applying for reservations. But those are results of bloody social revolutions while people in other states shamelessly carry on with their caste stereotypes.There are people who do not invite SC/ST inside their homes, who refuse to eat or drink from their place. There are people who would physically assault them over petty reasons. There are people who then call them “undeserved” for availing reservations and then there are people who believe there are biological differences between castes. These people lack common empathy and believe that what’s wrong with the oppressed is none of their business. They fail to realize that the lineage they are so proud of comes from stealing from these folks.Things are definitely changing - especially in the urban middle class crowd. But we still have a long way to go. Especially since there are too many people who hold the aforementioned views. There is an influx of ideas and people on the whole are growing more accepting. The caste hierarchy is being replaced by a consumeristic one which is still better than what we have.(suggested by User-13331186939230997432 :P)images from:Dalit Netwerk Nederland (DNN)

can i overdraft my wells fargo account	what is wells fargo  overdraft policy	0	That depends on the type of account you have. If it is an Opportunity Account, then you do not have the option to draft more than your available balance using your debit card, overdraft checks will be returned, etc.If you have any other type of regular account, you can opt into the Debit Card Overdraft Service, which allows you to, at the bank’s discretion, overdraw for one time debit card and ATM transactions. The bank will assess an overdraft fee of $35 per overdraft item up to three (for a maximum overdraft fee of $105 in a single day) if the account is not brought back into the positive by the posted cutoff time that same business day.An important aside here: If your account goes into overdraft, the deposit needs to be made that same day to avoid the fee. Not ‘within twenty four hours’. not ‘first thing the next morning’ but before overnight processing begins that night. And no, that’s not at midnight, check with your local branch to find out the cutoff time. The cutoff time for cash deposits into the ATM is 9PM.	.Wells FargoWhile it’s never a good idea to spend more than you have in your account, it can happen. What does Wells Fargo do when you overdraw your account? It depends on the type of transaction and whether you’ve enrolled in optional overdraft services.Here’s a look at Wells Fargo’s policies and two optional overdraft services:How Wells Fargo treats overdraftsLike many banks, Wells Fargo pays overdrafts at its discretion for the following transactions and charges a fee:Checks.Electronic payments using your account number.Automatic bill payments.If your account is not in good standing, or if you’ve had frequent overdrafts, Wells Fargo may reject them instead of paying them and charge you a fee.Wells Fargo won’t normally cover the following transactions if you don’t have enough money in your account:ATM transactions.Everyday debit card transactions.Instead, it declines them without charging a fee, unless you opt into Debit Card Overdraft Service (see below). If you choose this service, fees apply.Here are details:There is a $35 overdraft fee.You can be charged up to four fees per day for a maximum of $140.Unlike some banks, Wells Fargo won’t charge a continuous overdraft fee if your account remains in the red for an extended period.Fees are deducted from your account the morning after transactions are processed.Optional: Wells Fargo Debit Card Overdraft ServiceIf you select this service, Wells Fargo will cover overdrafts that it doesn’t ordinarily cover — those for ATM use or debit card purchases — and charge fees for it. Due to the Overdraft Protection Act, banks must get permission from customers before covering overdrafts on ATM and debit card transactions.Many people are better off without this service; ATM and debit card transactions will be rejected if there aren’t enough funds in the account, and there will be no fee. But with the service, you run the risk of being hit with multiple $35 overdraft fees.Optional: Wells Fargo Overdraft ProtectionOverdraft protection is a service that links one or two accounts — a savings account, credit card or line of credit — to your checking account to cover any shortfalls.If you don’t have enough money in your checking account, Wells Fargo will transfer money or advance funds from one or both linked accounts, and charge you an “overdraft protection transfer fee” of $12.50. If there are two linked accounts, it will use the savings account first, unless you specify to use the credit card or line of credit first.Here’s how the transfers and advances work:From a savings account, Wells Fargo will transfer enough to cover the transaction plus the $12.50 fee, or a minimum of $25.From a credit card, Wells Fargo will advance the exact amount needed to cover the transaction or a minimum of $25, and the $12.50 fee will be charged to your card.Learn moreat Wells FargoFrom a line of credit, Wells Fargo will advance an increment of $100 or $300, and the $12.50 fee will be charged to your checking account.Wells Fargo’s $5 safety bufferWells Fargo has a $5 margin of error. If your balance is overdrawn by $5 or less at the end of the day, it doesn’t charge overdraft fees.For |Details..Jeanne Lee is a staff writer at NerdWallet, a personal finance website.Email: jlee@nerdwallet.com.

how much do olympic gold medalists earn	how much does an olympic gold medalist earn in china	0	There is no cash prize.Some governments will give incentives to medal-winning athletes. Some give grants to athletes to support them as they train (and the level of the grant may depend on expected competition results, so winning a gold will increase the grant). Many will make most of their income from sponsorship, or appearance fees in other competitions, and winning a gold will increase those.	"Well according to USA Today:So as you can see my country, the USA pays $25,000 for gold.According to RealClearLifeIn general, nations that normally have a lot of Olympic success tend to cut back on the payments accordingly (even if the U.K. took it to the extreme), and those that have had less glory are prepared to be very generous. At the end, we’ll explain why it’s particularly good to be a champ from South Korea.United Kingdom: $0Germany: $19,500U.S.: $25,000 (Yes, Phelps did pocket $125,000 off golds in Rio, though a good chunk of that will go right back to Uncle Sam.)China: $31,400South Korea: $55,000 (The special bonus will be explained momentarily.)Russia: $60,000France: $65,000Australia: $126,000India: $150,000Ukraine: $150,000Italy: $189,800Philippines: $215,000Thailand: $287,000 (also reported as $314,000)Indonesia: $384,000Azerbaijan: $510,000Taiwan: $640,000Singapore: $746,000 (As if Singapore’s Joseph Schooling didn’t already have reason to celebrate after topping Phelps in the 100m Butterfly.)Now to South Korea: Able-bodied males are expected to serve a 21-month tour of duty in the military by the time they turn 28—and if you’re an Olympian, it’s hard to argue you aren’t able-bodied. During their service, soldiers earn a stipend of $120 a month. Particularly for athletes in sports with the potential for high earnings like soccer or baseball, this is a brutal hit, as it takes away a good chunk of their athletic prime.On THE B94.5 LIVE | ALL THE HITS they had:WHAT COUNTRIES PAY THE MOST FOR OLYMPIC MEDAL WINNERSSo, you may not think about this when you watch the Olympics, but athletes actually get paid prize money from their home country for winning! Here’s the catch, that money could be VERY different depending on what country you are from.Singapore pays the highest gold medal prize payout to athletes. Joseph Schooling will receive over 1 MILLION US dollars.Let’s see how the countries shakeout:USA:Olympics Money Per MedalGold	$25,000Silver	$15,000Bronze	$10,000Some other big competitors:Country	Olympic Gold Medal MoneyItaly	$180,000Russia	$135,000France	$65,000China	$31,400Germany	$19,500Some BIG payers:AZERBAIJANIn Azerbaijan gold medalists await a huge payday on top of the government-backed incentive of 400,000 Azerbaijani manat, which is almost $250,000. A silver medalist gets 200,000 AZN ($124,000), while bronze fetches 100,000 AZN ($62,000).KAZAKHSTANIn Kazakhstan, gold medal winners reportedly receive 86 million Kazakhstani tenge, or around $250,000. Silver wins 50 million KZT ($150,000), while bronze gets 25 million KZT ($75,000).THE PHILIPPINESFilipino athletes who bring home a gold medal are granted 10 million Philippine pesos, or $215,000. Silver medalists get 5 million PHP ($107,000), and bronze medalists get 2 million PHP each ($43,000).TAIWANTaiwanese Olympic gold medal winners can get as much as 20 million New Taiwan Dollars, or $640,000, while silver medalists earn $223,000 and a bronze medalists earn $160,000.INDONESIAThe Indonesian government announced a cash prize of 5 billion Indonesian rupiah, or almost $384,000, for gold medalists. Silver and bronze winners will get two billion rupiah, or $152,000, and one billion rupiah, or $76,000, respectively.THAILANDThailand reportedly guarantees a 10 million baht cash incentive for gold medalists, which is around $287,000. A silver medalist gets 6 million baht, or $172,000. The private sector often adds cash prizes too, usually amounting to additional millions of Thai baht.I hope this helps. Thanks for the A2A."

what is reactance in a capacitor	what is the reason behind the reactance of a capacitor	1	There is reactance on both capacitor and inductor. It is the equivalent resistance in ac circuit. Their ac resistance depend on the frequency with opposite effect. Meaning as the frequency is increased, the capacitive reactance goes down while the inductive reactance goes up. The current in a capacitor is 90 deg leading the voltage while in inductor it is lagging. The reason of the reactance is the effect of continuous changing value of voltage applied and so the capacitor or inductor react to it. When peak voltage is reached the capacitor will tend to return the current the opposite direction to discharge while the inductor will conduct the same direction as the power source.

is it true that the cost of living in sv and the bay area is so high that new grads making  150000  have a hard time finding affordable housing	does amazoncom reduce the cost of living in highcostofliving areas like silicon valley	0	Yes, that salary will get you in, but it won't go very far in terms of housing.  I don't know where the other posters are from who are saying it's easy, but finding housing in the Bay Area is hard almost regardless of what you make.   There is virtually no supply.  Yes, you will be able to afford something if you can find it, but that don't make it easy.  I'm a developer making an above average 6 figure salary in the Bay Area.  I just moved here in 2015.  For some reason, I think I should only have first world problems, not this crazy issue of having to scrap the bottom of the barrel just to find shelter.  To move here I had to put a deposit down on a place sight unseen, had to spend a $5K penalty on overlapping temporary housing, and give up my dog.  The place I moved into was far from ideal, it was the only place that met my minimum requirements of commute, cost, and school district.  I can't believe other people think this is normal.   Finding housing is only easy here relative to people making half of what you are, but in no way shape or form is it easy in absolute terms.  Apartments are rented out within 30 days of coming on the market and usually there's a waiting list even at the dumpy places.   That's unheard of almost anywhere else.  You are pretty much guaranteed you will have to make some major compromises to move here despite paying double what a lot of your neighbors will be.  You will have almost zero leverage with your landlord on any major issue.  Half the apartment listings on zillow are outdated.  When you go to them, they will tell you that is just a model, they don't have any current openings or some other bullshit, but will put you on a waiting list which is of no use since you have to sign a year lease with another place in the meantime.  They don't give a fuck about wasting your time, they don't have to.  Whatever supply is there, will go one way or another.  Your problems don't matter, they have 10 other people they can rent to if you don't want it. Forget about renting from individuals.  Half the listings will just have a crazy price and a single photo that may list all the things you're looking for, but don't ask for details, you take it or leave it as is.  Don't bother calling for more information or photos, unless you make all the effort, go to the place and immediately put down a deposit, you likely won't get it.  Its cut throat.Any other place in the country, you would likely be making at least $100K and have substantially more places that were both affordable and available.  I can't think of any area that could possibly be harder to find housing.  The one thing you have working for you is that you are a new grad.  You will find lots of others in your peer group that you can room with and not mind the dorm lifestyle so much and can save up a lot of money here.  Don't confuse that with making housing easy though.	Not by much.The main thing that makes Silicon Valley more expensive than the rest of California is the cost of real estate, of course. You can't buy an apartment on Amazon, so there goes a big chunk of the difference. Same with services of any kind, including restaurant meals, and cars, gas, insurance, and utilities. As for household items, there's a Walmart in Mountain View that's cheap enough; retail real estate may be expensive around here, but if you know how to use it efficiently, you can still offer pretty good prices. Most groceries are just too expensive to ship for Amazon to offer a good deal on them.Now the question asks not for Silicon Valley exclusively but for high cost of living places generally. The one place I know of where Amazon might save you serious money is New York City, and specifically Manhattan. Even groceries can get very expensive there, and any way to get far enough away from the urban core to get better prices is expensive and time-consuming enough not to be worth it.
why is saltwater taffy candy imported in australia	why is saltwater taffy candy imported in austria	1	Why is salt water taffy candy imported in the United Kingdom?Is it? Never seen it anywhere. I only know the term from old Scooby Doo episodes.We don't have the word “Taffy” here, so if anyone wants taffy (rather than toffee or fudge), they would need to make it or import it.I asked an American living here what it was and I seem to remember she said it was softer than toffee, but not the same as fudge. If so, it might be different enough to import some, but probably not different enough to displace those two very popular types of traditional sweets*. If there aren't many people who want it, its unlikely to be economic to make it here. Especially if part of its appeal is in being a traditional american sweet.*I like bonfire toffee the best. You could definitely break a tooth on it though!	Why is salt water taffy candy imported in the United Kingdom?Is it? Never seen it anywhere.

what is value of 0	why does zero factorial 0 equal one 1	0	Approach 1:Any number (real or complex) multiplied by zero is zero. Since 0 is a number, 0x0 = 0Approach 2:Take an empty box, that is the contents of the box are zero. You can add any number of empty boxes; but collectively they remain empty. However number of boxes will increase depending on how many you take.So, you can write mathematically 0x0 = 0Method 3:Multiplication is repeated addition.So, 0 x 0 means adding zero number of times zero. Since 0 + 0 = 0, it follows that0 x 0 = 0	Lets begin with what factorial is. If I have a whole number 'n', then n! = n x (n-1) x (n-2) x ... 3 x 2 x 1. Now coming back to 0!, the simplest answer would be to compete a pattern. Lets take n=5, then5! = 5 x 4 x 3 x 2 x 1Now see the pattern:4! = 5!/5 = 243! = 4!/4 = 62! = 3!/3 = 21! = 2!/2 = 1 0! = 1!/1 = 1 Another way to explain is n! is the number of ways one can arrange n objects. Lets say if you got three boxes A, B and C on a table, you got 3!=6 ways  to arrange them. Let me take out C, then you got 2 boxes which can be arranged in 2!=2 ways. And if I take out B also, you are left with A which can be arranged in 1!=1 way. And as I remove A from the table, then what I am left with is ​So there is literally 1 way to arrange 0 objects on the table as there is no object at all. This one is bit philosophical.Lets get a bit advanced here. Consider the following graph between Whole numbers and their factorial value​In theory, we should get values between 2 and 3 too. How about factorial of 2.5 ? What do you think 2.5! would be ? And Mathematicians generalized this fractional factorial to Gamma function given by:​Also if n is whole number then, Γ(𝑛)=(𝑛−1)!Γ(n)=(n−1)! \Gamma \left( n \right) = (n-1)! which also gives 1 for 0!Now what's the point of having a function that will give you a factorial in between whole numbers when you can't arrange 2.5 objects in real ? So its a generalization and it turns out to be very useful in many case such as Probability. You can use them in formulas of Probability. Consider continuous entity like TIME unlike discrete objects we were considering till now, continuous events like TIME requires a more generalized idea of factorial or fractional factorial.

how do i become an attractive girl	how do you become prettyattractive	1	“Cookie’s” life long lessons on the quest to be “prettier”/sharing my knowledge [rop]don’t be easy or slutty. That is the best way to avoiding being ugly. Be choosy. Everybody says they do it but they really don’t. You don’t want to be easy or you will be the last girl that any guy takes seriously or wants to marry, women will not trust you, your rep will proceed you more than that $10 bottle of Victoria’s Secret Love Spell perfume you bathe in. Think about how guys think about strippers & adult film stars. That’s not the kind of “pretty” you want to be, trust me. (Never allow yourself to be photographed nude!) it’s got/encompasses a lot of negative stuff. Hold out until you find Mr/(Miss) Right not Mr Right-Now. Think of your reputation as something valuable you can shape and affect with your behavior. It’s not cool to have three baby daddies. Virginity is pretty & can only be lost once.2. Watch your mouth. That means don’t curse (it’s not ladylike, it’s really uncouth), don’t lie (remembering what you lied about is a lot harder than keeping up with the truth), don’t spread rumors or hang out with people who gossip (if they speak in such a manner about another person you can guarantee they will have no reservations on “willful ignorance” on you). Don’t disrespect your parents. Make eye contact. Wear lipstick. Say funny and interesting things. Be memorable. Never be mean or rude or cruel, always be sympathetic/empathetic.3. You must do as best as you can with “what you got” (your appearance). Exercise and lose weight. Clothes that are flattering (color costs nothing more, don’t wear anything too tight, too short, too risqué/slutty, wear nice shoes). Do your makeup and nails. Choose an attractive hair color and style. Go for natural colors. Bleach blonde or black may not be intended for you. Colors should resemble those found in nature. Long hair is the best. Short or emasculated styles are unbecoming. Guys don’t want to date one-of-the-boys. Be as feminine as you can. Hirsute is normally negative. Choose trendy glasses or get contacts. Glasses are a fashion accessory same as carrying a statement bag or having cute shoes.4. Personal hygiene (shower or bathe at least once a day), wear deodorant & use soap; have clear skin, touch up your makeup several times a day (don’t let it smear), brush your teeth/floss/don’t have gross breath; wear clean clothes, toss out old worn shoes, pay attention to smelling good (lotion & perfume), style up your hair (but remember you don’t want to keep a guy waiting, you don’t want to be late everywhere & take 3 hours to get to “prettier,” so choose something simple/classic/realistic. Being late is never pretty), and do your makeup. Looks alone don’t make you pretty but no boy wants to kiss an ashtray so don’t smoke.5. Manners. Say please and thank you. Be gracious and kind. Be a graceful loser when it is your turn. Everyone has her triumphs and defeats.6. Don’t drink, smoke cigarettes or do drugs. Don’t be cheap. Don’t be over extravagant, overly political or overly religious, don’t be superficial, actually work on your education or career in earnest. Be honest, be as fair as you can, be firm, believe in yourself (you got this!). Remember moderation is key. No guys like nuns or zealots. Feeling pretty is acting the part. Remember you are acting a part. It isn’t the auditions for the “Clueless” movie. Dumb on purpose isn’t cute. Once you start acting don’t be acting superficial and so fake. It will start becoming natural behavior to act “prettier” (I say “prettier” because I believe in you. You are pretty!), & soon it won’t be a farce like you had expected. Be as sweet as you can, it’s endearing & making yourself memorable is important. Take on a nickname. Mine is “Cookie” because I have an interesting story to go with it and then people associate me with being sweet as well as original. Don’t rip off somebody else’s stories. Be an original! Be responsible always never reckless. It’s not pretty to be a badass. Guys don’t want to marry a felon. Don’t drink and drive, or even consider cheating (on a test, your boyfriend, etc), dishonesty is never pretty but a white lie won’t spare a friend the truth (“do these jeans make me look fat?”) don’t ask those kind of questions. Have beliefs. Take a stand on an issue or support a charity. Don’t be wishy washy (“I don’t know/I don’t care” guys get sick of that. They will find ways to avoid you if you let them pick every movie and restaurant). Be kind to animals, small children, people who have disabilities, senior cititzens, and veterans. Your parents know what is best for you so listen to them. Respectfully agree to disagree instead of arguing. People who like to argue because they get defensive aren’t pretty.7. Online behavior. Write as if you are literate. Don’t use shorthand for dirty phrases (“ffs, stfu, lmfao” etc make you seem low class, even if you will never meet someone in real life keep it  classy class act.) don’t cyber bully or spread gossip. People are judging you based on the few photos you have released (don’t ever send Nude pics!), so make sure they aren’t overly filtered, photoshopped, strategically angled pics that nobody would recognize you on the street but do pic naturally causally posed photos in good natural light that show you off the best). But I get a bad impression of a girl who doesn’t know basic grammar or spelling. Yes, pretty girls are literate!8. Fake it til you make it! If you employ all of my advice you will certainly be “prettier,” people will hold you in high esteem so you can check that low self esteem at the door. Low self esteem is ugly so is too much arrogance. Love yourself. You are your own most valuable advocate. Cut loose the toxic people in your life and hang out with other truly “prettier” individuals who thrive on encouraging each other not tearing them down. Being pretty much any just plastic surgery, Botox, or perfect teeth with a 24” waist. “Prettier” is a lifestyle change. You will falter once in awhile, mo one is perfect, but it will begin an entire new mindset when people react to-, and enforce, the positive behavior & changes you have made in your life. People will sit up and take notice. Enjoy your new found attention. Take a girl who has low confidence under your wing once you get this “prettier” thing down and passing the torch can be so satisfying! I’m passing it to you. What will you do with this knowledge??Sorry I went anon I knew this would be long & im trying to follow my own advice. Sometimes you just have to bear high school like the cross it is that everyone has to bear. I was SEVERLY bullied to the point of wanting to end my life back then. I am much better now. Leaving school (graduation of prep school & 3 stints in different colleges) was the best thing to happen to me. My journey to “prettiness” began when I found the Internet & ive never looked back. I live a fulfilling and rewarding life in real life and I find social media friendships incredibly gratifying and satisfying. Okay I will let you digest what I said. You don’t need to be considered pretty by anybody but yourself. Becoming “prettier” is a life long calling and vocation and every woman can do it. Never apologize for who you are. You are pretty. “Would a rose still smell as sweet by any other name?”	“Cookie’s” life long lessons on the quest to be “prettier”/sharing my knowledge [rop]don’t be easy or slutty.

what are some of the best music albums ever	what is regarded as the best music album	1	Animals by Pink Floyd (Animals (Pink Floyd album))Summary: One of the greatest albums of all time – not only a musical accomplishment to the highest degree, Animals is also a scathing criticism of the system that spawned it.tl;drAnimals is Pink Floyd’s greatest album. Such a statement will be forever refuted by those who fervently admire any of Pink Floyd’s other masterpieces; it’s arguable as to which album is the pinnacle of their success. Of course, it always comes down to a matter of opinion, but with this review the intention is to ardently argue Animals’ case; not only as the greatest Pink Floyd album, not only as one of the greatest records to have ever been made, but also as a triumphant and pessimistic reflection of the world’s descent into capitalism. The metaphorical value of ‘Dogs’, ‘Pigs’ and ‘Sheep’ are extensively ingrained in the criticism of the society which we take for granted, and Animals eloquently lays down a sweeping mockery of the system. In regards to the album’s position amongst Pink Floyd’s far-reaching discography,Animals is situated in a transient period; bearing marks of the band’s psychedelic and drug infused past, building on the largely tentative previous two albums, all while paving the way for The Wall’s concreted concept. It is because of this unique position that Animals holds as to why it is distinguishable from the Pink Floyd catalogue. It does not rely on musical oddities, vast soundscapes or experimentation; it is a composition perfect at its very core, from the pure genius of its songwriting, to a concept to beat all concepts in its relevance and societal value. Animals is, without a doubt, one of the greatest albums of all time.The profound left uprising of the 1970s is a large determinant of the ideology evident on Animals; the after effects of the Vietnam War, a stalemate between the opposing sides of the ideological spectrum, left the world in a disarray, seemingly disillusioned by the supposed sanctity of capitalism in contrast to the ‘Evil Empire’. Economic crises gripped Britain (along with other Western nations, but particularly Britain in respect to Pink Floyd), a pressure borne by the working class. It was these conditions and others like them that ultimately led to the deep seeded cynicism apparent on Animals. The album’s construction is purely metaphorical: ‘Dogs’, ‘Pigs’ and ‘Sheep’ represent the different tiers in the capitalist hierarchy, each song creating a representation of its respective character through ingenious lyrics and at times, musical expressions that are reflective of a particular character’s nature. Beginning with 'Dogs', Pink Floyd paints the portrait of a ruthless and self-obsessed bourgeoisie, the hounds of the upper class. In layman's terms, businessmen, utilizing the free market system to their own and their superiors' advantage; ultimately to the disadvantage of the lower classes, who are forced to bear the brunt of actions from the likes of H.E. Pennypacker, wealthy industrialist and philanthropist, an alias brought to life by Seinfeld's Cosmo Kramer. Such a personality is immortalized in the lines: You got to be able to pick out the easy meat with your eyes closedAnd then moving in silently, down wind and out of sightYou gotta strike when the moment is right without thinkingThe vehement scorn of Pennypacker and co. is brought to light after an atmospheric interlude, one which harkens back to the musical techniques more commonly associated with Pink Floyd’s past; the barking of dogs layered over a synthetic backdrop does well to set the mood and build up towards one of the greatest imaginable finales to a song. Cleverly using the metaphor of a dog, the song alludes to the action of tying a stone around a dog’s neck, subtly referring to the inevitable downfall that awaits the bourgeoisie.And when you lose control, you'll reap the har...	"So I'm gonna go ahead and add some of my favorite albums that I didn't see on here. I'll order it broadly by genre, but not by how much I like each album.Hip Hop:The Love Below - Outkast. While this is only Andre 3000's half of Outkast's double album, it functions as an album on its own. It's a concept album which vaguely tells the story of a couple. Besides the lyrics, which are pretty awesome, the whole album is a genre bending monster, featuring just as many elements of jazz, funk, and rock as it does hip hop (even including a remix of John Coltrane's version of ""My Squanch Things"").The Lucy Ford EP's/God Loves Ugly - Atmosphere. Two of their early albums. Slug takes his deeply introspective, hold-nothing-back approach to writing while Ant produces some great beats sampling everyone from Bartok to Cannonball Adderley. Ant has this kind of droney way of making beats where the song mostly consists of repetition of the same short phrase, which takes a very talented producer to pull off.Camp - Donald Glover. Another highly introspective hip hop album. Not sure how much I can say about this, it would be hard to describe it without reducing it.Classic Rock:Pet Sounds - The Beach Boys. Though I've seen Srgt. Peppers a couple times scrolling through the list of answers, I was surprised that I didn't see the album that inspired Srgt. Peppers. I always thought Pet Sounds was a lot better than Srgt. Peppers (just my opinion, please don't kill me), and although I can see why others might find it to be cliched, but I don't really mind that it's a big collection of love songs (especially when some of the love songs are as amazing and genuine as ""God Only Knows""). Also, it really shines through that the person who wrote this album was the bassist, since it has some killer bass lines, which is especially notable given that prior to this album rock bassists rarely did anything besides play the bass note of whatever chord the guitar/keyboard was playing.Aja - Steely Dan. I can't say I'm overwhelmingly surprised to see that there's no love for Steely Dan on this list given that there's generally little love for Steely Dan in the world in general (not that people hate them, but they're just mostly forgotten). Well this album is a work of genius in my opinion. It is meticulously put together from a combination of great songwriting and great musicianship (my father says all the time that the title track of this album contains the best drum solo ever). Steely Dan comprises of only a keyboardist and a guitarist, neither of whom, despite being great songwriters, are truly amazing at their instruments, and so they hire other musicians to play on their albums. Their fame and songwriting abilities gives them the pick of the litter and they end up coming out with amazing solos on all of their songs.Chicago II - Chicago. ""Is it in fact unfair to criticize a formerly great artist for [their] latter day sins"" - High Fidelity. Well I'm not sure, but this album sure is great. Terry Kath's guitar playing really makes it (whether its his soloing on ""25 or 6 to 4"", or his low key vamping on ""Movin' In"") which makes sense why this band really went down the tubes when he died.Modern Rock (1980 Onwards)Room On Fire - The Strokes. Though its generally overlooked in favor of their much more popular debut album, I will always love The Strokes' sophomoric effort more. I'm not entirely sure if that's because its music is more to my style, or if it just holds a special place in my heart because it was the first Strokes album I ever listened to, but I love it in a way that I love very few albums.Good News for People Who Love Bad News - Modest Mouse. Yet another album that I love ALOT. I came across it in a time of my life where its themes (mostly the inevitability of death) spoke to me in a really core way, and I think it probably changed who I am permanently. Opens up an interesting question though: this album was arguably Modest Mouse's sell-out album (switching from more of a rough indie sound to alternative, signing to a major label, etc.). Assuming that it is (just for the sake of argument), does this reduce its artistic meaning?Fusion JazzApocalypse - The Mahavishnu Orchestra. The Mahavishnu Orchestra and the London Symphony Orchestra team up to play on an album which is somewhere in the gray squanch between rock, jazz, and classical music. That's all that needs to be said.Renaissance - Marcus Miller.NOTE: Aja could also go here, but Steely Dan tends to lean more towards the rock side of the fusion spectrum so I put them in Classic Rock.JazzLady Sings the Blues - Billie Holiday. I don't have a ton to say about this one. Just an awesome album.On Time - Dave Brubeck. All around great modal jazz album, but ""Take Five"" is my indisputable favorite track on this one. If you don't think you've ever heard ""Take Five"", then you're probably wrong. It's one of those songs.Kind of Blue - Miles Davis. Now, Iknowthis one has been listed already, but how could I leave it off? Squanch certainly revolutionized jazz, but also arguably set the stage for jam rock in the '60's. Besides any of that though, it's a great album and I don't think I could ever get bored of it.Progressive MetalPassion and Warfare - Steve Vai. This album set the bar for virtuoso guitar playing from its release to the present (or at least until 2009, but I'll talk about that in a minute).Images and Words - Dream Theater. The Progressive Metal album that started the classic Prog Metal sound, which has, at this point, become common enough that if anyone besides Dream Theater tries to play it straight they just sound like their copying Dream Theater.Animals as Leaders - Animals as Leaders. The newest album (2009) that rocked the Progressive Metal/Virtuoso guitar world. With added elements of jazz, and increased complexity of chordal harmony, Animals as Leaders (and especially their guitarist Tosin Abasi) really raised the bar with this one. I expect this sound will be just as cliched in 25 years as Images and Words' sound is now.Albums from 2015Not every album has to be a classic to be great. Here are some of my favorite albums that have squanch out since the beginning of the year:RockLive at the Beacon Theatre - Umphreey's McGee. Great jam album.Jazz/FusionAfrodeezia - Marcus Miller.The Epic - Kamasi Washington. Who would've expected a 3 hour long hardcore fusion album would be released in 2015?The Squanch of Spring - The Bad Plus. Okay, I cheated a little, this one is from 2014, but how could I not include a jazz Fusion reimagining of Stravinsky's Rite of Spring.Progressive MetalShockwave Supernova - Joe Satriani. I gotta say, he's still got it.Earthkeeper - There Dogs were Astronauts.Inmazes - Vola.Love, Fear, and the Time Machine - Riverside. This might fit better under the banner of Progressive Rock.There's no such thing as the best album because there isn't finite beauty in the world. I can listen to all these albums, and many, many more and come away with the impression ""that was the most beautiful thing I've ever heard"", only to find myself saying the same thing about a different album 40 minutes later. What this means is that if you're on a quest to find the best album, then you're doomed to failure, but if you're on a quest to listen to great music, then you are at the doorway of a fruitful and wonderful adventure that will last your whole life. Whether its The Beatles, or some local band at a small venue, you can find beautiful music everywhere.If you haven't heard all the albums above, then I suggest you take a day to pick through a couple of them. You'll probably hate some of them, and feel meh about most of them, but you just might love some of them.Good luck, and happy listening.EDIT:I am ashamed to announce that it has taken me this long to get around to listening to it, but I have to say that Kendrick Lamar's To Pimp a Butterfly definitely deserves a spot on my list.  Aside from the overwhelming importance of the themes that it tackles, it is a work of pure genius.  It wears its heart on its sleeve so blatantly and effectively that it prompted my sister to say ""If David Foster Wallace was alive today he would have no career.  His movement has gone mainstream."""

what are symptoms of autism in kids	what are the symptoms of autism in girls	0	The spectrum is huge. Many autistic kids do not have the same symptoms as others. These are symptoms that I have noticed in younger children:Speech delay.Poor eye contact.Walks on tippy toes.Very intelligent. Usually siblings are gifted.Mimics what he or she hears.Frequently wanders.Stubborn!Can easily memorize lines of dialogue from a movie.Early reader. Poor comprehension but can read the words.Likes order or a routine.Cannot attend to a conversation. Will just walk away.Difficulty staying on task when the desired work is not highly-interesting to the child. The autistic child will walk away from school work when assignment is incomplete. The autistic child might often rush through work to get it done as fast as possible.Often stares at nothing in particular.Weak upper body. Poor hand strength.Becomes obsessed with something they enjoy like Thomas the Train.Fixates on a particular object and frequently carries it around. I knew of one child who carried a clothes hanger. Another child carried a toy sea creature.Has one or more parents that is very logical/ mathematical or scientific.Intelligent parents.Sometimes they have an older father.The best way to help an autistic child is to start therapy/ intervention as a toddler. Talk to your doctor and get help. Go to your school district. Many districts start therapies at a very young age. My school district has therapist that will come to your home, free preschool and other no-cost services.Do not wait. The earlier an autistic child gets help, the better the results.	Girls with autism have long been misdiagnosed as their symptoms look quite different from those of their male peers on the spectrum.When a child is sent for diagnostic testing to determine an autism spectrum disorder (ASD), the tests, traditionally, are the same for both males and females. Depending on the age of the child being screened for ASD, markers will vary, but generally speaking, doctors test a child’s developmental and social skills as well as sensory processing abilities.Girls will often still exhibit classic symptoms of autism including sensory processing difficulties, hypo or hypersensitivity to pain, delayed verbal skills, self-injurious behaviors, a low threshold for frustrating situations or extreme passiveness, and even co-occurring seizure disorders.Boys and girls develop differently particularly throughout puberty. Girls are traditionally thought to mature faster, develop social skills and emotional intelligence sooner, and have a greater awareness of the world around them. These differences are often noticeable between neurotypical boys and girls as well as boys with autism and their neurotypical peers of both genders. However, autism in girls frequently present to be less socially adept than their neurotypical female peers but do not seem to struggle as much as boys of the same age with autism.Women and girls with Asperger’s syndrome often find themselves misdiagnosed or at a higher risk for co-occurring conditions which may be derived as coping skills or entirely separate issues.Women and girls with Asperger’s syndrome are likely to have higher instances of depression, bipolar disorder, anxiety, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).You can find more information and detailed instructions here: Signs of Autism in Girls - Is Asperger’s in Girls Overlooked?

what is life without dreams	is life a dream or reality	0	Death.Every single person on this planet dreams. Save for about 1% of the population that has suffered damage to the posterior parietal region due to brain damage of some kind. And on occasion they have been able to recover from it. However, the problem has been known to cause the person to go into a coma or become unconscious during sleep.Dreaming is your connection to the higher self, super-consciousness, your soul, your multidimensionality, and anything else that you would like to call that knowing subtle energy body that you have.When you sleep, you “RE PAIR” with all the facets of you and dreaming is a profound and necessary component of that. You are rejoining what has been fragmented, rejoining with a life source that you must have to survive. Without it, there is no life in the physical body, here.	Actually, there is a theory that might answer your question. It's called Solipsism  and it asserts that,..nothing exists but the  individual’s consciousness. At first it seems silly – I mean how can deny the existence of the world around us, and too when s/he is a part of it, living in it? But when you put your mind to it, it really is impossible to verify anything but your own consciousness. Think again!!Hard to believe, huh? But is it?Think for a moment and think of all the possible dreams that you have experienced in your life, the dreams that even though were part of your sleep, felt nothing but true to you when you were in them. Now think calmly. Is it not possible/absolutely impossible that everything around you is nothing but an incredibly intricate dream? A dream that you still are seeing and haven't got out of? Think.But we have people and things around us that we cannot doubt, because we can hear, see, smell, taste and feel them, right? Yes, and no. People who take LSD, for example, say that they can touch the most convincing hallucinations, but we do not claim that their visions are 'reality'.  Your dreams simulate sensations as well, after all, what you perceive is what different sections of your brain tell you to.Solipsism has to face it's share of criticism too. But well, an idea is an idea after all.Suggested reading:SolipsismSolipsism and the Problem of Other MindsWhy Solipsism is BullshitThere is also another very interesting theory I read some time ago. In the movie The Matrix, Morpheus says,“If real is what you can feel, smell, taste and see, then ‘real’ is simply electrical signals interpreted by your brain.”Now let us give it a thought. Though science-fiction, the film The Matrix ponders on a very important scientific problem: that there is currently  no way for us to know for certain if what we experience is real or a  merely a grand sensory fantasy fed to our brains directly. All of the input information  that we receive arrives to us from our eyes, ears and other senses.Prominent scientists and philosophers have calculated that there is at least a twenty-percent likelihood that we are all, in fact, living in a simulation.Read this: Are You Living in a Computer Simulation?Also, scientists are currently fitting  deaf children with Cochlear brain implants that allow them to hear  despite having no physical ear-drums at all. Similarly, there are a  number of devices under development that can be implanted directly into  the visual cortex of the brain, allowing blind people to “see” a digital  video image of the world around them.It actually makes you think that maybe reality is all in our own minds. We do not actually experience the  real world, only the images, sounds and sensations fed to us by our  senses. It’s true that this fantasy is directly influenced by the  physical universe but research has shown that we all perceive the  outside world in very different ways.Since all experience occurs within your mind, the memories that you  hold leading right up to this very moment are as valid as any dream.Is “reality” a dream? I believe that it’s more like a memory of what  our senses perceived a millisecond ago. A story told to us by our minds  to represent our experience of the physical universe.From an objective viewpoint your “mind” would not exist at all. An  objective observer would only see the movement of atoms and electrons  within your brain. Subjective experience is eternally, absolutely  subjective.“Reality is merely an illusion, albeit a very persistent one.”                                                        - Albert Einstein

Before my wife and I were married, we both earned well under that bottom number, and we both lived separately and comfortably in VA. She was in the Courthouse neighborhood of Arlington, and I lived in Alexandria.If you were to budget 25% of your salary (using the $80k mark) for housing, you’d be looking at $1600/month (or thereabouts) for rent. You should have little difficulty finding an apartment within walking distance of cool restaurants, bars, shops, and the subway for that price. You might even be able to rent a house for that. Then take on some roommates to defray that cost even further.Add in other utilities, and you can still be comfortably around 33% of your take home pay, leaving you some discretionary income left over for going out, and enjoying all the DC area has to offer.A little further out there is an area of Fairfax called the Mosaic District. Also close to the subway (Metro), it’s a recently developed “town center” concept. Lots of great little shops and restaurants, including a big new Target, and a movie theater.TL;DR; Yes, you can live quite well on $80–114K/year salary in the DC area.

how do you find out if a girl has a boyfriend	how do i tell if a girl has a boyfriend	1	When you desire information that someone else has, it's often a good idea to simply ask the person for the information.This is ineffective if the person wishes to keep the information secret, but most people are comfortable talking openly about their relationship status.In which case, the only reason you wouldn't ask is your own desire for secrecy.

what are health benefits of red lentils	what are the benefits of eating avocado	0	As the weather gets cooler, curling up on the couch with a hot bowl of soup sounds so inviting.And it’s best to stay away from cream based soups, which may have a lot of added fat. Lentil soup, however, is delicious, nutritious and filling enough that it can be the star of your meal.Lentils are popular in Mediterranean and Indian cooking and come in a variety of types and colors, including red, green and brown. They are reportedly one of the oldest known sources of food, dating back to more than 9,000 years ago.They absorb flavor very well, so in addition to soups, lentils are great for stews and curries. You can even make a cold lentil salad for a gluten-free “pasta salad.” Just be mindful of prepackaged lentils, which may have gluten. I recommend that you visit the bulk section of the grocery store and buy natural lentils.Along with peas and beans, lentils are legumes.“Although research supports the benefits of legume consumption, only ∼8% of U.S. adults report eating legumes on any given day,” according to the National Institutes for Health (NIH).Just a serving of lentils a day may help prevent heart disease.According to a study, eating a serving of legumes (like lentils) may significantly reduce bad cholesterol in the body and, as a result, reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease. This is likely due to the high fiber content in lentils (about 15 grams in one cup).Lentils are cholesterol free and still pack a significant amount of protein (about 18 grams in one cup). Contrary to popular belief, cholesterol is not bad for you. Your body actually needs it to build cells. The problem occurs when you have too much cholesterol. Your body (particularly your liver) makes all the cholesterol you need. Many of us get excess cholesterol from animal foods, like meat and dairy.Lentils also contain antioxidants that may help prevent atherosclerosis, when plaque builds up in the arteries.Lentils have fiber.In general men need about 38 grams of fiber a day, and women need about 25 grams.Fiber may do a lot for your body, including:Aid digestion and relieve constipation. It may even help relieve symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS).Reduce risk of diabetes and help better manage diabetes. Fiber in the intestines may lower the absorption of sugar, which may help blood sugar levels from spiking.Reduce risk of cancer, particularly colon.Aid with weight management. Fiber makes you feel fuller longer, which may help with weight loss and maintaining a healthy weight.And one cup of cooked (boiled) lentils also contains essential vitamins and minerals including:Calcium, 38 mg. An adult between 19-50 years of age (male or female) in general should aim to have about 1,000 mg of calcium per day. This mineral is needed to build and maintain strong bones and teeth. Calcium is also needed for clotting of the blood to stop bleeding and for proper functioning of the nerves, muscles and heart. The National Cancer Institute conducted a study that monitored calcium intake in 135,000 men and women. The subjects who had a calcium intake of more than 700 mg per day had a 35-45% reduced risk of cancer of the distal (lower) part of the colon than those who had a calcium intake of 500 mg or less per day.Magnesium, 71 mg. This mineral helps regulate blood pressure, contributes to bone metabolism and has antioxidant functions. Magnesium is also great for pain management. Many people use magnesium as a safe alternative to ibuprofen or acetaminophen. Magnesium may even help alleviate leg cramps women may experience during pregnancy.Phosphorus, 356 mg. This mineral works with calcium to build strong bones and teeth. It is also needed to help balance and use other vitamins and minerals, including vitamin D, iodine, magnesium and zinc.Potassium, 731 mg. There’s a surprising connection with the liver and potassium. Liver injury or infection causes patients to urinate their potassium out. When the liver heals, the potassium levels start to go back up. This has implications for people with chronic liver problems, in terms of both diet as well as use of medications, since very low potassium levels can be more dangerous than the liver problem alone. Potassium may also help keep blood pressure under control and may even help reduce kidney stones and bone loss as you age.Folate, 358 mcg. Folate (also called vitamin B9) is a very important nutrient, especially for pregnant women. Folate may also help prevent cancer and heart disease and improve mental health. A study from Harvard Health demonstrated folate may also be useful in treating symptoms of depression.Remember, healthy eating is one of the best ways we can be proactive about our overall health. Make every meal an opportunity to do something good for your body.Source: Why Lentil Soup May Be Better than Chicken SoupI hope my answer was helpful!

Avocados are truly an amazing food for many reasons, but until recently, you wouldn’t know it. Years of being scared away from fat-containing foods have led many people to overlook avocados. Today — thanks in part to the low-fat diet risks that have been revealed — we know that avocado benefits include critical, healthy fats in addition to much more: various antioxidants, multiple trace minerals and vitamins too.You may be wondering, is an avocado a fruit or a vegetable? In fact, avocados are actually a fruit. They are great in both savory and sweet dishes.Avocados are a nutrient-dense fruit that contain about 20 vitamins and minerals. Given its nutritious make-up, there are many avocado benefits. These include better heart and digestive health; healthy skin, hair and eyes; cancer prevention and weight loss, among others.1. Improved Heart HealthAvocados (and especially avocado oil) promote heart health by balancing blood lipids because of their fatty acid composition. In terms of their chemical make-up, avocados are about 71 percent monounsaturated fatty acids, 13 percent polyunsaturated fatty acids and 16 percent saturated fatty acids.2. Lower Risk for Metabolic SyndromeEating avocados has been found to be clinically associated with lower metabolic syndrome in U.S. adults. Metabolic syndrome is a term for a cluster of conditions that increases your risk of developing heart disease, stroke and diabetes. Some other avocado benefits include help with: hypertension, high blood sugar, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, obesity and excess body fat around the waist.Essentially, eating avocados helps regulate hormones associated with risk factors for diabetes, obesity and cardiovascular diseases, including insulin, triglycerides and cholesterol.3. Healthy Skin, Eyes and HairAvocados are a high-antioxidant food that contain lutein, a type of carotenoid that protects eye health and preserves healthy, youthful looking skin and hair. Carotenoids are the group of antioxidant phytochemicals found in veggies like carrots, squash and sweet potatoes that are known for blocking the effects of environmental toxins like pollution and UV light damage.To promote a healthy, shining complexion, simply rub the inside of an avocado peel on your skin and use avocado oil as your primary moisturizer. Mix in some therapeutic essential oils and you can easily make a cost-effective lotion instead of pouring out money for that store-bought stuff filled with irritating chemicals! Avocado can also be used to make homemade hair masks to replenish, moisture and add shine.4. Cancer PreventionSeveral studies have surfaced recently touting avocado as a cancer-fighting food. The Journal of Nutrition and Cancer published the results of a study, for instance, claiming that the phytochemicals in avocados are so powerful that they could prevent the use of chemotherapy in people with oral cancer!

what are some math related working models for class 10th	how can i make a working model on maths	0	When I was in my 10 standard I made a model to show properties of similar triangles:-Property1-Corresponding angles are congruent (same measure)Property2-Corresponding sides are all in the same proportionSo, I made a single standing triangle on a wooden board with just 3 pieces of logs with the help of a carpenter nearby.2 sides were stick such that they form 2 adjacent sides of a triangle and the 3rd side was free to make different triangles from the same base model and show those above 2 properties.Then I put some nails on the logs such that each nail on one log have the corresponding nail on another log such that if I put the 3rd free log on the nails it forms the 3rd side. and I can lift it and put it on another pair of nails.Thus 1st property can be evidently seen. Also at the same time when I put the log on different pairs of nails, the different triangles thus formed will have the same proportions of sides as well.Here I attach some 3d images.This is particularly simple but if you play more with this you can make it more amazing like using threads to roll them over nails from different pairs and see if they form some amazing triangles.This is what it will look like-(Here the 3rd side is lying free)These black dots are nails.So in previous 3 images I used different pairs of nails to form the 3rd side of a triangleAll three triangles so formed are similar.They will certainly have all their corresponding angles equal and also they will have the same proportion of respective sides.Note:It is not a solid project. It just shows intuition that how math can be visualized.For more such content Please subscribe http://www.youtube.com/fivecube and Gugal OxideOther Projects that you can make include1)Showing how ellipse can be formed using 2 nails and thread and a pencil using your hand(or motor if you wish to make it really mechanical)…(but u haven’t studied it in 10?

how could i gain weight in a healthy way	how can i gain healthy weight and mass	1	"How to Gain Weight SafelyA large part of the population has to deal with being overweight or obese. But there are also many people with the opposite problem, as they are too thin or underweight. This is a concern because being underweight can be just as bad for your health as being overweight. It is also true that many people who are not officially underweight still would like to add a few pounds. Whether you have officially underweight or are a ""hard gainer"" who has difficulty in gaining weight, the main principles are the same. In this answer, I will show you how you can quickly gain weight in a healthy way.What is underweight?Underweight is defined as a body mass index (BMI) of below 18.5. This is seen as less than the body weight in order to maintain good health. On the other hand, above 25 is considered overweight and over 30 as obese. Use the BMI calculator to check your current BMI. However, remember that there are many problems with the BMI calculation, as it only takes into account your weight and height. It does not account for muscle mass. Some people are naturally very thin but healthy. Underweight according to the BMI calculation does not necessarily mean that you have a health problem. Underweight is more common among girls and women than among men.How can you gain weight healthily?If you want to gain weight healthily, it is very important that you do it right. Pigging out with sodas and donuts might help to gain weight, but it can also ruin your health. If you are underweight, then you want to achieve a balanced amount of muscle mass and subcutaneous fat, and not a lot of unhealthy belly fat. There are many people of normal weight who has type 2 diabetes, heart disease and other health problems associated with obesity. Therefore it is of utmost importance that you live a healthy diet and eat in a healthy way. Conclusion: It is very important to eat mostly healthy even if you are trying to gain weight. Now let's look at several effective ways to quickly gain weight without ruining your health.Eat more calories than your body burnsThe main thing you can do to get it is to eat more calories than your body needs. A calorie surplus is needed. Without it you do not gain weight. You can approach your calorie needs (maintenance level) by multiplying your body weight by 30. If you want to gain weight slowly and steadily, aim for 300-500 calories above your maintenance level food. If you want to quickly gain weight, you point it at approximately 700-1000 calories above your maintenance level. Remember that rules for calculating calorie needs only provide a cure. Your specific needs may differ by a few hundred calories, upwards or downwards. You do not count calories for the rest of your life, but it helps to count the calories in the first few days/weeks to get a sense of how many calories you should eat. Conclusion: You should eat more calories than your body burns in order to gain weight. Focus on 300-500 calories above your maintenance level, or 700-1000 calories if you need to arrive quickly.Eat plenty of proteinThe most important nutrient for anyone who wants to gain weight healthily is protein. Studies show that during periods of overfeeding, a high-protein diet converts a lot of extra calories into muscle. But remember that protein is very filling, so it can reduce your hunger and appetite. This can make it difficult to get enough calories.  Try to consume at least 1.5 - 2.2 grams of protein per kilogram of body weight. Foods with many proteins are red meat, chicken, fish, eggs, dairy products such as cottage cheese, and nuts. Protein supplements like whey protein may also be useful if you're struggling to get enough protein. Conclusion: Proteins are the building blocks of your muscles. Eating enough protein is required to arrive in muscle rather than just fat.Eat plenty of carbs and fat, and eat at least three ti..."

what kind of animal did this	what kind of animal are you	0	This is the surface of a car? Up on the hood (bonnet), or the roof? If so, I highly doubt it was a snake, since the metal surface of a car would become way too hot on a sunny day for a snake. Snakes will bask in the sun when the temperature is cool; this is how they warm up. But on a warm, sunny afternoon they will seek cool places like damp leaves in the shade or a little space under a rock.A snake has smooth scales on its belly, not “toothed” structures that could make a pattern like that. Additionally, I can't think of any way a slithering snake could leave a lighter colored trail by slithering across a surface.It could be helpful to know the size of the marks. How wide is that little path? I wonder if your mystery pattern could be from the tail feathers of a bird, hopping around on the car. But that's just speculation.	When I was a little girl, I loved horses so much that I broke the leg off the donkey from our expensive Christmas Nativity set playing with it (it still leans against the wall of the barn every Christmas), and I stole a gorgeous plastic horse from a toy store, but my mother made me return it and I confessed it at every single confession (I was Catholic) until the priests must have wanted to strangle me. I wanted to go blind so I could own a seeing eye dog like the boy in the book FOLLOW MY LEADER by James Garfield.My family finally got a poodle without me having to go blind. After my parents died, I settled for a stray or abandoned cat because I was working full-time. I have now been owned by three cats, two still living. As my sister said when I was sobbing over the death of my first cat, “The only bad thing about pets is that they die too soon.”On the other hand, I don’t march in protest over the treatment of animals, I regretted the end of Ringling Brothers’ Barnum & Bailey Circus (despite the live animals being mistreated), and I eat meat.
how does anil ambani benefit from rafel fighter jet deal	what is bought more online	0	There is a 50% offset clause in the Rafale deal.That implies 50% of the components used to manufacture the warbird will be sourced from India (now you know from whom in India). Also recall the recent shift in Indian defence policy towards indigenous procurement. So Reliance stands to gain from it.Moreover they will also gain the capability to manufacture equipment which is defence related. Unlike TATA & Mahindra who manufacture vehicles (it gives them a leverage with MOD ) Reliance is more of a lateral entry. So Dassault is like a kick start mechanism.A close look at LNT gives us a cue as to how the capacity to manufacture defence related equipment adds to your credibility (Which Reliance lacks)This is what I think….	Earrings and necklaces too! Women love these items probably because they draw attention to wearer's face. Bracelets are also great to make emphasis on the beauty of the hands.Grace,Page on iloveitineedit.com

This is also variable upon your level of activity including the physical therapy that you I assume are partaking in. Also your overall state of health including the ability to heal fast. If you a diabetic then healing is a longer process which can translate to longer lasting pain symptoms. As I have always said to my patients that the pain you may be experiencing is post operative pain and will generally gradually decrease over the first 3 months post operatively. However there are many factors that can escalate you pain symptoms from day to tay. Firstly increased activity such as ambulating around your environment, secondly physical therapy. Remember when you have a total knee you are incising through fat and muscle and then cutting bone to accommodate the upper and lower components of total knee. In addition your severing sensory nerve ending which regenerate very slowly over time and those areas initially that felt numb begin to awaken generating pain. Another issue that could cause knee pain at this point is the possibility of a occult or small infection within the knee that may be festering within the capsule of the knee joint, that is not enough to cause systemic symptoms but perhaps locally. In any case for all the possibilities, and I just listed a few the only way to truly to get the most precise and accurate answer is to discuss your concerns with the orthopedic surgeon who did your total knee. He is the one who can examine you and image your knee to determine if in fact there is some going on as described or as simple that your a slow healer. Getting an accurate answer in this forum is is anybody's guess since know one here can examine your knee, and have the ability to do what your orthopedic surgeon has at their disposal to accurately answer your question.
how do i know if my spouse is my soulmate	how can i know that he is my soulmate	1	Meeting one’s soul mate is like meeting no other. Perhaps you will first notice the person because, at first sight, they will stand out in a crowd like a 100 watt light bulb would on a Christmas tree. Your first inner thought might ask, is this the one? When you meet the energy between you will be electric and the two of you will naturally get along. You’ll find that you hold almost all (if not all) of the same interests, desires and goals. Conversation between the two of you will flow effortlessly and neither of you will want it to end. Being with your soul mate will make you happy and content. You’ll find that it is easy to relax and be yourself in their presence. Intimate relations between the two of you will begin at the same high level as they do in all new relationships, but with your soul mate this sexual energy will not evaporate (as it has in past relationships), rather, in time it will reach an ever higher level (one you’re unlikely to have experienced before) and remain there forever. Your soul mate will probably know many of your thoughts before you express them as you will know his (this may at first seem a little spooky – in over 40 years this never ceased to amaze me as Jeane consistently knew what I was thinking in the same way I knew her thoughts).As you get to know your soul mate a deep connection will form between the two of you; you will be best friends, constant companions and electric lovers. Once you begin living together you will both discover that you will never tire of each other’s company. When you go out as a couple others will notice that there is “something special” about the two of you, even if they have a difficulty in saying exactly what this difference is. Year after of year of togetherness will not dim any aspect of your connection and one day you’ll realize that you’ve achieved the kind of perfect relationship together that is described in books, movies and fairy tales.In short; being with one’s soul mate is like going from driving a Mazda Miata to driving a Lamborghini: There is no comparison!	We meet lot of people in our lives, who play different roles. But there is only one person who is unlike any other. A soulmate is a mirror. Here are the characteristics of Soulmate relationship.Soulmates don’t always have to be romantic partners. He/She can be your family, friend, relative, neighbor, teacher or a stranger.You always feel a strong, deep, soul connection. When soulmates first meet they sometimes feel as if they already know each other.You feel he/she fully understands you. Your soulmate makes you feel entirely whole, healed and intact, like no piece is missing from the puzzle.They accept your flaws with ease. They should always make you feel secure and protected.You know intuitively what the other is thinking or feeling.They come for a reason and make a huge impact on your life. They will help you grow in love and wisdom and help you become the best possible version of yourself.You connect with them on every level.They support and guide you as you journey through life.Your relationship may not last forever but the love is always there.It can't be explained in words. It's a soul thing.
how do i get to be a people person	how should i be a people person	1	"Steve jobs had a beautiful saying. It goes like this:""Everything around that you call life was made up by people who were no smarter than you.""People pleasing comes from approval addiction.It comes from the misguided belief that people like you because of what you did for them and not because of who you are. It becomes toxic when you start compromising your own values and beliefs in order to please somebody and get their approval. With time, you start losing sense of who you are. Your self disintegrates and then there is nothing of you that remains.There is a three step process that goes in every unhappy people pleaser :1. You sacrifice your own values and beliefs to please somebody and get their approval.2. You feel resentful.3. You start blaming other people.The way to break this cycle is to understand that you can live your life the way you want it without anybody's approval and there is nothing wrong about it. That once you decide to have a life then people who are similar to you will automatically feel attracted towards you, like you and respect you. You don't have to do anything for them that involves sacrifice. You just have to BE and they will like you for that.Once you get over your fear of disapproval and start approving yourself, slowly and slowly, you will feel less and less disturbed whenever somebody disapproves of you.It is a gradual process of self awareness and self love. You realise that the most important person you need to please is yourself. It doesn't mean you are being selfish. It just mean that you care about your own feelings and values more than that of  others. That you are willing to fight for yourself. That you will not sacrifice your values for somebody else. That You can still be a compassionate and caring person while firmly rooted in your own values and beliefs.Getting over approval addiction means getting over your fear of disapproval, conflict and condemnation. It means creating boundaries and not let anybody violate them in any circumstances.It means taking responsibility for your feelings and your life.It means choosing happiness over resentment.It means choosing self respect over self loathing.It means loving yourself even if at the moment, you believe nobody does."	"Making friends and being a ""People Person"" are two completely different things. While making friends is on the easier side as compared to latter as being a people person demands a great deal of abilities and self determination. instead of giving lectures, we can understand this using a situation in all cases.Hero of the Group :Start talking when you're in a group. Everyone respects and want to befriend the person who can easily interact with people in a group. The one who can make others laugh is the one who is most talked about. Being an introvert doesn't help.You may feel ignored at first or out of the topics. But being good at something takes time. Forget what other people will think about you if you say something wrong. Everyone is too busy to think about you.Be the Boss: Never show your weakness to others. Don't give people the chance to judge you on anything. Consider yourself the boss, who can do anything. Don't confuse it with ""bragging"". Remain motivated and Enthusiastic: None really want to talk to the guy who doesn't take interest in them. I won't talk to the one who doesn't wanna listen to me. So develop interest in people. Interest in people can be developed by thinking about their abilities and skills. If you think and talk about their weeknesses, it certainly isn't gonna do anything good.Find out people like you: For makings friends, you just have to look the people who share same interests with you. Let's say you read books, then being friends with a book addict isn't a daunting task. Talk about books you have read and know about books the person has gone through. Respect his thoughts and views. Start by sharing books and giving valuable suggestions.Be Ready to help: Help people more than getting help from them. If you always talk about your problems, the other guy may lose interest in you. Listen to his problems and advise some solutions.Don't take anyone for granted. Everyone wants to be respected, keep this thing in mind while talking with anyone.Learn to initiate conversations. Keep your shyness or ego or attitude aside for a moment and start initiating conversations. You will get a very good feeling after doing so.Don't just remember the people when you need them. Be ready for them when they need you too. Someone has rightly said ""best time for making friends is before you need them""."
how does a long distance relationship work	do long distance relationships work	1	"...and my long distance girlfriend asks me to answer this question. Michelle and I have had a long distance relationship for almost two years now. At the end of this month I'll be moving in with her, closing the three hundred mile gap that's been between us to zero. I can't wait.Here's how we did it, in no particular order:Be in each other's presence as often as possible. For us, that was an average of once a month for a weekend. That's rough, but better than nothing. I had many different coping mechanisms for this, and not all of them were healthy. A lot of self reflection and incredible patience from Michelle got me over the hump.Face time. If you can't be with each other, see each other. The webcam is a wonderful thing, use it. Google hangouts, Skype, whatever. Being able to share a smile, a goofy wink, blowing kisses, or just to stare in each other's eyes can not be understated.Phone time. If you can't be with each other or see each other, talk. As often as possible. Just hearing the other person's voice can do wonderful things to your psyche. Michelle and I would read Quora answers to each other.Patience. Your going to need a lot of this, and it's going to have to go both ways. I lack in patience. This had a tendency to make things more difficult than they needed to be. Don't be me.Understanding. Man, this long distance stuff is tough, isn't it? Always moping around, trying to ""find the time"" to get your stuff done and still spend some quality ""cam time"" together. All the stress, all the pressure.

It sure seemed easier to shut down and not pine and mope and miss Michelle, but it's not. Don't do it.Communicate. Hey look, something else I struggled with. I had a thirteen year relationship with an alcoholic before Michelle, and quite honestly, I think I forgot how to communicate in a healthy relationship. Don't be me.

how do i speak fluent english	how can i understand english	1	"I have already answered a similar question. Let me reproduce the answer here.Most of us (especially, Indians) form a sentence in our native language, translate it in English and then use it in a conversation. You have to stop doing that. Start thinking in English. Its a bit tough, but it will become easier and spontaneous with time. Don't think in your native language, think in English. This is the biggest hurdle in the process of improving your communication skills. Once you cross it, nothing can stop you.Now how to do that? Simple. Speak with your mind whenever you get time. But speak in English. Don't worry about grammar. Just speak.Now, let's focus on improving your fluency.Start reading newspapers, magazines, novels, blogs and whatever you can. But don’t just read, try to understand it. And make an opinion about it. Especially about editorials, opinions and issues.For example, lets say you read an article about drought in India. After reading it, think about it for some time. Then talk to yourself about it. Stand in front of a mirror and explain the issue to your reflection. Sounds funny, right? But trust me, it will help. And also think about what can be done to solve the problem, its outcomes etc and tell it to your reflection. Initially you will feel embarrassed, but keep doing it and you will certainly improve your English.One more activity that might help. I assume you have a laptop or pc (even a smartphone would work). Download some good serials (I will recommend Sherlock, Suits and GOT(caution: this one not for children)) and watch them by keeping subtitles on. Understand how they talk, how they pronounce a particular word. Then mute that serial and try to make similar pronunciations by reading those subtitles. It will not only improve your pronunciation but also boost your confidence.One more activity that might improve your fluency in English. Find a friend/relative/anyone (being an Indian, I know that this can be a bit tough as whenever you start speaking in english, you are accused of ""shininig"") who speaks English fluently and converse with him as much as possible. Ask him/her to point out your mistakes and also how to correct them.P.S. I have developed a course on Unacademy for those who want to improve their English, especially spoken English.Learn Spoken English Using Innovative Methods - UnacademyYou can have a look at it. It’s absolutely free."	I was in China recently and noticed how Chinese people look down at their English, even when they do speak it quite well. I believe that is a cultural thing. As Michael Affleck mentioned your English is excellent and your question was very well expressed.My suggestion is that you work on changing your mindset about your English knowledge. Just because all your countrymen say their English is bad, you don’t need to do the same.Start thinking and saying to yourself that English is an easy language to learn even though it’s very different from Chinese. Stop comparing yourself to the foreigners you mentioned.Think about when you didn’t know any English and started learning it, and realize how much progress you have made since then. You do know a lot of English and can express yourself to a certain extent. Now, you would like to become even better in it and work towards that goal.However, you won’t be able to progress in it without accepting that you do know lots of English compared to years ago. And now, with the Internet and other tools, it’s very easy to expand your knowledge.I suggest that you create an English club at your university and invite whoever wants to talk in English to participate. Think about topics to talk about. Read English books and get together to discuss them. Watch English movies together and do the same. Listen to music and sing along together. Ask English teachers at your school for suggestions. As other students start to come, ask them for suggestions.The more you use your English, the easier it will become and the more confident you will feel speaking and writing it!Take action and have fun!
considering your position as secretary of state gave you insight into america  drone program what will you do to reform the targeting process	what was your biggest challenge as secretary of state	0	Now that the House Intelligence Committee has concluded that there was no Russian collusion between trump and Russia, can we start looking at other foreign intervention in our election process?What we’ve had going on since the 2016 election is distrubing. Let me place this in some context for the bicoastal liberals who voted for Hillary. We had a speech recently of Hillary actually saying that the rest of the voters (non California and non New York) are smarter than all the republicans in the center of the country! But they believed in Trump, not Hillary.(Video in link)[1] Wow! We also have the media trying to say Trump is a horrible President because he’s involved with a porn star? Remember their defense of Bill Clinton who was guilty of peccadilloes for having “private meetings” with an intern.[2] In the White House and it was just personal. Just sex. Nothing to do with running the country. Fast forward to Obama’s use of our government to spy on us, collude with Hillary (DOJ and FBI and NSA) and Russia to fabricate their collusion narrative. Obama did far far worse than Trump ever did by using government to attempt to undo an election! Obama corrupted our entire democracy, while Trump may have corrupted his marriage. If you don’t see that difference then I don’t understand your progressive thinking.We have voter ID cards being given to Chicagoans[3] and,voter fraud (and dead voters) in several states like Texas for example (por exemplo).[4]With the aggressive positions on no border wall and DACA, plus immigration being unchecked (Open Border policy) by progressives to resist ICE, to advise illegals of them being at risk of deportation, the non-citizen voter situation is reaching critical mass.SHOCKING: Susan Rice Ordered NSA to Stand Down in 2016: SUSAN RICE, A LONGTIME ACCOMPLICE OF BARACK OBAMA ORDERED THE NATIONAL SECURITY COUNCIL TO STAND DOWN ON THE ALLEGED RUSSIAN MEDDLING IN THE 2016 ELECTION. SHE THEN THREATENED THEM WITH STRICT CONSEQUENCES IF THEY CONTINUED.This tells us (those who are interested in the truth and details) more of an insight into how Trump was spied on, and where the blame falls. Certainly no one in the Obama administration operated in deference to what President Obama wanted. Now we see who the operatives were and where the plan, or plans, have their genesis.When or will the media get off their high-horse and cut the nonsense they’re spreading about the Russians. The hypocrisy is stunning—I know, we all know, the Russians are out to disrupt our politics. Got it! What I can not fathom is the dishonest reporting by the major producers of news are not playing straight with their audience. The news media, one could argue, are colluding, aiding and abetting the Ruski’s. We have been hearing there are Russians trying to alter our politics. No! The News outlets are doing what the Russians could never do, and they don’t even have to translate their propaganda into English. They are pumping out filthy lies on TVs in every airport on this planet.Australian diplomat whose tip prompted FBI’s Russia probe has tie to Clintons The Australian diplomat whose tip in 2016 prompted the Russia-Trump investigation previously arranged one of the largest foreign donations to Bill and Hillary Clinton’s charitable efforts, documents show.Former Australian Foreign Minister Alexander Downer’s role in securing $25 million in aid from his country to help the Clinton Foundation fight AIDS is chronicled in decade-old government memos archived on the Australian foreign ministry’s website.We know that Downer and former President Clinton jointly signed a MOU (Memorandum of Understanding) in February 2006 that spread out the grant money over four years for a project to provide screening and drug treatment to AIDS patients in Asia.http://thehill.com/opinion/judic... The fact is that the Russians did not have to collude to achieve their purpose of disruption and influence. Russian intelligence is not known to run “colluders” in carrying out secret operations and rarely expose their operations in gratuitous meetings. Collusion theories tying Donald Trump to a Russian conspiracy remain the case of the dog not barking.After more than a year of intensive investigation by both the special counsel and multiple congressional committees, there is no direct evidence of Trump colluding with Russians. After roughly 100 criminal counts against 19 defendants and five plea deals with cooperating witnesses, there is no direct evidence. After dozens of pages of “speaking indictments” by Robert Mueller describing Russian operatives trying to influence the election and false statements from former Trump aides, there is no direct evidence.So, (considering what we now know?) Obama had no scandals during his administration (that embarrassed him). Some readers may be thinking—“that’s right!” Some readers may be thinking—“whiskey tango foxtrot!” Which, if any (to be objective), of these would points refute that statement?https://www.cnn.com/2018/02/27/p... SUSAN RICE, A LONGTIME ACCOMPLICE OF BARACK OBAMA ORDERED THE NATIONAL SECURITY COUNCIL TO STAND DOWN ON THE ALLEGED RUSSIAN MEDDLING IN THE 2016 ELECTION. SHE THEN THREATENED THEM WITH STRICT CONSEQUENCES IF THEY CONTINUED.I would note that the list (not detailed) certainly doesn’t include the residual scandals occurring whilst the changing of the guard was in process (aka a fair, open and free election). We’re current on that so you, the reader, can think about those as you get a tour de force and journey back over his 8 scandal free years...enjoy. Please comment, not on the length, but on any errors. I might want to write a book about our recent great first African American President. If Obama’s terms were scandal free, Nixon (Richard Nixon committed far greater crimes than the watergate break-in) and Clinton (http://www.history.com/topics/us-presidents/bill-clinton) deserve a pass by historians as to their “short comings”.At least Bill Clinton was only screwing around with a few people, yes I said it, while Obama was screwing over an entire country (I said it again—sorry). Nixon used a few “plumbers” to break into a DNC office while Obama’s people, including several politicians, broke in to our election process, collaborated with the Russians, violated several people’s 4th Amendment rights, abusing the FISA court, laundering money, etc. A slight difference in crimes.http://investmentwatchblog.com/t...The Complete List of Barack Obama’s Events PUBLISHED SEPTEMBER 17, 2013 · UPDATED JANUARY 19, 2018• $6 trillion in new national debt under Obama…after he promised to decrease the deficit.• Obamacare — A massive and incredibly convoluted bill which exponentially increases the federal government’s control over our personal lives…which neither Obama nor a single Democrat even read before passing, and which will likely bankrupt the nation.• In both the 2008 and 2012 presidential elections, the Obama campaign purposely disabled the credit card verification system for its Web site donations, allowing anyone from any foreign country to donate with no limit and no proof of identity; in both elections it was demonstrated that people overseas and people with obviously false identities were able to donate to Obama campaign, in direct violation of several laws. To this day it is not known what percentage of Obama’s campaign funds are illegally obtained, since there is no documentation.• Billions of taxpayer dollars gambled on “green” companies like Solyndra, NextEra, Ener1, Solar Trust and many others — all of which went bankrupt.• An intentional refusal to enforce federal immigration laws.• Unemployment at or above 8% for almost his entire term in office (which was actually closer to 15% actual unemployment).• Operation Fast & Furious — a government-sponsored illegal gun-running scheme designed to purposely go awry so as to induce public outcry for gun control.• Spent 20 years listening to a racist anti-American pastor (Rev. Jeremiah Wright), whom Obama described as a mentor. On March 18, 2008, Obama gave a speech in which he said “I could no more disown Jeremiah Wright than I could disown my own grandmother” and “[Wright's church, Trinity United] embodies the black community in its entirety.” Now Obama tries to pretend that Jeremiah Wright doesn’t exist, and that his extremist anti-white philosophy didn’t influence Obama’s worldview.• Increased the percentage of Americans dependent on food stamps to unprecedented levels (now over 15% of the nation’s population).• Militarily intervened in Libya in 2011 without the Congressional approval required by the War Powers Act — technically an impeachable offense.• Before he entered politics, Obama worked as a lawyer suing banks in landmark cases, forcing them to give home loans to unqualified minority borrowers — a practice now understood as one of the primary initial causes of the eventual housing bubble and market collapse.• Handed out over 1,200 waivers to politically connected donors exempting them from the onerous requirements of Obamacare.• Greatly expanding the number of unaccountable “czars,” which essentially amounts to unilaterally adding new federal departments with no congressional oversight — leading to a true “bureaucracy” in the original sense (rule by unelected bureaucrats).• Using taxpayer dollars to bail out the private pension funds of autoworkers’ unions at GM & Chrysler.• Illegally ending the welfare-to-work requirements passed by Congress.• Doling out $800 billion in stimulus cash for “shovel-ready” jobs that didn’t exist — the money just evaporated with no measurable economic benefit.• Alienating and isolating Israel, our strongest ally in the Middle East.• Apologizing to Islamists and terrorists for offending them.• Under Obama’s watch, for the first time in history America’s credit rating was downgraded, due to his poor economic policies.• Stopped American oil drilling in the Gulf of Mexico, allowing other nations with worse environmental records to drill instead — thereby managing to both weaken our economy and damage the environment simultaneously.• Proposed in 2008 to intentionally bankrupt the coal industry — and now lies to voters and workers in coal-producing regions about his true intent.• Pretends to be concerned about skyrocketing energy prices, when in fact he vowed to increase them on purpose (so as to make alternative energy schemes more competitive.)• In a primary debate against Hillary Clinton in 2008, Obama said he would never force people to buy health insurance, since those without it couldn’t afford to buy it. Less than two years later, he rammed through Obamacare, which does indeed force people to buy health insurance.• During the 2008 campaign, Obama repeatedly promised that if he was elected “No family making less than $250,000 will see any form of tax increase.” This promise was broken over and over again once he was elected.• In 2008 Obama vowed if elected to increase security along the U.S.-Mexican border — and then in 2010 stopped construction of a “virtual fence” on the border and re-routed money earmarked for border security to other projects.• Cash for Clunkers, which doled out taxpayer money to anyone who wanted to replace their old cars, but which mostly only ended up subsidizing the puchase of foreign-made cars by people who could have afforded them on their own anyway; meanwhile, the traded-in cars were all destroyed, creating a shortage and thereby increasing the cost of used cars, hurting the pocketbooks of poor people.• Violated the U.S. Constitution by authorizing assassinations and drone strikes to kill American citizens abroad — without due process.• Was caught on a “hot mike” promising the President of Russia that he would cave in to their demands for a weaker missile shield — after he was re-elected and no longer had to keep up the pretense that he sought to defend America.• Appointed Van Jones, a former avowed communist who supported a “9/11 Truth” petition, to be “Green Jobs Czar.”• Appointed Anita Dunn, who said Chairman Mao was her “favorite philosopher,” to be White House Communications Director.• Appointed John Holdren, who perviously entertained the notion of forced mass sterilzation to stop overpopulation, to be Science Czar.• Appointed Steven Chu, who openly advocated an artificial increase in gasoline prices to $10/gallon (and similar increases in other energy prices) to be Secretary of Energy.• Appointed Kevin Jennings, who led a group that promoted X-rated “sex-positive” textbooks for 13-year-olds, instructed teenagers at a conference how to perform “fisting” (anal penetration by fists), who refused to report instances of statutory rape, and who expressed admiration for a member of NAMBLA, to be America’s “Safe School’s Czar.”• When states voted to enforce the federal immigration laws which the federal government refused to enforced, Obama sued to stop them.• Blocked continued construction of the Keystone Pipeline, thereby intentionally reducing energy resources for the US and forcing Canada to sell more of its oil to China.• Repeatedly changed his position on gay marriage over the years, depending on what was politically expedient at the moment and which intended audience he was addressing.• Before he was president, Obama staunchly opposed raising the national debt limit — but once elected, he insisted that it be raised.• When giving a 2009 speech in France that he must have assumed Americans would never hear, he described the United States as “arrogant” and “dismissive” (while also criticizing Europe elsewhere in the speech).• When states tried to stop election fraud with voter ID laws, Obama sued to prevent them from doing so.• Instructed Attorney General Eric Holder to stonewall any investigation into the voter intimidation case against the New Black Panthers.• Promised in 2008 that once elected he would officially recognize the Armenian Genocide; but to this date he has still failed to do so, caving in to threats and pressure from Turkey.• Vowed to end the influence of lobbyists in Washington, but under Obama’s watch their influence has only increased.• When he was first running for President, Obama promised, “I will not sign any non-emergency bill without giving the American public an opportunity to review and comment on the White House website for five days.” Needless to say, he has broken that promise with almost every bill he has signed since.• Aided and abetted the “Arab Spring” which deposed existing secular governments across North Africa, leading to a regional power vacuum which was filled by Al Qaeda, the Muslim Brotherhood, and other hardline Islamists.• Refused to provide assistance or support the the earlier secular Iranian democracy uprising, allowing them to be crushed by the Islamic fundamentalist Iranian regime.• In his first months in office, Obama bowed to the king of Saudi Arabia, the president of China, the Emperor of Japan, and President of Mexico, among others.• Ordered NASA to make one of its top priorities not space exploration or scientific research but “Muslim outreach.”• Used Obamacare as a pretext to greatly increase the size and power of the IRS (which was given 16,000 new agents and additional mandates to penalize taxpayers for noncompliance).• Used the IRS to harass conservative businesses.• In the GM bailout, he illegally shortchanged investors who according to bankruptcy laws were first in line to be recompensed; instead, he gave their share to the unions.• Shut down oil drilling in the US, but then turned around and lent $2 billion to Brazil to support their government-controlled oil-drilling effort — and then promised the US would become one of Brazil’s biggest oil customers.• Sued Boeing in an effort to control where businesses could locate, kowtow to the unions, and block the creation of 1,000 jobs in South Carolina, a right-to-work (i.e. no forced unionization) state.• Adopted a longstanding Socialist political slogan, “Forward!”, as his 2012 campaign motto.• Sent insulting form letters to the familes of dead SEALs.• Neither disavowed nor distanced himself from anti-Romney campaign ads which threatened or implied violence against Republicans.• Shortly after the recent eruption of anti-American violence in North Africa, Obama went to Las Vegas to do his debate preparation in a hotel…with a romanticized North Africa theme.• Said in an interview that the Muslim call to prayer was “one of the prettiest sounds on earth at sunset.”• Union boss and far-left activist Andy Stern has visitied Obama in the White House at least 53 times, at last count — greater access than any other private citizen.• Hosted at the White House many Islamist members of groups associated with Hamas, the Muslim Brotherhood, etc.• Sponsored performances by and attended fundraisers with radical rappers like Michael Franti and Common, both of whose lyrics have in some cases been anti-police, anti-white, and anti-America.• Hired Timothy Geithner, who is documented as cheating on his own personal taxes, to be Secretary of the Treasury.• Told Joe “the Plumber” Wurzelbacher that it was good to “spread the wealth around.”• Told small business owners nationwide in a 2012 speech that “you didn’t build that” — implying that they should not claim credit for their own success, since taxpayers (i.e. themselves and other business owners) had funded the national infrastructure.• Insulted the British people by rudely returning to them a bust of Churchill which previously had been a ceremonial gift on display at the White House; when later confronted on this inexplicable action, he lied about it.• Canceled plans to complete a missile defense shield in Poland, a move which was highly praised by Russia — the very nation whose missile threat would have been neutralized if the shield had been completed.• By loudly publicizing (for personal political gain) the identity of exact SEAL teams who had killed Osama bin Laden, Obama made them a target for reprisals by Islamists; a short time later 22 SEALS were shot down and killed in Afghanistan, their worst loss of life ever.• Established an extra-Constitutional top secret “kill list” of people (including Americans) Obama claims the right to kill on sight, and then bragged about it publicly.• Set up a special email account, “Flag@Whitehouse.gov,” to which Americans were supposed to inform the government of anyone they heard spreading “disinformation” about Obama’s health care overhaul. (This was the first of three different “spy on your friends and neighbors” programs.)• “Attack Watch” was Obama’s second Big Brother attempt, a Web site on which you would report “attacks” on Obama’s proposals and ideology; it was quickly shut down due to outrage and mockery.• Finally, Obama set up the “Truth Team” program which encouraged citizens to report to the government any friends or relatives they hear repeating “lies” about Obama. The Truth Team site still exists.• Twisted the arms of defense contractors to not issue layoff notices in early November, so as to avoid causing bad news for Obama right before the election — even though federal law (the “WARN Act”) requires such notices.• After the attacks on American interests in North Africa on September 11, 2012, Obama gave a speech to the U.N. and declared “The future must not belong to those who slander The Prophet of Islam” — transferring the blame from the attackers onto the makers of a film trailer that supposedly “offended” the Islamists.• Repeatedly snubbed and got into public tiffs with Benjamin Netanyahu, who as the leader of Israel is supposed to be Obama’s closest colleague in international affairs.• On May 19, 2011, Obama told Israel they must return to the 1967 borders as a pre-condition for continuing talks with the Palestinians — even though the status of the borders was the main issue the talks were supposed to address.• Encouraged politically biased hiring practices in the Justice Department.• Soon after taking office, Obama rescinded the “Mexico City Policy,” which previously had banned NGOs which are supported by American taxpayer funds from using those funds to perform abortions in foreign countries.• Attempted to force returning veterans to pay huge increases for their health coverage…as a way to generate more funding for his Obamacare provisions.• In June of 2011, he anointed his own underage daughters as “senior staff members” so that their vacation to Africa would be paid for with taxpayer money.• Interviews with high school classmates revealed that Obama was a heavy and frequent user of marijuana in his teenage years (not to mention his self-admitted cocaine use in college).• Played over 100 rounds of golf during his first three years in office, meaning that he was on the links close to 10% of the days he has been president.• Voted to allow post-birth abortions (i.e. facilitating the deaths of babies who survive late-term abortions) not just once but three times in a row as an Illinois state senator.• The pastor whom Obama selected to give the national benediction at his 2009 inauguration recently declared that “all white people are going to Hxxx.”• Sided with Hugo Chavez and the Castro regime regarding the Honduran Constitutional Crisis of 2009, the first time ever that the U.S. formed a political alliance with socialist governments in Latin America.• Obama Administration OKed the nomination of Chas Freeman to chair the National Intelligence Council (which coordinates intelligence reports from all government agencies), despite the fact that he was openly hostile to Israel and strongly favored Arabist goals. (He later withdrew under pressure.)• Chinese pianist Lang Lang played an offensively anti-American song at a 2011 White House dinner where Obama hosted Chinese president Hu Jintao, to the delight and amazement of the communist Chinese visitors, while Obama just sat there and smiled (the song’s Chinese lyrics describe Americans as “warmongering jackals”).• There was a great deal of (still unverified) suspicion that the company LightSquared received favorable treatment from the Obama administration for approval of its broadband technology which interfered with the GPS system; an Air Force general claimed he was pressured by the Obama administration to downplay his criticism of LightSquared’s technology in sworn testimony.• Obama’s Department of Energy awarded $529 million to Fisker Automotive to build their Karma hybrid electric cars — even though they are manufactured in Finland, cost over $100,000 each, and tend to explode.• When Inspector General Gerald Walpin discovered during a 2009 investigation that one of Obama’s political allies (the mayor of Sacramento) was misusing government funds for personal gain, Obama unceremoniously fired Walpin — even though rooting out fraud was the job description of the Inspector General.• More than once Obama made so-called “recess appointments” when the Senate was not actually in recess, which directly violates Constitutional rules about how appointments must be made; in each case it was his way of getting his political allies into certain key positions without them being vetted or approved by the Senate, as required.• After Nidal Malik Hasan massacred 13 people at Fort Hood while shouting “Allahu Akbar” so as to become a martyr for Islam, the Obama administration refused to classify his action as “terrorism” and instead deemed it merely “workplace violence.”• Despite the fact that the Falkland Islands have been part of Great Britain since 1833 and that Great Britain is supposed to be our strongest ally, Obama essentially sided with Argentina in its new claim on the Falklands, not only by adopting the Argentine position that their status is open to negotiation, but even by (attempting to) refer to the islands by their Spanish name (Malvinas).• Convened the National Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform (a.k.a. the Simpson-Bowles commission) in order to address a major economic crisis…and then summarily dismissed and ignored their recommendations.• Criticized the Supreme Court’s legal reasoning (about the Citizen’s United decision) during a State of the Union address, which many considered a dangerous precedent as it appeared to place political pressure on the court, violating the Constitution’s separation of powers; but his bullying seems to have later paid off, when the Supreme Court apparently altered its Obamacare decision so as to not ruffle any political feathers.• On April 27, 2009, Obama’s staff (possibly at his direction) ordered Air Force One to make an unnecessary very low flight over part of Manhattan and the Statue of Liberty, which many residents mistakenly assumed must be a second 9/11 attack in progress; turned out that it was just a stunt to get a photo op of Obama’s plane next to the Statue of Liberty.• Obama somehow managed to insert mentions of himself into the official biographies of earlier presidents on the White House Web site — even presidents from the 19th century. After public outcry, the narcissistic Obama mentions were quietly removed without comment.• Intentionally misquotes the Declaration of Independence in speeches, often leaving out the words “by their Creator” in the famous passage “…are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights,” which Obama instead has recited as “…are endowed with certain unalienable rights.”• In June of 2009, Obama’s Solicitor General (and now Supreme Court Justice) Elena Kagan filed a legal brief to prevent the families of 9/11 victims from appealing their lawsuits against the Saudi royal family for financing the 9/11 attacks.• The 2009 National Christmas Tree in the White House was decorated with ornaments depicting Chairman Mao, a drag queen, and a picture of Mount Rushmore that included Obama’s own head next to George Washington’s.• Compelled Catholic and other religious organizations to provide health plans with free contraception, even though such requirements violate their rights of religious freedom and conscience.• It was revealed only after Obama became president that during the 1990s he was a leading member of the “New Party,” a socialist-aligned far-left radical group in Chicago.• Lied about his close associations with former Weather Underground terrorist Bill Ayers; pretended the two barely knew each other, when multiple sources document they were friends and close colleagues for years.• When Obama was inaugurated as President on January 20, 2009, he at first flubbed the oath of office, so he had to re-take it behind closed doors for his inauguration to be valid. He did so, but during this second, true inauguration in private, he purposely failed to place his hand on a Bible, as is traditional — the first president ever to not swear the oath of office on the Bible.• Obama’s own author bio in his literary agent’s catalog and on their Web site stated for 17 consecutive years that he was born in Kenya; this claim remained intact despite other portions of the bio being altered and updated repeatedly. It was only in 2007 after he decided to run for the presidency that the “born in Kenya” claim was taken down. The original info must necessarily have come from Obama himself; some theorize he likely falsely claimed foreign birth in order to gain admission or scholarships in college, and never bothered to fix his lie.• After winning the 2008 election but before being sworn in, Obama bombastically concocted the official-seeming “Office of the President-Elect” as if it was some kind of real government department; in fact, it was just a self-congratulatory title he made up to look important before he actually became president.• Obama administration came up with the bizarre euphemism “man-caused disasters” to describe acts of terrorism — because he wants to downplay terrorism as a significant political issue.• For three years in a row his official budget proposals to Congress received exactly zero votes — not even a single vote from Democrats.• Relied on an Islamic fundamentalist militia group called “The Martyrs of the February the 17th Revolution Brigade” to provide security at the American mission in Benghazi — and they not only failed to prevent the attack but perhaps even joined in on it.• During the debate over Obamacare in 2009, Obama bluntly stated that doctors like to perform amputations rather than practice preventive medicine for no other reason than that they make a greater profit from amputations. The American College of Surgeons demanded an apology, which never arrived.• Since 2008 the Los Angeles Times has been in possession of a videotape showing Obama honoring and praising anti-Western anti-Israel academic Edward Said, but they have steadfastly refused to release it to this day, for no discernible reason other than their belief it would damage Obama’s reputation.• When the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe recently held a conference on human rights, Obama sent an American representative — Salam al-Marayati, a Truther who blamed Israel for the 9/11 attacks and who also praises Hezbollah and Hamas. To the nations of Europe, al-Marayati spoke for all Americans on the topic of human rights.• Obama’s Department of Homeland Security specifically warned that Americans who are “dedicated to a single issue, such as opposition to abortion or immigration” are potential terrorists, as are libertarian-minded voters who “favor of state or local authority” over centralized power. These “rightwing extremists” (who hold political beliefs shared by a majority of Americans) are deemed a greater threat to the nation than actual revolutionaries or jihadists.• While campaigning in 2008 Obama declared that it was “unpatriotic” that Bush had increased the national debt at a rate of half a trillion dollars per year; but under Obama the rate of national debt increase has accelerated to almost three times the Bush rate ($6 trillion in new debt in under four years) — yet Obama has never apologized nor declared himself unpatriotic.• For decades, every president has attended a “daily intelligence briefing” which updates him on critical world events each morning. Obama has skipped 60% of his daily intelligence briefings, including the ones leading up to the attack in Benghazi.Footnotes[1] Hillary: Trump's 'Looking Backwards' Reality TV Style Worked in Less Sophisticated, Less Diverse Red States | Breitbart[2] http://‘What About Bill?’ Sexual...[3] Chicago ID card would be valid voter identification[4] Voter Fraud Case Reveals Deceased Texans Still Voting - Empower Texans	“I was diagnosed with ovarian cancer..and I won the battle with it.”Fast rewind 2 months from now, it was the time of diwali when suddenly one night, I suffered from severe stomach pain in the right side of my lower abdomen. The pain was impossible for me to take. I was shivering badly which came with the pain I still guess so, because I wasn’t having cold or fever anyway. But the next day the pain was gone. The whole day there wasn’t any feeling of pain or anything really, so I ignored thinking it to be due to indigestion or anything minor. But it returned again. And this time it was around 3am to 6:30am approximately. And it repeated for next 2..3 days continuously. Finally an aunt of mine advised me to go for a checkup as these kind of pain should not be taken lightly. She was a nurse and she doubted it to be appendicitis as all my symptoms matched with it. I had stomach pain that too in the right side. It was the symptom of appendicitis.The next day my father took an appointment to see the doctor, though I was not in a mood to go through a checkup because the pain did not come back from that night after my aunt advised me so. Though my mother insisted and we went to the doctor. The doctor checked my abdomen and advised me an ultra sound test. And the reports came to be a tumour like mass covered my right ovary which was of size 5–6cm. I was shocked. I had no symptoms of it and it reached to such size that there is no way left else than surgery for it to be taken out of me.My whole family was shaken at the report and father decided not to do any treatment here in Assam and we went Bangalore where my brother was staying. My brother searched for the best hospital for such a treatment and also the best doctor for the case. We listed out two amongst all - Manipal and Narayana. And we selected Narayana for the treatment. (I’m mentioning every detail of my hospital and doctor so that if there is any reader or your belonging suffering same, you can trust the hospital blindly and also the doctor who treated me..because I’m experienced and trust me its the best.) We met this doctor Dr. Rohit Raghunath Ranade, an oncologist, gynecologist at Narayana Mazumder Shaw medical centre, a unit of Narayana. I will tell you later why this hospital is the best and also the doctor.So we met him and discussed what has happened till now. I showed him the ultra sound reports and he asked me few questions like… do my periods come regularly? Do I feel irritation while urinating? Do I get the feeling of hunger normally? Do I get tired at every little walk or work I do? And when was the last time I got my period…. My every activity and body function was normal, I had none of the above problems he asked. He asked me to do some blood tests and an MRI ( Magnetic Resonance Imaging) and meet him the next day with the reports. He doubted it to be a cyst as there was no symptoms for it to be a major anything. We became so happy at the news though he was not sure about it still it was a relief for us to hear that as cyst is not a harmfull thing and it can be taken out through micro surgery.We did accordingly, went through several blood tests and an MRI. My blood reports came normal, there was nothing in my blood and the MRI was a bit difficult for us to understand. Still the blood reports were a sign for us that nothing major happened to me. My parents took a breath of relief at the reports and was confident enough to step in the chamber to see the doc. We were expecting to hear it from the doc that “there is nothing to be worried of she will be fine either of medicines or with a small micro surgery thats it”…We met the doc with reports and he went through it thoroughly. And coming to the result he started his lines wid it… Ok! Look Arpita,you need to be strong first… your blood reports came normal..but the MRI shows something else…the mass is not a cyst as c...
what exactly is mike 87  in layman  terms	what exactly is a framework in layman  terms	0	Net Neutrality is a new name for a very old regulatory regime (Economic Policy) designed to prevent monopolists and oligopolists from extracting Economic Rents (and thus Economic Profit) from the markets that they control.The historical name is Common Carrier. It dates to the early days of Railroads. When there’s one rail line and one railroad company serving your town, they’ve got control of the bulk transport service for your town, and they can bleed you economically.Imagine that railroad company decides that they’re going to charge you by the value of what you want to transport rather than simply its weight or bulk (i.e. Price by Value): transporting ten pounds (or kilos) of Diamonds is going to be much more expensive than transporting ten pounds (or kilos) of Lead (element), despite that the cost of doing so to the railroad company is the same.Common Carrier regulation prohibits that practice on the part of transportation carriers. Trucking companies are common carriers. So is the U.S. Postal Service.It’s not much of a stretch to see how this type of regulation also applies to telecommunications services just as much as to transportation of physical goods. Imagine that the telephone company charges you a percentage of the price of a pizza delivery order you make by calling a pizza parlor, rather than just the cost of connecting your voice to theirs. If you have little or no choice in your telephone service provider (so you can choose another one that doesn't zap you by the value of your calls), you’re stuck being bled by the telephone company. Probably the pizza parlor is being directly bled, too (and probably suffering a reduction in orders because the pizzas apparently cost more to the customers, even though the pizza parlor didn’t raise its prices).This model also applies to The Internet.In the USA, Internet Service Provider (ISP) provision of Internet service to most businesses and residences is now mostly owned by two classes of companies: the old telephone companies (e.g. AT&T, Verizon) and cable TV companies (e.g. Comcast, Time Warner Cable). Both of those industries have been disrupted by the digital (computer) revolution in that both telephone service and television can be converted to digital data (bits) and transported by digital data networks. Both types of companies have converted their networks from application-specific (only voice telephone, or only TV) to general purpose digital data networks.However, if everything is just bits (digital data), then a data network that can move (transport, deliver) bits can deliver everything. In that world, a cable network is the same as a telephone network: both can deliver telephone service, and television programming (and anything/everything else that’s digital (piles of bits)). Oops, now they’re competing with each other!Being a purveyor (business) selling a commodity product or service (they’re all the same) is terrible because when the Business Competition is intense enough, the Profit Margins are very thin. This is why Product Differentiation is so very important in those markets - why/how is your product or service better than everyone else’s? However, when all you’re doing is moving bits around, all you can differentiate on (aside from price) is how fast, how little latency, and network availability (e.g., cellular wireless network coverage).But just imagine if you could peek at the bits the customer is moving over your network and charge them more for more valuable bits?It would be like Fedex looking into the letter envelopes it delivers and charging a percentage of the value of stock certificates or written checks or the value of a business contract letter as opposed to the holiday card your mom sends you. There’s all this high-value stuff that they’re moving around - why can’t FedEx (or UPS or DHL or the USPS) take a piece of that value for moving it, instead of just charging cost plus for the weight and/or size and/or delivery speed of the letter?Because Common Carrier law says you can’t … if you’re subject to it.Guess why the Internet Service Providers want out from under that regulation?This is why Net Neutrality is very important to all customers of all ISPs (which is to say, in the modern age, everyone). The concept behind “neutrality” is to treat all data across all data networks the same, where “treat” in this case means “price.” No differential pricing for movies, or voice calls, or E-mail, or just bulk moving of data - all of them moved over the network at the same price for a given level of service (so many bits per second across the data network link).We need to put and keep the ISPs under the thumb of common carrier regulations, and force them to compete with each other on a commodity price basis for our business.We also need to undo as much of the laws that present Barriers to Entry to new competitors, e.g., if the ISPs won’t serve a given municipality adequately, why can’t the municipality dig up their own streets, lay down optical fiber, and operate their own network, while approaching the cross-country ISPs for interconnection to the rest of the Internet (negotiating one flat price for the whole town)? That’s illegal in many states because the ISPs went to state legislatures to get laws passed to make it illegal to compete with them.We need more competition between ISPs (and more of them), and we want to keep our flat-rate pricing for Internet service.If “net neutrality” (i.e., Common Carrier status & regulation) for ISPs goes away, expect them to gouge us all. In answer to those who believe “well, they would never do that” see the latter half of Here's everything you need to know about net neutrality and the FCC's plan to end it.See also You Don't Want ISPs to Innovate from Wired (magazine) in 2010. This argument is not new, and the old Common Carrier legal remedies against ISP monopolist/oligopolist behavior are not “out of date” or “archaic” - they’re entirely relevant and appropriate today as when that law was first written in the Communications Act of 1934.

where can i find a hacker for good cause	where can i find a good hacker	1	"Learning to become hacker is not as easy as learning to become a software developer. I realized this when I started looking for learning resources for simple hacking people do. Even to start doing the simplest hack on own, a hacker requires to have in depth knowledge of multiple topics. Some people recommend minimum knowledge of few programming languages like C, Python, HTML with Unix operating system concepts and networking knowledge is required to start learning hacking techniques. Though knowing a lot of things is required, it is not really enough for you to be a competent and successful hacker. You must have a passion and positive attitude towards problem solving. The security softwares are constantly evolving and therefore you must keep learning new things with a really fast pace. If you are thinking about ethical hacking as a career option, you may need to be prepared for a lot of hard/smart work. I hope these free resources will help you speed up on your learning. If you decide you pursue ethical hacking as a career option, you may also want to read some in depth ethical hacking books. A lot of people (including me before doing research for this article) think that they can become a hacker using some free hacking tools available on web. Its true that some common types of hacking can be easily done with help of tools, however doing it does not really make you a hacker. A true hacker is the one who can find a vulnerability and develop a tool to exploit and/or demonstrate it.Hacking is not only about knowing ""how things work"", but its about knowing ""why things work that way"" and ""how can we challenge it"". Below are some really useful hacking tutorials and resources you may want to explore in your journey of learning to hackHacking For Dummies - Beginners TutorialsThese tutorials are not really simple for anyone who is just starting to learn hacking techniques. However, these should be simple starting point for you. I am sure you have different opinion about complexity of each tutorial however advanced hacker are going to be calling this a job of script kiddie (beginner hacker).

what are some tips on making it through the job interview process at s  and  t bank	what are some tips on making it through the job interview process at at and t	0	I worked at Lockheed Martin for 25 years and was a Senior Manager for about 11 years.My advice is: 1) PREPARE beforehand, 2) BE HONEST during the interview, and 3) Dress professionally1) Many managers in Lockheed Martin are trained or familiar with something called the STAR interview method.S=Situation, T=Task, A=Action, R=ResultsInterviewing managers and teams will be looking to know what you’ve done in your past job. To give them a usable idea of your experience, you should be able to describe a particular situation, the task you were given, what actions you took, and the results of your actions.Prepare yourself to be able to describe several examples like this, within the context of your experience and the job you’re seeking at LM.2) Many of the facts in your resume and interview will be checked, such as college, degree, previous workplace, etc. If anything is found to be false or exaggerated you won’t be hired, or you’ll be fired after the fact if you are hired.3) It’s a standard recommendation to dress one level above the job you’re interviewing for. For professional/technical positions you should wear sport clothes, or suit, and tie for men and the equivalent for women.	Do your research. Find out who is in charge of hiring and ask to speak to them directly before the interview. Find out what they expect from a candidate to see if you would be a good fit. Maybe hang out at the local bar near by and meet some of the people that work there. Never hurts to have an inside man or woman working in your favor to get you hired. Ask about the hiring agents hobbies and learn up on them so you can talk to them about shared interests. If you know your job then what’s most important now is knowing the people there and talking to them about things they like. The work is less important then the people you work with and work for. Perhaps address the quality of service you will provide to the customers. Making customers happy is also a good thing.
what are the main imports and exports of venezuela and how does venezuela  industry compare to cuba 	what are the main imports and exports of venezuela and how does venezuela  industry compare to bolivia 	0	The main exports of Venezuela are two thing: Crude oil & Electricity.Although not as famous as Saudi Arabia, Venezuela is acutally has the biggest crude oil reserve around the world, 296 billion barral, while Saudi 265 billion, ranking No.2, and Iran 132.5 billion ranking 3. The reason why Saudi is so famous is that he is the biggest exporter of Crude oil around the world, and both Venezuela and Iran are unders economic sanctions. But among all the exports of Venezuela, crude oil still plays an critical role. In the year of 2015, crude oil export, with 27.8 billion USD, took 96% of the whole export amount of Venezuela.The second biggest export of Venezuela is electricity. In Venezuela, hydrau power station is the main way of electricity generating. But as this country owns abundant hydraulic resource, in the year 2010, he produced 116.7 billion KWH electricity, ranking 29 around the world. As comparation, Malaysia generated 116.7 billion,and Holland 114.8 billion. His nabour, Columbia, generated only 56.9 billions,and Peru only 34.8 billion.Regarding import, actually, this country imports everything.	Venezuela may be considered now a failing state. Despite Brazil’s current political and financial crisis, Venezuela’s 2016 GDP will be less than 10% of Brazil’s 2016 GDP.Venezuela is heavily dependent of it’s oil exports. Brazil also exports commodities like iron and cellulose, but has a much more developed economy, with dozens of automobile plants and other sophisticated industries. Embraer’s (a brazilian aerospace global player) revenues, as an example, are equivalent to 5% of Venezuela’s GDP. And the brazilian Petrobras revenues are almost the double of Venezuela GDP.
how did lucifer and gabrielle relate to each other	how do the roles of the cia the nsc and other related organizations differ from each other and relate to each other now and in the past	0	A life is made by love and as life begins it awaits it’s death, but to keep the life and love alive life has to make love to give another life.As simple as possible.	"Let's get to the root of this problem first. Why do you even feel inferior at all?You feel inferior, because society conditions us (women) to have pride in their looks and (men) in their money, which you don't have right now, by the general social standard.Admit it or not, this is the basic social conditioning since the inception of human society. Little emphasis is ever given to the intellect or empathy in a human, as the yardstick of social honour.Now, once you start to value your intellect, and the empathy—and if you think, you truly have some of these two qualities—you won't feel inferior against anything or anyone.Because intellect and empathy are the prime reasons behind the evolution of human beings, into the topmost position within animal kingdom. Physical beauty or financial abundance did not save human beings from a tiger or crocodile in those prehistoric jungle days. Intellect did. It solved problems. Empathy did. It bonded the human beings together to form the society itself.That’s why, regarding the contribution to the human civilization, intellect and empathy played a much bigger role, than the prettiness and money playing today. So, if you possess them, you should be ethically proud. Not to feel inferior in any case.We feel inferior, when we feel we don't have something that the ohers have. Once you value what you already have, and when you discover the real worth of what you have, you won't feel lagging behind much, in the social competitions for ""honor"".That’s simple.Now, Here comes the universal monologue : “Easier said than done,friend.”Alright.Remember the first day at school?Was it easy?Remember the first time when you were learning to write alphabet? A,B,C,D...The first mathematical lessons...how to multiply 56x78.First time you learned algebric expressions and solving equations..Was it easy?How many shots you had to take, just to write a single letter 'A', on paper, when you were just of age three? 100 shots were taken, after that you wrote: what looks like 'A' in some way. Then after 1 months of practice, you wrote--what you call ‘A’ today. And now you are writing a whole sentence with 26 alphabets, in just 30 secs.So, if you look back now to those early days of learning how to write alphabet--can you even imagine, what a super improvement you have achieved?At your three year old, if I told you—hey you are going to write a whole english paragraph on Quora one day—would you even believe me? At that time of first learning?Nothing is easy, at the start. Not even 2+2=4 is easy, when you first learned math. Multiplication tables of 9 and 7 were damn hard, when you first learned them.But now, you are a pro at this.Nobody has made you pro. It's you who did all the feat.What made you pro today? Even after repeated failure at that first day of math lesson.*Deliberate practice**And a little push for it everyday.* By our parents. Our school teachers etc.But after we cross 16-18, they stop pushing us, and let us grow in the manner as we wish.And, they expect, we will be able to push ourselves now.But, we don't push ourselves anymore. Instead, we get into a relaxed mode. The liberation mode. The freedom mode. Which kills our drive. The hunger to advance everyday. The hunger to try something new. Instead of becoming our own man, we become society's puppet.Then we say finally, as the society wants us to believe : easier said than done.Now, you may ask me : then, is everything is as easy as you seem to say?No.There is a strict classification in something which is easy, and which 'may' not be easy.Anything which is under your full control, is easy to initiate change.You want to change the country? Umm..not so easy may be. Success is not guaranteed.But you want to change yourself? Very easy. Just start. Success may be delayed, but guaranteed.You want your family to start something new..umm not easy.You yourself want to ..."

why is fahrenheit 451  perceived as dystopia	fahrenheit 451 1953 book what is guy montag  namesake	0	"Why are dystopian sci-fi novels like Fahrenheit 451, 1984, and Brave New world consider ""literary fiction"" while works like Dune, The Book of the New Sun and Foundation are dismissed as ""genre fiction""?"	"Bradbury didn't have anybody specific in mind when he came up with those names, but subconsciously, the ""Guy"" part was presumably from Guy Fawkes (Bradbury was in the habit of observing Guy Fawkes Day), and the last name Montag, was from Sigmund Montag, the founder of the National Pencil Company and the Montag Brothers Paper Company. The above letter is from http://io9.com/5865363/in-1964-r..., which Domhnall cited in his answer. Faber was also, according to Bradbury, subconsciously named after Faber-Castell, the pencil companyBradbury mentioned in one of his afterwords that he discovered this only after the book was published and hadn't intended any specific symbolism by the names. The following interview gives it in his own words. The name Montag comes about seven minutes in:"

how is the compensation system in uber	customer service what is uber  phone number	0	The most efficient CM should be picked upon how much has he delivered and how he has used the money that was given to him. Now there are 29 states in India and I am not aware about each and every one.My choice is going to be the Delhi CM because of the following developments:‘DJB revenue up despite subsidy’Turning around the Delhi power sector. When he became CM the DISCOMs were tottering at Rs 8000 Crore debt. In one year they were at Rs 435 Crore surplus (How did the AAP government turn around the power sector of Delhi?)DJB lays pipelines in record 217 colonies in 1 yearMinimizing the winter deaths.Opening 89 Mohalla Clinics, a concept which is being lauded in America - What New Delhi’s free clinics can teach America about fixing its broken health care systemOpening about 20 polyclincs.Providing guaranteed and free medicines and government outlets.For the first time in my knowledge the schools reduced the fees after hiking it.For the first time the surge pricing was suspended after a government took a stand against it - Odd-Even phase II: Uber, Ola withdraw surge price after govt warns of strong measuresFiring a corrupt minister LIVE!Focusing insanely on removing corruption at all levels - New Delhi: What are the steps taken by the AAP government against corruption and what have been the results?Focusing insanely on education sector:Stupendous teacher's training programBuilding 1000s of new class roomsBuilding up new infrastructure with lesser funds being spent than originally estimated. Although there are debates on this, we are so used to seeing a Rs 100 Crore flyover being finally built in 1000s of Crores. Even an ITI was built at a lesser than estimated cost (What's the truth about AAP government saving money in the construction of ITI Mangolpuri?)The Delhi Odd Even scheme was so well executed in Delhi, that not only it got international applaud, it even made Arvind Kejriwal one of the greatest world leaders for 2015! Arvind Kejriwal named among world’s 50 greatest leaders by FortuneThe only government ever in India that was able to give healthy compensation of Rs 20,000 per acre to affected farmers. This when it is so common for the compensation to be below Rs 100/- which is rather a cruel joke on the farmers.Sewer lines - This is being done below the RADAR (pun intended) of the national media. However when an official report is released, it would definitely shock everyone. The at which sewer lines are being laid is just insane!Making the state an e-State. Although Kerala won the race, perhaps because it started early, most of the work in the state is becoming online, with even certificates being provided online. Water bills can be created using a smartphone app and then be paid as well. The e-ration card is a good initiative as wellBus Marshals have reduced the crime against women to some extent.The tax collection rose heftily and Delhi is being made a case study on how to increase the tax collection - Tax collections strategy of the AAP govt in Delhi is a model that other state and central govts can replicate	"i m a frequent Uber customer for past 3 + years , it has it own pros and cons .But never realized its just impossible to make uber hear your complaintsThis is about my experience with UBER on 2 April 20181. I booked uber pool from Sai Chowk ,kukreja furnishing 20.33 PM (Costing 49Rs)1.a . I received 1 call from the driver at 20.39 asking for directions after almost 1.11 sec of me explaining the directions ). The driver when to opposite direction), I called him again to confirm he blamed Google soon as i disconnected the phone he cancelled the trip.(I have the proof in video + app shows it)Fine, I tried booking another cab, unfortunately, trip when to the same driver.Episode 2 starts.2. Again the same thing, I called him 20.41 we again decided to meet at some location.2.a After waiting for another 10 -15mins+ 2 call to explain him the address he finally agreed to come.2.b As soon as I disconnected the phone he again cancelled the trip .( i was completely unaware of he called the trip,as the phone was in my pocket)And I found him on the way when waved he stopped and said ""He has not cancelled the trip it was due to the system error"" ,I showed him Uber has deducted money from me (In uber app).He also said its a system mistake and agreed to drop me.we reached the destination at around 21.10PM ,now the tantrum started.The driver again demanded 50rs , And refused to let me get out of the car without paying. I insisted on not paying and calling customer care .He refused to call ,Finally asked me to call the drivers' customer care number 020-33992233 (Call timing 21.17PM)Customer care executive tried explaining the driver about letting me go , but he denied (executive also tried explaining him the calculations but he was just not in a mood of listening) also abused your customer care executive.First call did not result in to anything, Driver was still asking me to pay for the trip( i have already paid for the trip twice, with out any mistake of mine ) he refused to let me get out of car when I tried to get out of car he started the car and moved it ahead making it impossible to get out)finally, i decided to call customer care again, the same number ( this time diver refused to talk to Uber executive).When i tried to explain the situation of executive he refused to listen to me as i was a customer( i was actually hostage for good 20min for no fault of mine). and after that he started the verbal abuse, I have a video recording of his behavior with me (attached with this emaill) .Finally, i forced my way out of his car and came home.There are serious security questions here1. I was not allowed to get out of the car , for not paying extra money.2. I was charged 42.23 rs for the trips cancelled by a driver , Why I m charged for trips cancelled by the driver ( i have claimed this amount back from app )I need answers to following concerns1. What is ideally expected from the uber customer at this point.2. What action Uber will take on this driverafter reaching Uber from uber app , i got typical reply saying we will keep driver under surveillance for few days if this happens again we will take action . after producing all the proofs video + call records uber just give taking it too lightly ,are they waiting for Big mishap to happen ?"
is it feasible for flipkart to offer an emi on debit cards what are the different factors involved	is there any way to purchase a phone on emi via flipkart with only a debit card how	0	"First of all, you need to understand that EMI is not provided by flipkart or any other ecommerce player. It is the service of bank but interest rate can vary as according to merchant(in this case it is flipkart.)So, if you understand this now it should be clear that why there is no EMI service given on debit card. (as bank doesnt provide the facility)Now some Basics,Credit Card vs Debit CardCredit cardWhen credit card is assigned to you then bank takes a ""risk"" of not getting back the amount you spend on your card. As the amount you have spend on your card is yet to be paid, bank doesnt know that whether you will pay back the amount. Your credit card limit is LOAN you get from your bank. Debit cardNo risk in involved as the amount you spend is already present in your account and bank is assured of getting that money.Thats why we have verification for credit cards when you apply one but only saving account with minimum balance is needed in case of debit card.Now, apply this concept to EMI. As when you purchase something from credit card and if thats within your sanctioned limit, then bank agrees to give that LOAN to you and allows you to pay in EMI after charging interest.But when you prurchase from debit card, and if bank gives you the EMI then there is no guarantee that you will pay EMI as bank is not ready to take risk on you.EDIT:ICICI bank now provies EMI on debits cards but only when you have linked fixed deposits with your saving account. So, now bank is now taking risk on your fixed deposits and giving you the EMI's. Basics again remains the same"	Yes but conditions apply. The primary reason EMIs as a product are not offered on Debit Products is because Debit means pay nowCredit means pay later Credit Cards are provided to worthy individuals whose credit rating and other scores factor into a complex process of approval for a credit product  which is essentially an interest free loan for a period of 45-60 days for your purchases that cannot exceed your predefined credit limit Debit cards are provided to everyone who has a bank account as it draws directly from the money you have alreadyIt's possible however for Debit Card Holders to still be eligible for credit basis a fixed deposit that they have in their bank which can be used as a garunty for the bank in case you default on your paymentsThis is becoming mainstream though rather slowly, an example is here EMI on Debit Cards Please contact your bank and check your eligibility and ability to select EMI if available on your debit card~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~About me: This article expresses my personal views, and not those of any of my employers — past, present or future.Twitter: https://twitter.com/jasuja LinkedIn: http://www.linkedin.com/in/jasuja 
how do i define tasks vs milestones vs deliverables in an agile scrum methodology	what is agile and scrum model	0	The question sounds like it’s posed to figure out how to map traditional, waterfall project management concepts into a Scrum/Agile framework. The problem is, that’s not really how it works. Scrum and Agile project management are fundamentally different from traditional project management in that the process is specifically designed to be loosely-coupled to the objectives being pursued. The whole point of an Agile approach is that you’re not measuring your progress against some abstract project plan or Gantt chart, but instead based on delivering working software every sprint and through rapid iteration on the underlying work.If you had to map these concepts to Scrum, you could say that each iteration is its own “milestone”, in that you stop, review, and adjust/correct if necessary after every iteration. Similarly, your “deliverable” is the product backlog — but not in the sense of traditional project management where there’s a strict contract for delivery; rather, in the sense that the backlog represents everything that could be done, and is prioritized in a way that focuses the teams on doing the most important work first, followed by the next most important, etc. until we decide to ship what we’ve got working.Tasks are something entirely different — and in fact many Scrum teams don’t even track tasks. They take in user stories (requirements) every sprint, and as long as they deliver what they say they will at the end of the sprint, we as a business shouldn’t care how they did it. Tasks in traditional project management are what would be considered “waste” in lean manufacturing and Agile perspectives — they’re usually administrative records that someone wants to keep for some reason completely apart from building working product. Unless the team finds value in tracking work at a task level, it’s probably not important enough to insist on.	Agile ModelBefore going further, there is one question that comes to our minds.what do we mean by the word Agile.Agile is something which is quick and easy. Similarly when we talk about Software Development, Agile is referred to a task division into various phases of work and frequent reassessment and make changes as per the requirements during the Software Development. Below are the main advantages of using the Agile:1. CostUsing the incremental nature of Agile methodology provides one of the great benefits which means that features are delivered in short increments, thus enabling some of the benefits to be released early while the product continues to develop. Which also means that customer does not have to wait longer to see the whole product.2. QualityKey principle of agile development is that testing continues to happen throughout the software development, enabling testers to keep a regular eye on the working product. This continues testing process results in better results of the overall product.3. VisibilityIn Agile development process, active ‘user’ is closely involved throughout the product’s development which leads to a good collaborative approach from both the ends. This involvement provides an excellent visibility to the stakeholders, which in turn helps to ensure that expectations are effectively managed and in case there is any deviation from the requirements, it can be detected on early stages to make the changes.4. Risk ManagementSmall incremental releases makes the product more visible to the product owner and product team. This also helps to identify the issues at early stages and make it easier for the developer to apply the changes. The clear visibility to the product owner ensures that any necessary decisions can be taken care off at the earliest possible time frame which saves the product before it goes out in the market.5.FlexibilityAs we know that change is the only constant as one thing which is certain in life is only change. Similarly, agile provides us this flexibility to make the changes as per the upcoming trends during the software development cycle. In agile development, change is accepted at all the stages of development.Scrum ModelScrum model is a smaller part of Agile. It is a process framework for agile development, and the most widely-used in software development.Scrum is most often used to manage complex software and product development, using the iterative practice. Scrum mainly increases the overall productivity. Using the Scrum method processes, it becomes easier for the organizations to adapt smoothly with the rapidly-changing requirements, and thus produce a product that meets all the business goals. An agile Scrum process benefits the organization in following manner:Increased quality of the productAdjust better with changes (and expect the changes)Provide better estimates of the productMore control of the projectI hope that above provided information helped you in gaining more knowledge about Agile ans Scrum models. Being in a qa services organization, I have tried my best to share the actual facts with you.Thanks,Anand

Play with a friend, or try to beat your own personal best. Inhale deeply and then try and make a noise for as long as you can. Earn extra points for making your partner laugh or ending on an amusing note.Try to not think about penguins(Amusement Potential: 1-5 minutes)This is especially hard, because by trying too much, you remember what you were trying to avoid thinking of. If you try too little, you end up thinking about penguins anyway.Use your secret mind power(Amusement Potential: 5-10 minutes)Pick a passing by and try to use your mind power to command them do something, like drop their bag or knock into someone. The law of averages dictates that sooner or later one of your mind commands will come true, so you can convince yourself that you really have super human powers and waste even more time trying them out.Pretend you're a robot(Amusement Potential: 1-3 minutes)Walk down the street with mechanical movements, adding 'zzzzzt' sounds with each motion. Pretending to have a motor broken in, say, your left hand can add at least 30 seconds more entertainment.Scratch yourself(Amusement Potential: 1-3 minutes)Go ahead, scratch yourself now. Even if nothing itches, go ahead. Doesn't that feel pretty good?Rate passers by(Amusement Potential: 10-15 minutes)Secretly award passers by marks out of ten as you go along, offering (unsaid) expert criticism over their clothing, hairstyle and footwear choices.Repeat the same word over and over until it loses its meaning(Amusement Potential: 1-3 minutes)Pick a random word out of a magazine and say it aloud to yourself until it becomes a meaningless set of noises.Pinch yourself(Amusement Potential: 1-3 minutes)What is pain? Why is it unpleasant? There's nothing physical about it - it's all in your mind. Plus, after pinching yourself for awhile, boredom will seem nice next to being in pain.Try to swallow your tongue(Amusement Potential: 1-2 minutes)There's not much to say about this one. It is possible, but really stupid.Pretend to be a car(Amusement Potential: 5-10 minutes)Make appropriate revving noises in your head as you walk along and add a racing commentary as you pass strangers in the street. Use blinking eyes as indicators for extra authenticity.Make Star Trek door noises(Amusement Potential: 1-2 minutes)Stand by an electric door to a bank or something and make that silly ""Scccccccchwop"" sound heard whenever people popped on to the bridge to hang with Captain Kirk.Look at something for awhile, shut eyes, study after image(Amusement Potential: 2-5 minutes)Another great time waster. It takes about 30 seconds of staring to create an after image, and the image is then viewable for about the same length of time. Fun to combine this one with pushing on your eyes.Get yourself as nauseated as possible(Amusement Potential: 5-10 minutes)Best achieved by looking straight up and spinning around. Try to be so dizzy you can't even stand up. This is also entertaining due to the ""makes boredom seem a lot better"" effect (see ""Hurt Yourself"").Invent a weird twitch(Amusement Potential: 5-10 minutes)Adopt a bizarre twitch (e.g. flicking your head irregularly, twitching with eye or busting out sporadic cough noises) and try it out when you go shopping.Make a low buzzing noise(Amusement Potential: 15-30 minutes)Hours of fun in libraries! Keeping a totally straight face and looking nonchalant, make a low pitch humming/buzzing noise and see who reacts."	All I do is go to work at 8:00 and am home by 6:00 pm. The shops and other places in the city where I reside all close early. I watch TV and read and go to bed. What can I do to make my life more interesting?
where can i buy meldonium in canada	where can i buy meldonium in the us	0	MELDONIUM is Latvian drug not Russian and best to buy it from Latvia because EU laws are more stricter than Rus thus the quality is higher.Buy from LATVIA here : Meldonium Store, free worldwide shipping Express Shipping to CA takes 5–7 days.Electronics, Cars, Fashion, Collectibles, Coupons and More | eBay is NOT the best option.There are a lot of misleading listingsOnly 250mg are availableIf you must buy from Amazon than find a vendor which ships from Latvia so the shipping time is shorter and you will get quality product	Meldonium generally is not sold in United Sates and it is not approved by FDA and is banned by WADA. But it does not mean that one cant benefit from this medicine also it is worth mentioning that it has almost non possible side effects thus it is quite safe to use.In the past it was available on Ebay but now Ebay is actively deleting these listings.Potential users in US has to rely to overseas vendors and the best way is to buy from Latvian vendor since it is the country of origin.The biggest manufacturer is Grindeks. One of the Latvian vendors is Meldonium Store , they add official English instructions with the product.
what would be a cool way to commit suicide	what can be the most insane ways to commit suicide	1	My daughter went through this, too. She wore size 0 jeans but had D cup breasts. She was made fun of by others girls who accused her of “stuffing.” She finally got fed up in the locker room one day while changing and showed the girls her breasts to prove she didn’t stuff. They reported her for exposing herself (even though they were in the girls’ locker room changing for PE…)SHE is the one who got in trouble. Kids will make fun of other kids because of their own insecurities, to get the focus off of themselves and their own shortcomings. They will also make fun of others because they think it makes themselves look “cool” or “tough” and gets the attention of other students. Whatever the reason, no matter how harmless it seems to adults, it is still a form of bullying and should be brought to the attention of the school. As adults, we can think of things to say and more creative ways to handle these situations, but kids can be devastated by this kind of bullying. Bullying in any form can have serious effects on the person who is being bullied. There have been kids who have dropped out of school because of the incessant bullying at school. Others have gone as far as to commit suicide because of being bullied and harassed by their peers. As trivial as it may seem, I would address it with the school before it esculates into a worse problem. If the school does not help, go to the board of education and demand that something be done. This will not only reinforce to your daughter that you care enough to get involved, but it was also help bring attention to the bullying issue and send a message that bullying in ANY form is NOT okay and will NOT be tolerated. How you handle it all depends on how seriously you take the issue and how far you are willing to go to stop it. Some people will bauk and say my suggestions are stupid, overkill, etc. They may be right. But in my opinion, if it is serious enough that your daughter doesn’t want to go to school because of being bullied, then it is serious enough that it is interfering with her life and her daily activities and should be addressed.	I saw this picture a while back on my social media and thought that it would be perfect for a question like this. (although some aspects of this are slightly untrue)Nazi GermanyTroops: Some of the best trained men in the war. They were know for their extreme discipline and respect to authority and custom. Engagements with Nazis were rarely ever an easy fight.Production: Germany still to this day is revered as a nation of engineers. Infact, they often had a habit of over engineering things. They had freaking crazy tanks and aircraft, but these were often hard to repair in the field due to their complexity. The average everyday mechanic would struggle.Their engineering was so good, in fact, that they actually invented the concept of stealth bombing (although never actually tested it in flight)(Replica of Nazi blueprints for the “Wing Plane”)USATroops: As listed above, they were known for their unpredictability. Unpredictability can be taken the wrong way if you aren’t careful. What this means, is that American troops were remarkably flexible. Individual officers could easily change the method of attack of their men. This made the Americans hard to predict. The US also intentionally made machines easy to fix, easy enough where any guy with a hammer could fix them.Production: The US had the strongest economy at the time. They utilized the competition and intuition of the free market to create some of the most insane weapons ever in MASSIVE quantities (Boeing B-29s, P-51Ds, Atomic Bombs, ect…) The free market also gave America HUGE supplies of everything. Germans would often comment on how they would see American troops with just piles and piles of everything.(B-29, extreme high-altitude bomber, in mass production)USSRTroops: Hardened, but poorly trained and terribly equipped. The USSR would often just send in waves after waves of men. The amount of casualties were devastating. Russia is often criticized for their lack of value for human life. Sometimes soldiers were tossed into battles with no rifle and told “When the man in front of you dies, grab his”.Production: The depression was kicking Russia’s ass. Socialism wasn’t helping. The soviets were often deprived of food and supplies, so early on in the war, America sent some P-40s (planes) over to help them. The Russian pilots actually did pretty well though, earning multiple “Ace” pilots on these planes.(Russian Troops)JapanTroops: The most motivated in the entire war. They based their military discipline off of the “Bushido Code” which stated that anyone who surrenders doesn’t deserve to live. (this also explains terrible treatments of both US and Chinese POWs” This is also the exact reason why the US dropped the bombs. Pres. Truman knew this. He thought that the Japanese would fight until every old man, child, and woman had died. They would fight down to to their teeth and nails.Production: Light but maneuverable. Their planes, especially the Zero, were known to be extremely quick and agile, but very easy to destroy once hit. Their production almost entirely stopped due to American B-29 bombings on their factories. This lack of production and Bushido Code explains Kamikaze bombers. People willing to commit suicide to sink a single ship for their nation. And lack of planes to do a whole, formal formation.I could go further, but it’s 12:00 am where I live, and I have school tomorrow.:D Hope you all enjoyed reading!!EDIT- See those lats two bullet points? Good! This is a light-hearted post.Please remember that this is an opinionated answer to a question that asked for common generalizations of militaries at time. This was not published to offend anyone.ALSO… many people have commented on how I didn't do every nation. Sorry. I wrote these around midnight, And did the first that came to mind.

do you have any paranormal experience	what are your best paranormal experiences	0	What's the most inexplicable experience you've ever had, whether supernatural, paranormal, bizarre coincidence, mysterious intuition, prophetic dream, or unexpected lab result?	It happened back in 2002 . I don’t know what should I call it a ghostly experience or a paranormal.From Kolhapur, we were heading to a village called Guhagar. The road was narrow and going through hilly area. It was around 9 pm. We were riding a Yamaha RX100 bike.It was going to take another couple of hours to reach to the destination.A road was something like this.We decided to wait for a while to smoke. As it was dark and hilly area, we decided to stop for a very short time. We found a mile stone which stated that we are still 59 kms. away from the destination.We stopped and my friend smoked (I don’t smoke). I told my friend to drive bit faster so that we can reach sooner and find a hotel to stay.We started again, after driving for another half an hour in almost straight direction, my friend suddenly stopped the bike. I asked him the reason.He said “Abhi, did you notice something ?”Me :- No, what is it ?Him :- Isn’t it the same place we stopped half an hour ago ?I noticed the same mile stone and cigarette stub he smoked.Shit ! What is this ? We did not take a turn, we were driving in a straight direction. Now it was almost 09:45 and we are still 59 kms away from the destination.A cold wave ran through my spine, I hastily ran towards bike and asked my friend to start it and leave this place ASAP.Now, we were still to face the nightmare.Again after driving for 20–25 minutes we reached to the same spot.Oh my god ! What’s going on ? We were driving like in circle and reaching no where. We did not understand that without taking a turn or riding in circular direction, how we reached to the same spot twice ?It was too creepy.We prayed and begged for mercy to the lord. And started again, miraculously, we reached to the destination after an hour and half.Next morning I spoke with some local guys about this, they said that many people have experienced it at the same spot where we did.I don’t know what that was, but surely creepy one though !*****Edit 1On the way back, I curiously looked for the same mile stone to figure out whether it was done as a mischief by someone. But I could only find one mile stone.
which 2g band 9001800mhz was sold during 2g spectrum scam	what exactly is the vyapam scam why have so many died because of it	0	Yes I agree that the tariffs would increase by as high as 6-7%. Excessive bidding by the telcos have benefited the government but ultimately the cost would pass on to the consumers. To avoid the increase in tariffs, the government can use reverse bidding concept. In such a case, the government may fix a price for the spectrum, and may call for bids from the telcos on the basis of lower and lower tariffs that they would be charging after allocation of spectrum. In such a case, the telcos would try to keep the tariffs as low as possible. In the current scenario, although TRAI is controlling the prices of telecom service, but due to high spectrum prices and a high cost of capital thereon, the prices are bound to increase.	"Munna Bhai MBBS.Yes getting admission by fraud is not new, however it actually became a big issue (sort of big) when almost 100 fake docs got admission in MP PMT in 2011 100 fake doctors? Madhya Pradesh hit by Munnabhai scam - The Times of India Probe was started in 2011 knowing that ""some"" admissions are fake, no one ever imagined that Vyapam officials are involved in this and all we thought its just another Munnabhai case.  During the course of investigation in 2013 it finally emerged that this is going to be one of the biggest scam in India as ""Vypam Scam"". In an interview in Dec 2013 to TOI former CM  Uma Bharti said: ""There can be names that will shake the state. I would, therefore, request chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan to hand over investigations of the case to the CBI or else this kind of conspiracies like singling out Uma Bharati from a huge like of references will take place. Investigation can be influenced under political pressure if the case remains under the state police"" . What is Vyapam Scam: VYPAM: Madhya Pradesh Vyavsayik Pareeksha Mandal (Vyapam) which conducts tests for professional courses and recruitment to various posts like MBBS, BE etc. To get admission in Government Medical collages in MP fraud was conducted in multiples  ways:Type 1. A middlemen arranged for high-scoring students to impersonate applicants during the exams, while paying officials and invigilators to look the other way. Type 2: In these cases, invigilators were bribed to allow certain applicants to sit next to impersonators so they could cheat easily.Type 3: In such instances, applicants apparently left their answer sheets blank, to be filled up later on the basis of the marks they were given.The result is common - To get fake doctors [imagine 2000 fake doctors in your city, will you take your kid to hospital? do you have any other option?It's a massive scam worth  approx some $1 billion (Rs6,300 crore) and include every one from students their parents, middlemen and lower officials, and political parties, some very shocking news came in Feb 2014""Chauhan involved in Vyapam scam; Kin of staff of RSS chief got job: Katare"" - http://www.freepressjournal.in/c... As the investigation continue by STF (State Task Force), we have seen ""suspicious"" deaths for those who were involved in it. 46 deaths related to the scam have been reported so far, many of them under suspicious circumstances.Some questions: 1. Why government is not going for CBI probe, even when it was demanded by former CM and Congress?2. Why students and family members involved in this are not communicating to Media, till now NOT a single interview on this?3.  What about talented youths who appeared in Vyapam examinations and got rejected?(I want to be alive so writing anonymous)"
i am a straight a student but have no motivation or will whatsoever to go to school can someone help me fight this	my fianc nonascii e died recently and it pains my heart how do i learn to cope with this	0	Why would we want to help our competitors? If you can’t compete, why would I want to assist you? When you fail, we succeed and that is what life is all about. Life is not for losers. We can’t help you because we are busy helping ourselves. If we help you, then there will be less pieces of the pie to share so it benefits no one when we help you to defeat us. This is why there are millions of people like you asking the same question but no one will help because we are all struggling like you to survive and get ahead and get that piece of “cake” that will satisfy our cravings.So when people like you say that school is “hard” for you to attend…… You show me that you do not have what it takes to win, survive and make a better life for yourself. You are saying that you are a quitter. Go ahead, do you really think someone will care when you drop out? That means more room for us winners. Think about it. Everyone is not designed to make it. Are you one of them?	My fiancé died in a car accident. I am listening to our recordings, looking at our pictures and old texts. I can't live like this; it's so painful. My heart's going to explode.

which is the best shares to purchase and sale daily trading	in sydney which company would be the best to get advice for business sales  and  purchases	0	When it comes to intraday trading there are no best shares. Intraday trading generally is a high risk busness. A good trader pics a share after 30 mins of market opening and always trades with stop loss and never takes delivery if his trade runs into losses (Always use stop loss). For intraday trading a share has to be highly volatile which means heavy buying or selling. Lastly a trader should also have some technical knowledge to read the direction of shares like candlestick analysis, moving average etc ...Most importantly one has to be emotionally detach with any trade he take as share market doesn't work on emotions. if you are new in intraday trading and you pick any share without basic technical analysis then be ready to take losses.

i and my girlfriends private partstouched each othercan she become pregenant	why most of the cosmetic products do not  have price tags	0	"Don't avoid arguments. Differences are good, but make sure you have a healthy relationship. A healthy relationship's foundation lies in trust, good communication & respect. How do you build a foundation like this? Let's start with the individual. The individualKnow who you are and what you want in life (identity). This creates a stronger you. A stronger you will be less affected by other people's moods and you will be more likely to be able to make a decision that builds on your personal growth. Knowing who you are and where you want to go, makes a more stable (consistent) you. A consistent you creates the building block for trust. People get to know you, because you behave in a consistent manner.  Your moody girlfriendThere are various reasons why your girlfriend can be moody (I haven't heard of a 24/7 menstrual cycle and men also get moody from hormonal fluctuations), so don't assume it is hormonal. If you think it is hormonal, calibrate her behaviour with other people. Has she also responded ""moody and mad"" with other people? If no, then maybe the problem she has, is with you. Either way, you two need to communicate better. Good CommunicationMen in general don't like this stage, because it requires them to properly communicate their feelings and thoughts; a skill that they haven't developed since childhood like women and therefore leaves them vulnerable. Good communication is about talking and listening (usually it is more about listening).  If you know who you are and where you going, you will have an idea of what you expect in your relationship. Can you share this with her? Does she ""listen"" (respect) to what you have to say? Can she share the same with you? There should always be a channel available between two people in a relationship (just like a parent will always be there for his/her child when he has done something wrong). A relationship is a partnership and without an open communication channel, you open yourself up to a world of miscommunication, misperceptions, jealousy, anger, fear and disrespectful behaviour. Before you know it, a little thing like a raised eyebrow, resulted in you breaking up. Bad communication affects trust. RespectValuing your partner for his or her opinions and differences, allows for the opportunity for good communication and builds on your trust levels. Respect affects all interpersonal relationships in life; even broader life (spiritual & nature). Not only do you have to respect others, you have to respect yourself. Never do or say things that disrespects your ""self"". It affects your identity, which in turns (once again) affects trust. So don't continuously tolerate her ""moody and mad"" behaviour. Know when to call it out. Emotional MaturityUnfortunately, we are not born with these abilities. We have to practise them. In our younger years we are more affected by our emotional states (due to hormones and brain growth), but this should never be accepted as a justification or excuse. Learning proper introspection and good communication skills can happen regardless of biological fluctuations. We emotionally mature through trying, failing and making better choices. So practise your three skills on your girlfriend. It will make you a better man for her and if not, for your next girlfriend. Sometimes the other person isn't in the same ""place"" as you are in life. That is ok. We all have our own journeys. Have the guts to move on. The more you become the person you want to be, the more you will draw people to you that are like-minded."

could we use cherenkov atmosphere radiation with gamma rays or similar to image the surface of a planet from here with ground based telescopes	can we map the surface and the subsurface of a planet using cosmic rays or very high frequency gamma rays with ground based telescopes	1	I have not come across earth based Gamma ray telescopes.Cosmic rays (made mostly of protons 90% and alpha particles - 9%) are mostly created by supernovas, and sometimes by jets from blazars (active galactic neuclii -AGNs, whose polar jets are pointed at the Earth.) These are hard enough to detect; Cosmic rays will be absorbed by planets - with very little collateral radiation bounced off (and that too in the Gamma range). So it is highly unlikely to receive gamma rays reflected by an exoplanet with enough intensity to be able to detect it on earth.Regarding gamma ray reflections -Since cosmic rays are relatively rare, but a cosmic ray bust can be detected in a multi-square km area, Crayfis has been arming smartphones w/ cameras with an app for detecting cosmic rays: https://crayfis.io/about.It would probably be interesting to turn some datacenters (especially academic and government funded labs) into detectors as well, after all, neutrons in alpha particles in cosmic rays have been attributed to cause memory bit flips (leading to the use of ECC and interleaved memory.)

Christina Grimme http://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/s...	The Blue Hole near Danhub is very dangerous for a number of reasons.Firstly it has a lot of traffic. If you said that diving or deep diving carried a risk, and gave it a value, the chance of something going wrong is that probability multiplied by the number of dives. Even really safe sites can record fatalities if there are sufficient dives there.The other issues with the site are related to water depth, clarity and the famous arch.With water depth there can be problems with nitrogen narcosis and at depths approaching 60 metres problems with oxygen toxicity. Deep water is very appealing to some people. I am sure we all know divers who want to be the deepest person on a dive. Sadly it doesn't matter how tough you are, depth will always win.Water clarity and depth together is a problem. Clear water can make things closer, smaller and generally more accessible. I remember the first few times I was in really clear deep water, I found myself looking at something below and seemingly in no time I was right on top of it having descended another 15 or 20m. I was at that time a very experienced diver regularly diving to 50m and had I not been so conditioned might have been in some bother. It was both surprising and potentially dangerous to have found myself being drawn in like that. The Blue Hole has great visibility and sufficient depth that people might easily find themselves deeper and more narcotised than expected and I have seen people dangerously narcotised at quite modest depths. People do odd things when they are narcotised. I have seen people getting disorientated in terms of direction and bolting into deeper water rather than heading up, taking their regulator out of their mouth etc Seriously narcotised people have a fair chance of not making it back to the surface.The final lure in the Blue Hole is the arch.

what is the best age to teach a child how to swim	when is a good time to teach your children how to swim	1	I teach swimming from six months up to adulthood. Even though I teach parent-child classes because I cannot choose which classes I will and will not teach at my facilities, I do not recommend them. “Learn to swim” courses are very subtly different from “Parent-and-child aquatics” in that swimming strokes are really not taught at this level. It is really about getting comfortable in the water and bonding with the parents; the education is geared toward the parent so that they can encourage their child to learn.My suggestion is for parents (I am assuming parents who swim, not non-swimmers themselves) to skip this class and opt for spending time with their children in the water with them, showing them that you enjoy the water and care that they have fun in it too. It does not matter what you do with them; if you want an agenda, parent-child classes are essentially kicking on the front and back, trailing them behind you to let them glide, trying to blow bubbles, trying to paddle the hands. As long as they are getting comfortable in the water, they are accomplishing the goals of this class.(In Red Cross, there are overlaps between the levels. For example, someone who did Preschool classes might skip Learn-to-Swim level 1 onto level 2, as learn-to-swim starts with the same skills but at a school-age.)So I’d aim for 3–4 years old, skipping infancy onto the preschool years.

what would cause an amp to cut out	what would cause an amp to cut out how do you fix it	1	That depends on a lot of factors and many possible scenarios.The most common cause is the operator. Get someone who actually knows what they are doing and things may start working again.Another possible cause could be a blown speaker. A blown voice coil can short circuit or have much lower impedance.Another possible cause could be improper speaker connection and/or a set of speakers that do not match the amp impedance limit. Too many loudspeakers connected to the same channel, will do the trick if not properly connected in a series/parallel setup that will keep the impedance within the amps limit.Another probable cause could be “clipping” a form of distortion that will eventually blow the loudspeaker coils and after the amp end stage. Or when the amp has Clipping protection circuit.Another possible scenario could be heat. Improper amp ventilation can do the trick too (provided the amp has thermal protection circuit)Another possible scenario would be “amp starvation”. Improper power supply and grounding can do the trick.Another possible scenario could be faulty components in the amp either on the power supply or the end stage or bothThere are plenty of possible scenarios and it is difficult to point out one with the very small info you have on your answer. But, as I mentioned above, it all starts with the user. Change the user and things may change. Today people just want loud and louder.

how do i score good marks in mathematics	how do i score good marks in mathematics 9 cbse	1	There are mainly two type of peoples1.who loves maths…..These type of persons are very enthusiastic and curious about see the different type of maths problem and try to solve it no metter how challenging it is!!!Thus all who are very familiar with maths and their basic concepts and fundamental are clear once they have to try to find out that from where these concept came from ,why it is exist and how it's been proven and it's application.Now you are ready with perfect background of principle,theorem and formulas etc.Using all of these start working on as much problems as you can which is in your syllabus.Remember one thing that maths is never improve hand in your poket.Make a habit of writing problems in not books with perfection.sometimes you get a answer with a different techniques not down these techniques….its useful in MCQ type question!In paper always doing calculation based on marks.Math is subject where you have to maintain speed and accuracy both.Give full attention to problem and not down carefully what is given in exam,what is asked?Now by these method if your exam will be of 100 marks then you are work hard and by heart you damn sure get 95 to 97 marksNow you want perfect 100 here is your tipsyou have to predict that your paper examiner are one who don't know everything in maths.Because maths is subject where we can get a answer in many ways sometime which is not understand by every one.Actually during practice we have bed habit to skip some steps and directly get the answer. Never doing it during practice if you want perfect 100 you have write a single step which is needed to prove your answer correct.During exam we are so busy that our whole focus on getting answer. So when we are writing answers we don't look at How are we writing? Maths having a very big integration,series,derivatives etc. So try to writer maximum 3 terms in line next term in next line .These way you can also easily get answer and able to find out anything goes wrong easily.If ther is series in which sin,Sinh ..cos,cosh term will be there one line having only 2 term so when you have to cancle something it's easier.All symbols use properly like +,~,%,=,{,}[,] ,- etc.Your answer key should be neat and clean.Advantag of these tips is sometimes your are doing mistake and still somehow you get a right answer in that case examiner can only see you are answer and perfection you got a full marks.These way when somebody see your answer key it's look like everything nice clean and perfect .2. Who hate maths….I think these type of students are bored when they have to calculate somethings or they have a fear of maths.Basic maths not clear thought they practice maths problems they are very confuse what to do next because and after a long half hour they don't even solve a one easy problems.Without basics you can't doing anything.thus they have to start from the bottom. And then when you think you have little bit intrested then you gradually like maths afterwards you have to follow1.who loves maths	First of all be Thorough with each and every questions and concept given in the NCERT book. Do all the questions of the NCERT atleast twice. Now that you can score 80% Marks easily as most of the paper is based on the NCERT move on to other books like U-Like. Attempt the sample and model test papers given in the book. Set a timer and do the sample papers as you will do in the final exam. By doing this you will get the feel of the paper and would able to know your strengths and weaknesses.Practice as many questions as you can and you will surely do good.Good luck!

what are the chances of ww3	is there any possibility of a ww3	1	Everyone always says there is no chance of this happening these days but fail to realize that we are drifting into a geopolitical atmosphere eerily familiar to that of the atmosphere before WW1 broke out.. in my honest opinion we are one miscalculation, one mistake, one unjustified invasion away from our “enemies” (Russia and China) throwing their hands up in the air in regards to the UN Security Council and total war breaking out. It’s what the USA and it’s “allies” seem to be pushing for at every attempt acting without UN approval and failing to allow a UN investigation happen which is the law and Russia seems to keep wanting to play it by the books in every instance I’ve seen in this regard.. this is the 3rd time this chemical shit has happend. It seems as if someone is deliberately trying to start a war here with this. Or justify there reason for being present in Syria? Just a week ago trump was talking about pulling out HA!	Here is the state of the world now (only highlights).North Korea- Has missiles and Nukes in its stockpile. Their missiles do not have enough range to reach continental US. Even if they somehow manage to strike a few Nukes at the US, it will only affect the impact zones immediately. So it will result in the total wipe out of NK in the US’s retaliation. North does not want to nuke the south coz their first goal is to take over the south and unite the Koreas. It does not want to attack any of its neighbors simply because there are no compelling reasons to do so for North. So there’s no real threat.Russia- She has a lot of technologically advanced weapons. Some even better than the US. She has a stock pile of Nukes and intercontinental ballistic missiles. But they have one thing working against them. Their own economy. Their economy is weak. They cannot keep the supplies alive to support an all out war or an invasion. No place can be dominated or occupied without boots on the ground. So there’s no real threat.China- She has the largest army. Lot of hardware, strong economy, many missiles and long history as well. What is working against them is their size and their political leadership. Most of the weapons in their arsenal are old and reverse engineered stuff from the Soviet era. They are modernizing however, but not at the rates they want. Also their navy and air force does not have enough hardware to back an invasion. So no real threat.India- Certainly a large number of people, large army. Relatively modern Air force and Navy. India is historically peaceful and non-aggressive they have stood their ground against aggressors but never pushed back. Also the air force does not have the infrastructure to support an invasion. Navy has inadequate number of modern vessels. Submarine fleet is aging. Modernization is happening at a snail’s pace. Political leadership is not helping with the process either. So no real threat.Europe- Collectively, very powerful and has strategic advantage over the rest of the world due to sheer strength and size of hardware of individual members and the collective strategic knowledge and experience. However, Europe is not as united as they wish to be. Member nations have trust issues with each other due to leftover emotions from previous two world wars. Also there is an impending financial crisis and a social crisis due to the refugee movement. So no real threat.Africa-Individual nations(some of them) may be strong enough to defend own territories against invaders, however none of the African nations are strong enough to launch a war or an invasion against even their Asian neighbors; let alone European or American. Also, most of the continent is torn apart by countless civil wars, racial and tribal conflicts and regional disputes. There is not enough reasons for an outward spill-over of the conflicts. So no real threat.South America- Same as Africa. Third world countries, slow or crippled economies, poverty, smaller, largely inadequate military forces. There are no compelling reasons for them to cause a large scale conflict, let alone global. So no real threat.Middle East- There are a few who can put up a real tough fight against an invading foreign military.Their situational awareness, familiarity with terrain and guerrilla tactics are all advantageous but only works withing the region so they are only good at defense. Certain countries possess good hardware and moderately large modern armed forces. However, none of the Middle Eastern countries possess the military strength to lead an invasion on foreign land or sustain the defense of their own territories for a long time (including Iran). Also they are not synonymous with the modern equipment that they possess. This is because of lack of experience in large scale multi-face, multi-theater warfare and lack of trust between troops. This seriously undermines the collective efforts. So no real threat.Last but not least,USA- Uncle Sam checks off all items on the list when it comes to size, numbers and weaponry. Certainly strong, economy wise. Has a global reach and has lead countless invasions, successfully. They are already the dominating force and has a firm hand of control over the world with many military bases in strategic locations across the entire planet. She is ruling the world now, at least by a big margin (Economically, politically and strategically). So she wouldn’t do anything that would start a third world war and cause a global meltdown. Because once the world goes in to the chaos of war, the balance of power might tip against them. Off course she will get involved in many other small scale conflicts, trying to bring down a dictatorship or install a new one, home-delivering freedom and democracy to the needful. Still, no real threat.Unless something dramatic plays out anytime soon or some nut job decides to let some nukes loose willy-nilly, we are certainly not heading towards a third world war. So just relax and have a cold beer.

i took some moocs before college and now i feel like college is horrid what do i do	is toshiba satellite c50a547 good for runing games	0	Honestly, get over it.MOOCs are great because they open the content up to so many people. The teachers are trying to engage so many people at once that they have to be creative, innovative, and enthusiastic. They work hard to expand your mind, show you how awesome learning is, and use state-of-the-art technology to illustrate opaque concepts. It's like having a Michelin star chef offer you a small piece of a light, airy cheesecake that's rich and decadent with a vibrant fresh-picked ripe fruit topping that's bursting with flavor but not overly sweet. It melts in your mouth, isn't heavy, excites your tastebuds, and leaves you craving more.The problem here is that now it's hard to eat $0.10 ramen noodles after that. Even a decent pot roast will pale in comparison. The cheesecake was good enough that you've been ruined somehow because 99% of things you'll have will never measure up. You could try to only eat at Michelin restaurants now on, but you may not have the opportunity to do that. It's hard to accept, but now you may be facing a long hard stretch of culinary mediocrity.That's the best comparison I can draw to education. There are a lot of mediocre professors out there. Lots. Some do it because they like the material, some want to inspire, but some never wanted to go into the real world and love the safety of academia, and some didn't have a plan so they kept going to school until they couldn't anymore. MOOCs are usually given by teachers who wanted to teach and inspire and have a flair for presenting, not unlike a great chef. However, there are a lot of cooks and chefs that just make some decent dishes because they're paid to do it. End of story.The professors that teach MOOCs are genuinely excited about their materials. However, it's very different outside of that group. Some professors have been teaching the same class in the same way for *decades*. I personally learned from a senior professor that taught a 100 level engineering course to another senior professor when that one was an undergrad. He’d been teaching the basics for 40+ years. After 80+ semesters, the magic of the material is gone. There's no excitement left. How many semesters would it take you before you stopped seeing the material as exciting? It may be very nice to have professionally drawn graphics and learning content on perfect slides with beautifully styled fonts, but you're missing the point. The point isn't to entertain you, it's to educate you. If you're getting hung up on the presenting method, you're not focusing on the right thing.MOOC professors don't have the same pressures to grade their attendees’ work. I read the figure is 90% of MOOC attendees drop out of the course. Even if they do grade the work, there's no pressure for certification. Sure, a MOOC may give you a certificate, but is that enough to get a job with? I would think not. Most professors have to consider that the university would get a horrible reputation if they passed too many people that performed poorly in the working world. In the US, accreditation is everything and a school will do a lot not to lose its accreditation. A degree means a lot more than a certification.You've had a good learning experience with a MOOC. That's great. But come on, a traditional university course is *not* like you're being poisoned, like you said. The professor’s job is to teach the material, not to make it exciting and engaging. Lectures always beat the hell out of reading the textbook for me, even though I did my fair share of that. It may not have been the most fun or exciting, but I learned something, which was why I was there.	You’re far more qualified than any non-owner to answer this. Does it still do what you need it to? Is it as fast as it was when you bought it? Does it not run programs you now need it to? Is this just a weird geek macho pursuit involving a circle of friend(s)? If it no longer does what you need it to then it may be time to upgrade, If it still functions fine, then consider keeping it. Is it a case of it running much slower than it did? Then it may just need cleaning up S/W wise. Be aware that if it’s slow because of S/W you’ve loaded … there’s every chance a new one will run similarly as a result of your wanting to load it with S/W.If it’s lacking H/W features that you want ie; larger screen, DVD/RW, etc … It may be time to upgrade. RAM and HDD’s can be upgraded (for the most part) inexpensively. I tend to shell out extra $ when buying a laptop simply so it will be strong enough to run what I want for the next 5–6 years. Right now I’m using an Asus Gaming series that I paid over a grand for maybe 6 years ago. I don’t plan on replacing it soon, barring mechanical failures.I hope I managed to answer your question somewhere in the rambling tirade provided. If you’re happy with it? Keep it.

what are the differences between hindustani classical music and carnatic music	what is the difference between thaats and ragas in hindustani classical music	0	"Hindustani and Carnatic music systems are comparable to two species that have evolved from a common ancestor. So it helps to describe the nature of their 'ancestor' first and then show how the two systems evolved into distinct branches.The common ancestor of Carnatic and HindustaniThe history of Indian music can be traced to 200 BC - 400 BC - when Bharatha Muni, a Musicologist, wrote down a basic theory of Music (and dance and drama) called ""Natya shastra'. Under this system:there were 22 notes in an octave.primtive elements of 'taal' or meter were also identified.the concept of 'sruti' was introduced to allow people to choose a convenient reference 'root' pitch based on the singers'/musicians' convenience.A set of 'bhavas' (or expressions) and 'rasas' (the evoked feelings) were identifed.A musical grammar theorized which of these 22 notes for any chosen 'sruti' will sound in harmony or in dissonance (somewhat similar to pythagorean rules, except this is all relative) with the sruti.Using these grammatical rules, primitive recipes called 'ragas' were formed each specifically designed to evoke one of the 'rasas' (or combinations thereof). These 'raga' recipes would comprise a chosen set of notes from the 22 total available notes.The ragas also evolved to prescribe many other details - such as how to transition from one note to another while ascending (aroh) and descending (avaroh) or what 'phrases' are quick formulae to evoke what specific complex derivative rasas.  Thus, with the formation of Natya shastra, the Indian system of music was set in motion. It is important to keep in mind that around this period India was a place of prosperity that welcomed travelers from across the world. Music kept evolving, organically as new cultures were met and assimilated.The speciation of Carnatic music / Hindustani musicAfter several years of the Mughals entering the nation, most of the then-existing Hindu kings had already been chased down south as the Mughal empire and culture spread across North India. The prevalent system of music kept constantly evolving under the 'selection pressure' of the mughal rulers - which had a persian/mughal bias. Somewhere around this time, a need was felt (by the hindu kings of the era) to 'standardize' the original musical system that used to be in existence[1]. Thus, if we imagined two kingdoms - the ""Hindustan"" (the one that was occupied by the mughals) and the ""Carnatic"" (the one occupied by the remaining hindu kings of the south). Hence the names ""Carnatic"" and ""Hindustani"".The way Carnatic and Hindustani diverged was mainly through an organized effort to make Carnatic ""different"", while Hindustani continued to evolve in myriad unorganized, organic ways.The effort took place in Thanjavur (then Carnatic empire, now Tamil Nadu) originating with Raghunatha Nayak stating something on the following lines[2]: ""The listener hearing the recitals by different musicians is certainly  puzzled to know what raga is being rendered as no two musicians sing the  same raga alike. There is such a diversity of rendering that one cannot  even recognize the well-known ragas. Most musicians, barring a few, do  not conform to the definition or grammar of each raga as expounded in  authoritative treatises. To put it bluntly, no musician seems to follow  the sangita sastra for there is no correlation between the lakshana and  lakshya and yet they call it Carnatic music.""Raghunatha wanted to have a standard to prescribe and preserve the ancient traditions. He wrote down the earliest draft of this in his book ""Sangita Sudha"". At this point, one Mr.Venkatamakhi, the son of Raghunatha's music teacher reads ""Sangita Sudha"" and gets influenced. Later, Raghunatha Nayak's son Vijaya Raghava Nayak undertook the task set forth by his dad to formalize and make ""Carnatic music"". He chose Venkatamakhi to do this work. Venkatamakhi comes up with the elegant ""Melakarta"" scheme.Further advances by the mughal empire forces the Carnatic form of music to evolve a ""hindu religious"" tradition and a form of ""hindu identity"". Around this time, the Trinity (Muthuswamy Dikshitar, Tyagaraja and Syama Sastri) besides the many other carnatic composers created tens of thousands of ""kritis"" or compositions. These compositions were mostly religious by nature and these compositions themselves defined Carnatic Music.Thanjavur becomes the capital of this tradition as the Maratha kings experiment fusion with western forms of music (king Serfoji who was well traveled marveled at the western method of music whose power, he rightly identified, was due its written form). He even set in motion an effort to give written notation to carnatic - but the effort gets abandoned as the british abolished princely states in one sweep.The carnatic artists and their families who had flourished in the ensuing 300 or so years of Carnatic's evolution, switched base to Madras to entertain their new western masters.In the early days of the formation of the ""Madras Music Academy"", performance traditions were experimented with by artists such as Ariyakudi Ramanuja Iyengar, Semmangudi Srinivasa Iyer and others where the format of a concert or the method of expounding and improvizing kritis were defined to a 'ticket buying' audience.All along, Hindustani music kept evolving Organically.[1] ""A Social History of Music in South India"" by Lakshmi Subramanian http://www.amazon.com/Tanjore-Co...[2] http://tamilartsacademy.com/arti..."	Thaat:Thaat is a system of organization and classification of Raagas of Indian Classical Music. In past, many musicians tried to classify the Raagas into categories. The modern Thaat system was created by Pt. Vishnu Narayan Bhatkhande (1860-1936), one of the most influential musicologists of Hindustani Classical Music. According to Pt. Bhatkhande, each one of the several traditional Raagas is based on, or is a variation of, ten basic Thaats.These ten thaats are Bilawal, Kalyan, Khamaj, Bhairav, Poorvi, Marwa, Kafi, Asavari, Bhairavi and Todi.Raag or Raaga:The melody with an overall mood or environment producing a lasting impression while entertaining or recreating the audience. A combination of different musical notes or Swaras in a particular sequence of ascending and descending makes a Raag.
how can we solve the issue of kashmir	why nothing is done to solve kashmir issue	0	Four things:Communicate with absolute clarity that the unity and integrity of India is non-negotiable. No discussion - No dialogue - Nothing grey or floating.Declare article 370 as invalid through an ordinance - let the state integrate with the rest of the country - just like all other parts of the nation.Remove AFSPA in stages - Give freedom and enable the local police and the administration to deal with separatism as a law and order issue (just like Punjab). Investigate and bring charge sheets in every alleged and actual case of atrocity reported - provide transparent justice.Simply release the internet search history and browsing data of the separatist leaders of Kashmir - dry up their illegitimate sources of funding - Continue to provide incentives for the regular people to live peacefully.India will never be divided on the basis of religion again - whatever be the cost.Thank you for reading. Cheers and peace.	Super try is going on by this Government. Strict action is taken against Anti National people. Curfew imposed is now more than 60 days.

Tired of Curfew many kashmiri people are likely to move out of Kashmir, they will be resettled in different states. Again changes of demographics will be there. Seperatists leaders not getting world wide support has broken there moral. That's again a superb strategy. Pakistan is avoided. And Pakistan has failed to help Seperatists leaders.Kashmir problem will be resolved in 2 to 3 years. This is law and order problem. India has got its way.
do you think of mathematics as art or science	is math an art or a science	1	"Many have taken the view of Hardy that “mathematical reality lies outside of us, that our function is to discover or observe it, and that the theorems which we prove, and which we describe grandiloquently as our ‘creations,’ are simply our notes of our observations.“ This makes mathematics sounds like a science studying the natural world, and certainly we often speak of mathematical objects as it they are real objects that exist somewhere, but this view introduces the very hard questions of where does this mathematical reality exist and why is it that logical proof is our means of observing it.Others, especially more recently, have argued that mathematics is less like the natural sciences and more like the arts; that is, mathematical theorems aren’t discovered, they’re invented. This allows us to understand Weierstrass’s statement that “the true mathematician is a poet.” While capturing the sense of creativity present in producing modern mathematics, the idea that mathematics is entirely a human construct faces some serious challenges which are well communicated by Eugene Wigner in his remarkable paper, The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Mathematics in the Natural Sciences. If mathematics is a human creation, why does it do such a stellar job at describing the many diverse phenomena of the natural world? I find the idea of a garden very helpful. A garden is both discovered and created. The plants present existed in nature already, but the way in which they are brought together, arranged, and cultivated reflects the human gardeners.A similar story can be told of mathematics: we begin with ideas that appear very naturally within nature, then, as rational beings, we interact with creation by rationally extending these ideas.Perhaps, as has been said before, ""God gave us the integers, all the rest is the work of man."" Wherever you draw the line, it seems that parts of math (say, arithmetic) are in some sense forced upon us from the natural world, while there remains the clear sense that human freedom and creativity are involved as we handle and extend these ideas.Now, I believe Wigner was right that there remains a mystery here. Why are we able to handle these ideas in a way that doesn't lead us into a web of contradiction? Moreover, why does it remain useful in describing the natural world after human creativity has clearly had its role? For instance, the introduction of imaginary numbers were simply to satisfy the curiosity of mathematicians, and yet many have argued that modern physics cannot be formulated without imaginary numbers. We just thought them up, but they very well may be essential to understand the universe. Many other such examples abound, such as non-Euclidean geometry.It must be that just as we are deeply curious and creative, we are also deeply mathematical. And so is the universe."

which is the best book to understand special relativity	what is the best book for selflearning special and general theory of relativity what are some beginner and advanced level books on these topics	0	I read Tompkins in wonderland.Though I was familiar with most of the stuff (HUGE thanks to youtube lectures, which you should do. most of the stuff is explained very well there.)The book is well written and designed in a very simple way. language is lucid.The best thing of the book was it was written at time when there were only few people who understood the theory. And at that time this guy wrote the whole book and also explained everything nicely.P.S. Youtube lectures really help alot.Popular Videos - Theory of RelativityLecture Collection | Special Relativity	There are a great number of really excellent books on relativity, but no particular book is good for everyone: the reader is as important as that which is being read.To be honest I imagine that self-learning relativity to be quite difficult. It will take a lot of practice and patience working through the problems and quite a few years before becoming proficient.

how does specific heat and heat capacity differ	is heat capacity the same as specific heat	1	I see from the answers already here that there is ambiguity about what heat capacity refers to. Everyone agrees about specific heat. My own connotation of heat capacity is that is is the amount of heat needed to raise the temperature of an object by one degree. Specific heat would be the heat capacity divided by the mass of the object. So the two things have different units.Heat capacity is in, for example, J/KSpecific heat would be in J/kg-KThis link (heat capacity | physics) agrees with my interpretation, although it uses calories per gram instead of joules per kilogram. But conceptually these are the same.If you use the expression “heat capacity” I suggest making it clear which interpretation you mean in order to avoid the ambiguity. If you said “heat capacity of this substance” that would clearly mean specific heat, and if you said “total heat capacity of this object” that would also be fairly unambiguous, but if you said “heat capacity of this object” it might be interpreted by the listener as either. If you gave the units, then that would make it clear which one you meant.	I see from the answers already here that there is ambiguity about what heat capacity refers to.

what are plan a and plan b in interstellar	when voldemort is resurrected in book 4 he was saying to the death eaters that his most loyal servant is doing his job at hogwarts to whom was he referring severus snape or barty crouch jr as madeye	0	"— Thanks for A2A—***SPOILER ALERT***Basically, In the film Interstellar, The main characters are pursuing Plan B to save and protect the humanity/mankind, whereby a human colony will be established via frozen embryos. At the end, Brandt (Anne Hathaway) is left alone on the colony.Plan A :- The wormhole and gravitational anomalies are obviously artificial. This means that direct spacetime manipulation - true control of gravity - is possible. If this is the case, the energy cost of lifting things into space would drop dramatically. We could build immense starships that could simply float into the sky with antigravity devices. NASA then has two goals: first, to use data gathered from the gravitational anomalies to figure out how to control gravity (Dr. Brand's department), and second, to build the ship itself. If successful, all remaining humans could board the Station Fleet and depart for a new habitable planet on the other side of the wormhole.Plan B :- While gravity control seems to be possible, it may still be beyond the reach of our technology. In that case, the goal switches to saving humanity as a species, not the actual humans on Earth. The spacecraft Endurance will be sent through the wormhole carrying a ""population bomb"" of 5000 frozen zygotes along with the equipment necessary to create a self-sustaining colony. This colony, established on a sufficiently Earth-like world, will be the start of a new human civilization in the alien galaxy. Those on Earth will have to be left behind, as their case is hopeless.Unbeknownst to NASA and the crew of the Endurance, Professor Brandt (Michael Caine) never intended Plan A to be a viable option. He used Plan A as a means to motivate funding to NASA and to eventually leave the Endurance crew with no choice other than to implement Plan B.Professor Brandt considered Plan A to be impossible because in order to solve his gravity equation, he would need unobtainable data from the Singularity of a black hole. He wanted to to conceal this fact from everybody, including his daughter Amelia and Murph. For years he pretended to be attempting to solve the gravity equation with Murph, despite the fact he had previously determined it was unsolvable before the Lazarus Mission left Earth, ten years before the Endurance.On his deathbed, Professor Brandt finally admitted to Murph that Plan A was a ruse. This prompted Murph(Jessica Chastain) to send a message her father, accusing him of being aware of the lie and abandoning her to die on Earth. This proved to be a revelation to the entire Endurance crew, but not to Dr. Mann (Matt Damon).Then Cooper(Matthew McConaughey) and TARS sacrifice themselves to allow Dr. Brandt to begin Plan B on Edmunds' planet. TARS was tasked to enter Gargantua, glimpse the singularity, and relay the data back to Earth, giving humanity a chance to initiate Plan A. TARS was ultimately unable to transmit to Earth due to the black hole's immense gravity. However, Cooper and TARS entered the Tesseract and were able to relay the quantum data to Murph using the watch Cooper gave to Murph before leaving Earth. Plan A is implied to be successful as Murph's completion of Brand's gravity equation allowed the launch of very large space stations to depart from Earth, one being Cooper Station, named after Murph.Source : Google"	When Voldemort was resurrected, he spoke of three living Death Eaters who were not present.“And here we have six missing Death Eaters … three dead in my service. One, too cowardly to return … he will pay. One, who I believe has left me forever … he will be killed, of course … and one, who remains my most faithful servant, and who has already reentered my service.”The faithful Death Eater was Barty Crouch Jnr of course, disguised as Alastor Moody. Aside from him describing himself as “perhaps the most faithful of all”, he had been already been working on Voldemort’s scheme to kidnap Harry for a whole school year.There is some discussion that Crouch was merely caught up in events and didn't deserve the same punishment as the Lestranges. I think those who feel that way have merely succumbed to his charm the way his mother had. Just listen to his description of how he felt when he escaped Azkaban:“When I had recovered my strength, I thought only of finding my master … of returning to his service.”Crouch tortured the Longbottoms for Voldemort’s location, he manipulated his own mother to be released from Azkaban, killed his father, and then followed Voldemort’s intricate plan for a whole school year to get Harry into Voldemort’s hands.Without a shadow of a doubt, Crouch was the faithful Death Eater Voldemort mentioned.Adapted from: Yin Shan Ho's answer to Who was Voldemort's faithful servant?

which book should i prefer for maths class12 preparation ncert or elements with just a month left for boards	can biological complexity be computed to a particular mathematical value and is it irreducible	0	Well with this short time in hand, you should not look for any other book to prepare the maths, just revise the concepts of each and every chapter again,and keep solving Example Question given before every exercise.But, if you still want to refer something, i would like to suggest two things to you:Look for Blueprint sheet given to teachers by the CBSE, which have 10 sample question papers in it. Practice each one of them daily and in the time frame.This will give you a handy time management in the maths exam.you have to ask your teacher for the same(as i think its sort of meant only for the teachers).Evergreen 100% Success i referred this book for sample papers to practice for the exam. this book contains every possible question that have possibility of being asked in CBSE exam.I wish you luck for the exam.Just believe in yourself,and remember Math is fun.PS: I have 100/100 in CBSE 10th Exam(and completed the exam in 2 hours and 15 mins approx,which was scheduled of 3 Hrs.)	Well, if you are looking to master your English grammar, then take out atleast 15 minutes to read the following post about how you can actually start to speak and write in English.Yes, by the time, you will read the post, your basics will be clear to a great extent, provided that you show seriousness.English is important in any field. So, if you are the masters in it, then potentially you can reach the zenith earlier, as compared to others. Therefore, it is important to polish skills.In the following article, I am sharing my experiences of how I mastered over this language in a full fledged way along with giving easy and practical steps which will help bloggers towards polishing the same as well.My passion for enhancing English skills grew from my childhood days as I was in early years of my schooling. Till I was in class 6th, my English was not even upto the mark then. I used to get punishment from teachers as well as parents for failing to get requisite marks in any subject and English was not an exception.Also read : How to get bank Jobs fast after 12th and Graduation in Govt or Pvt sectorHowever, soon I got counseling from one of my uncles who equally happened to be a HOD in Government Polytechnic. He is a really nice man. I must say. He gave me enough reasons to polish my English, since all other subjects are primarily based on English as well. So, if I will improve my English, I can equally be able to have a better control over other subjects too. That was the day which proved to be a change for me.Although, I was able to understand to what others used to speak, yet I couldn’t communicate with them in English and I believe that most of us face such predicament. Isn’t it?You might not believe that it was the reality that I used to bring all the English dailies in the morning such as “Times of India”, “Hindustan Times”, “Pioneer” and the list goes on and on.I am telling from my own personal experience that the difference which I found in these English newspapers is that “Pioneer” offers comparably easy use of words. Therefore, initially, I would recommend this newspaper for those who want to learn skills of English. Because, when I say easy use of words, I mean as compared to other English dailies.I used to closely monitor the words which my teachers use. More so, when it comes to English subject, I used to learn a lot many words. I still remember that I learnt the word “Enthusiasm” and the way it should be used.Read : How to polish English skills – Third PostIf you though that by learning words, you can use them also, then you are wrong. Since, you have to use them at their appropriate place at their appropriate form. For example,How enthusiasm and happiness can be used. Lets find out.I am enthusiasm or I am happiness (wrong)I am an enthusiastic person (used as adjective) (or if we want to use the word “Enthusiasm” then we can sayI am full of enthusiasm (used as noun)I am happy (used as noun)I am full of happiness (used as adjective)I can’t go in detail about whole grammar in the post though. But can help you out, if you have any queries.I equally persuaded my uncle to give tuitions to me of English and he obliged. He made it a point of giving an “Essays” and “Letters” to write on daily basis which I have to complete anyhow and show to him the next evening. My passion started growing when I started seeing the pleasant change.When I used to read newspapers, I made it a point of writing the words which I did not know the meaning of. That gave me enough reasons to strengthen my vocabulary as well. How can I miss watching English news channels? As I said that it became my passion, so I used to get enjoyment by watching news channels and I equally used to closely monitor the way certain words were pronounced. Since, that’s equally matter as well.Read : How to polish your English- Third postI made it a point to listen news wit...
movie review what is your review of aamir khan  dangal 2016 movie	what is your honest review of dangal 2016 movie	1	So its 25 December, day of Christmas and few days before NEW YEAR.Movie launched on the silver screens just at the right time. Yes out of all the Bollywood movies I saw this year, this movie really comes under a category to be appreciated .2016 was a year of BIOPICS!!! yes Sarbajit, M.S Dhoni and now DANGAL.I am not a movie critic but as an honest viewer I rate this movie 9/10.Yes I am rating it a bit high, but it deserves this score.I would like to list out the points I loved while watching this piece of cinematography.Starting from the starting, I loved the simple things shown in the movie, like a person adjusting the antenna to catch the signals, it reminded of the my childhood days.Best part is the narration in the movie, yes I fell in love with this idea of the director.The actor playing the dangal sister’s cousin have done a stupendous work.This movie exactly portraits how people in India in fact families are entangled in love,the care of her mother the sacrifices made by all the people around to help the girls grow.This movie is a combination of good jokes at times and full of emotional moments.The movie keeps your mind and heart intact till the end.

what do you think about the movie interstellar	what do you think about the movie interstellar	1	In the movie Interstellar, it's a pretty big flaw that Cooper hardly gets credit for what he's gone through even after Murph tries to tell everybody that it was her dad. What do you think about that?	"★★Interstellar is Christopher Nolan’s love letter to Stanley Kubrick’s 2001 - too obviously so - from the repeated HAL jokes to the score similarities to the use of monoliths to the total destruction of narrative as the film progresses.  It's also a counterpart to 2001 - a humanistic take that tries to say ""No! we don't need aliens, we can do it ourselves.""It's also a space movie that becomes less interesting once they get to space.SPOILERS FOLLOWThe film starts off quite wonderfully.  There is fake documentary footage using actors that are old enough that they could be talking about the dust bowl that ravaged the Great Plains in the 1930s, but they aren’t, they are describing the events of the film.  The film conveys a message that means a lot to me - that we’re a society drifting away from our roots as explorers.  McConaughey’s character, Cooper, says “we used to look up and wonder, but now we just look down at our place in the dirt.”  We learn that Cooper is a former pilot but now is a farmer, a widower with two kids.  A blight is infecting crops around the world.  It has devastated the wheat crops and is working on okra.  The farmers are surviving on corn.  Through the intervention of a strange gravitometric anomaly, Cooper meets a secret NASA team that is planning a mission to save the world.So far, so good.  It’s dramatic, well produced, the cast is good.  Then Michael Caine appears and Michael Caine makes everything better.  Anne Hathaway shows up with the weird kid from American Beauty.  They have a plan A and a plan B.  Plan B is to prevent extinction of the species by having a small team of astronauts take thousands of fertilized human embryos (don’t ask me where NASA got those) through a wormhole that has appeared near Saturn, to another galaxy that might have a planet that isn’t experiencing a dust bowl.  If that sounds wacky, wait until you hear plan A - to take the people of Earth through that wormhole.  Apparently the big round CONCRETE building NASA is hiding out in is a spaceship that can rotate to provide artificial gravity and ferry the people of Earth to Saturn.  Who was the science advisor for this film?Cooper was apparently a great pilot, but to his own admission only “stratospheric”, and yet somehow he is the best person they can find and super qualified to pilot a spaceship.  He, Anne, American Beauty kid, and a black scientist… wait, a black guy in a science fiction film… they wouldn’t use that cliche would they?  Why, yes, they would.  Sigh.  His days are numbered.  Speaking of which, has anyone else noticed that whenever The Walking Dead introduces a new black character, they have to kill one of the other black characters?  Just saying.Sorry, back to Interstellar.  Anyway, these four launch from an underground “launch chamber” in a giant Saturn V type rocket that in reality would have been destroyed by its own acoustic energy reverberating in a confined tube.  The space scenes are gorgeous, silent, vast.  Well, silent except for the screeching 150 dB organ music straight from 2001. Our heroes cross through this convenient wormhole and start to track the beacons of the dozen ships that were sent ahead to scout for planets.  There’s one small complication, though.  There’s a giant black hole named Gargantua that these planets orbit.  Getting too near the black hole entails relativistic velocities that would mean for every hour they spend checking out planet one, seven years will pass back on Earth.  But apparently the small shuttlecraft (and its pilot, who isn’t actually an astronaut) can make massive, fuel-sucking maneuvers to avoid approaching the black hole until they reach the planet.Planet one is ""on the cusp"" of the black hole.  We don't know where the star is that is providing the bright daylight on the planet.  The visit to planet one doesn’t go so well.  So it’s time for a sta..."
what goes through a guy  mind when he touches his girlfriend  ass	why does a man raise his hand at his wifegirlfriend what goes through his mind	0	A2A.(I imagine you meant caressing the butt)When I am caressing my girlfriend's ass, I'm feeling the bumps and crevices, moles and birthmarks and I am admiring her curvy butt. I am definitely a butt and boob guy so the butt has to be curvy and proportionate to the rest of her body. I am trying to press her body against mine.I'm thinking about the rest of her body when I am caressing her butt. I'm thinking about her thighs, I'm thinking about the butt cleavage, I'm thinking about her navel, I'm thinking about her breasts and the way her nipples are.. In short, I am creating a mind map of her body and my mind is racing and I want her right now. I want to undress her and I want to go down on her. I want to kiss her inner thighs and I want to pleasure her to the hilt. 	Nothing but anger and rage goes through their mind according to several of my clients. It is sad when you see that so many of these people controlled their anger at the people that upset them, their bosses, other employees, their parents or some friend. Then they go home mad or get mad at just about anything and explode on their significant other.I’ve heard several answers why they feel they can hold it till they get to their significant other. I’ve heard that they maight get fired if it was at work. (Which is ridiculous that someone can plan to get mad at a person in particular every time they get mad. That shows some choices and self control). Another answer is that the other person should know what is expected. If we could be God to know every need and thing that the other person needs. Let alone, that some people come home just to explode or wait for the other person to say or even look wrong at that person. There are some people who fly off the handle with anyone too. I just see more people who choose to only abuse their significant others.No one should take it. It’s sad because I’ve seen people who were advocates for the people being abused, and then turn around and get into the same position later on. They know the signs. We can become blind when it comes to our selves.That is why we should be aware, observe and inform someone if we see this happening to them. It really helps when the abuser only hurts one person. That is when it shows they are controlling who they hurt. The victims usually realize it at this point when they are reminded.
from my symptoms how do i decide if i have a urinary tract infection	what causes the burning sensation in a urinary tract infection	0	Based upon what you’ve stated in the details of the question, you must be feeling very ill and uncomfortable. And I hope that by the time of this response, that you were able to seek out the assistance of medical professionals that have helped get these serious symptoms under control and you’re feeling better. Soliciting assistance from an online community for urgent health matters is not the most efficient way to get relief and on the road to your normal good health. Fever and pain should not be allowed to linger or progress and those two things alone are enough to warrant medical advice.Urinary Tract Infection (UTI) is a common occurrence for women who are having, or recently following their menstrual cycle. Doctors say that theoretically “no” there isn’t a correlation between the UTI and menstruation, but most women who have studied this topic tend to disagree with what doctors report. And, older women who have passed the age of menstruation and younger girls who have not had their first period are also frequently afflicted. Nearly 10 million doctor visits each year, world wide, are due to different urine infection symptoms.A UTI has the hallmark symptom of a frequent urge to urinate and if the urge is followed by actual elimination, because often the urge will only a produce a few drops, the elimination of urine will bring on a burning sensation and it may be red or cloudy in nature. Often experienced is a change in the smell or a bad odor from the urine. Some patients also experience pain in the lower abdomen and back.When a UTI progresses and moves from the bladder, to also affect the kidneys (Pyelonephritis), the additional symptoms of fever and chills, body aches and pains, and possible nausea and vomiting will occur. This is a serious condition and medical attention is needed as soon as possible.It is important to quickly diagnose and treat a possible UTI. If you haven’t done so already, please see a medical provider. Your healthcare provider can run a quick test in the office to determine the presence of bacteria in the urine and then discuss with you the need for a urine culture. Tests strips of this type are also available over the counter in the US, but this is only for diagnosis and not treatment. A bacterial culture of the urine is the most effective way to determine the proper antibiotic necessary to clear the infection from your system. Use of an antibiotic targeted for the type of bacteria causing the UTI, will deliver the best results.When you’re feeling better, take a look at this very helpful website covering all the things anyone would need to know about UTIs: Urine Infection or Urinary Tract InfectionsI hope you’re feeling better soon and can then begin the search for a combination of food and supplements and hygiene that will keep future UTIs from reoccurring.

It is mostly seen in females but males also can develop it. It prostatic obstruction or stones, urinary tract infection can occur. Acute UTI is generally related to sexual activities. He will further explain the cause for recurrent infections too.Check more at: https://www.medtalks.in/FAQ
what food should i eat to gain weight	how could i gain weight in a healthy way	0	Fast metabolism system can be reason behind this. You must consume more calories than average person. Eat protein rich, carb and essential fats containing food.You must follow this :- Best Diet Plan To Gain WeightAlso Read:- Top 5 Yoga Poses To Gain Weight That Actually WorksSome more methods and tips to gain weight:-1. Know ThyselfNo one likes to count calories, but one of the fastest ways to gain weight is to know how many calories you need, and how much you are eating on a daily basis.I’ve heard many skinny guys – and girls – say that they are eating so much, yet they cannot seem to go up in weight.The problem is almost always that they are eating too few calories. A great way to keep track is to use a free service called FitDay.You don’t have to keep counting calories forever, but if you do it for a few days, you will see how much you’re getting.If you want to gain weight, use this formula: 18 x (bodyweight in lbs). If you weigh 130 pounds, that means you should be getting at least 18 x 130 = 2340 calories on a daily basis.2. Lift Heavy ThingsIf you just eat more, you’ll get fat, and I hope that’s not your goal.One of the best ways to increase your weight gain is to lift weights. Yes, that includes women. Lifting weights is healthy and it helps you get a fit body.If you’re afraid of getting big muscles, don’t worry, you won’t.When you put pressure on your muscles – and your whole body – you will naturally become hungrier, and you will have a much easier time eating more food.3. Eliminate CardioOne of the best ways to gain weight fast is to sit on your ass all day, except for the times when you’re lifting weights.That’s not always practical, but you definitely do not want to add in any running or excess cardio, because it will only keep you from putting on more weight.You will get plenty winded from your weight training, so no worries on the health side.4. Eat BreakfastIt’s easy to skip breakfast. I remember when I weighed 20-30 pounds less. I skipped breakfast consistently, or I just had some toast with jam or something similar.Get your body used to eating something big for breakfast, such as eggs and bacon, an omelet with minced meat, or anything that packs calories.It may feel weird in the beginning because you’re not used to it, but your body will adapt, and so will you, because you will start feeling better almost immediately.5. Eat More OftenThis is a no-brainer, right? Eat more often and you shall gain lots o’ weight!It does sound simple, I agree, but most people don’t do it. The fact of the matter is that you have to stuff yourself if you want to gain weight fast.We skinny people are used to eating less and we have fast metabolisms, so we have to get our body used to weighing more and eating more.A simple way to do that is to eat every 2-3 hours.6. Eat NaturalAll of this does not mean you have the license to consume all the junk and processed food you want.Well, you could do that, but your health would suffer.What you want to do is stick to natural foods, such as grass-fed beef, organic chicken, wild fish and game, fruits, vegetables, yams, and sweet potatoes, just to name a few options.All that new weight is of no use if you aren’t healthy.7. Avoid the UnnaturalI’m talking about cookies, candy, ice cream, hamburgers, pizza, and the gang.Now, it’s okay to eat your favorite foods now and then. It’s not like you’re trying to lose weight, which is when you should be even more strict, so here and there is fine.I personally prefer pizza over candy. Pizza isn’t healthy, but sugar is even worse.8. Blend Your FoodOne of my favorite ways to get more calories is to simply blend a lot of stuff and chug it down.A simple smoothie you can make that is easily closing in on 1000 calories is:3 Bananas2 Scoops of Protein Powder (optional)BerriesPeanut butter2 Raw eggsCoconut milkAmazingly delicious and full of weight boosting calori...

how can i tell if someone has unfollowed me on facebook	if someone unfollows me does that affect chat order on facebook	0	I feel that yes when someone unfollows you on Facebook, they don't appear any longer on your side bar messenger list, nor do they appear first in mutual friends with others. It's like they are there but not really there. It's more like : Their hidden wish you unfollow them by example, but they are so messed up and don't know how to go about it without offending you, so they mess with what they have control of and they press the Unfollow button on you. Very sad. Unsubtle signs from subtle others ( you chuckle as you still want to call them friends but you can't in the virtual world) work on your friendship in the real world, if you care much about them.	"To understand the answer better let me explain you what kind of updates a user gets when they follow you. When someone follows you they get updated with your activity which is set to Public, if the user isn't in your friends list then they get very few updates like, if you've liked some pages, posts, commented on public pages, updated status ""set to Public"" these are the few things they get notified. If someone from your friend's list follows you, they get notified if you've new friends, if you've commented on your friend's posts, if you've liked someone's status, you almost get all the notifications except secure things which includes if you've sent messages, sent friend requests etc.If you want to stop your friends or other people to get notified with your activity then you just need to turn of the follow feature. I hope now you've understood a lot more than what you've asked. Finally it's not going to affect if someone has un-followed you."
are most blind people completely blind	are most blind people fully blind	1	Not really. For example, I am “legally blind” meaning that I have a corrected visual acuity of 20/200 in the better eye and a visual field of less than 20 degrees.I can read the computer screen, but I cannot see faces. I can walk with a cane, but I cannot drive. Total blindness is not as rare as all that, but it is not common either. Many blind and legally blind persons have some sight, such as the ability to see shapes and colors, but without enough clarity to read. Others might see clearly and sharply, but only a tiny pinhole of vision, so that they must read (if they can) one l___e___t___t___e___r______a___t______a______t___i___m___eand some can only see faint shadows of grey on black with only vague light perception.An explanation of the numbers here… 20/20 is normal vision. You can see, at 20 feet, what nearly everybody can at 20 feet. 20/200 means that what normally sighted persons can see at two hundred feet away, I must get up to twenty feet to see. You might br able to read a street sign at the end of the block, from the *other* end. I need to get up to the base of the pole the sign is on.There is also “prosopagnosia” or “Face blindness” I believe that it is caused by an injury to the brain *or* a blind infant passing the “window” of time in which they learn to recognize faces. As a newborn, I spent two months or more sealed in an incubator, with masked nurses caring for me. There is a neurological “learning window” of time in which an infant learns that two dots, a line and a curved line are a “face” :-D and they learn that faces represent people. Mommy’s face is not Daddy’s face. Sister’s face looks different than Granny’s face. I never got that. All faces were amorphous blurs, and the masks they wore prevented me from seeing more than just eyes. Fuzzily, at that. As a child, once I was able to talk, I consistently referred to EVERYONE as “mommy” because I had NO idea that there were *different* people. I thought I was seeing only one or two persons and that was all there was! It wasn’t until I got my glasses at age 3 or 4 that I realized that there were many many people! But they all had the same face. Sadly, to this day, I fail miserably at identifying celebrities. So there are as many differences in blindness, legal blindness and impaired vision, as you can imagine.	Not really.

what is the probability of an event certain to occur	is it true that the probability of an event occurring always is zero	0	There are a couple of ways to write probabilities. Frequently it’s a number ranging from 0 to 1, where 0 = can’t happen and 1 = certain to occur. Using this range is convenient for calculations.You can also write probabilities as percentages. 0% = can’t happen, 100% = certain to happen. These are harder to work with, but are more intuitive for most people.So a probability of 0.5 (expected to occur half of the time) is the same thing as 50% probability, as you would expect.	In this universe, apart for some contrived events, it's true... technically.In theory, it's false: it's easy to define an event that always occurs.Still, some events are so immensely likely that the probability that they happen might as well be 1. For example, throw a coin. What is the probability that it will land at all? That it will always land?I'd just give 1 for both and call it a day. You probably don't know mathematical notation that could express the infinitesimal slightness of the chance of the coin never landing.
how does someone knows they have social anxiety	how do i know if i have social anxiety	1	Social anxiety is one of the most common anxiety disorders. The statistics show that 13% of adults in USA have experienced social anxiety in their lives. It is a condition which often is mistaken with shyness but it actually goes beyond it. A person who suffers from social anxiety basically experiences fear when among other people and in situations of exposure. Often people with social anxiety fear that they will be embarrassed, they will do something that will be judged by others.Common SymptomsNervous stomachSweaty handsTremblingDry mouthPalpitationsShortness of breathHyperventilationWhen faced with the anxiety of the situation, some people will shut down and be very quiet while others will become very loud, outgoing and expressive. People with social anxiety disorder will take extreme measures to avoid or escape the triggering situations.Additionally, they may utilize a list of negative coping skills like use of alcohol and other drugs excessively to reduce symptoms.	Social Anxiety is the worst nightmare for any person having it.You get a phone call, you panic.Somebody knocks on the door, you panic.The teacher asks a question in class, you panic.The cashier asks you for card/money, you sweat.The waiter asks you for order, you panic.You talk to people other than your family/closest friends, your lips quiver.Visiting doctors, gives you chills.When you leave home, a mountain of discomfort and self-consciousness sits on your head.You do not like to go alone anywhere because all attention will be on you(you hate being the center of attention).You don’t like to eat in front of people or do anything which may cause others to look at you.You dress simple and put very little makeup so that people don’t stare at you.You are hesitant to ask people for help.When you are around people, you feel very self conscious about your dress, your look, your talking style, your walking style etc.At college, even though you may be very intelligent and hard working, your scores will go low just because of seminars and presentations.Your heart starts racing, hands and legs start shivering, lips start quivering, body starts sweating, you are unable to talk or breathe properly when you face a crowd whether or not you are expected to speak(The crowd can be as low as 5 people).You overthink each and every conversation(many times) and become depressed.The more you try to control your anxiety, the more it haunts you.You may be creative, logical, honest; your vocabulary may be excellent, your sense of humor may be fabulous, but when the time comes to talk, it looks as though you have very poor communication skills.You may not be able to make friends and may eventually be depressed.You may not talk much to your relatives, which will create distance.You may be very talented, but are afraid to show your talents.You may be a very loving and caring person, but fail to express your emotions.You might want to see a psychiatrist who might help you to overcome your social anxiety, but you don’t go to him because you have social anxiety(LOL!!)It becomes your biggest hurdle on the way of success, love, career, education etc :(You write this answer anonymously because people may judge you. And you read it many times before hitting submit.All these points may differ from person to person(and with different intensity). Every person having social anxiety may not experience the same above things but as a victim of social anxiety, I suffer from all these issues.
how did man bai jahangir  wife die	how did ti  daughter die when did it happen	0	Islam forbids Muslim women from marrying non-Muslims, but Muslim men may marry any woman who follows a Unitarian or monotheistic religion. Why...	Shortly after discovering she was expecting her second child with rapper T.I., former Xscape member Tameka ‘Tiny’ Cottle was faced with the heartbreaking news that her pregnancy check-up had raised a red flag.In a new interview with Essence.com, Tiny opens up about her pregnancy struggles, sharing that the sac that held her baby girl “was split in two and they had not combined by the time she had turned 16 weeks old.” With her daughter “positioned in the middle of those two sacs in her own sac,” Tiny was told to prepare for the “possibility that [the baby] could get tied up in her umbilical cord.”Despite the doctor’s warnings, according to Tiny, the thought of losing the baby never crossed her mind. In fact, says the singer, her doctors informed her that all was well with her baby, as things seemed to be under control. A trip to the specialist the following day however, proved otherwise. “When I went to see the specialist, that’s when they determined there was no heartbeat,” explains Tiny, who delivered her stillborn daughter six months into the pregnancy.Surrounded by family and friends to avoid her mind from wandering and being “so sad,” both Tiny — who found herself “very upset and depressed for awhile” — and T.I. spent the hours after the birth in the hospital room with their daughter Leyah Amore.For the devastated mother, the idea of leaving the hospital without her baby girl was understandably hard to swallow. “Here I am in the hospital to have a baby, deliver it, but I’m going to go home with no baby,” says Tiny, who admits she continues to “keep [Leyah’s] belongings near me — pictures and roses [from the burial].” While the songstress realizes that her form of grieving may seem “crazy” to others, she “just needed to be with” her baby girl.“After Leyah was born, I kept her in the room with me the whole day. They placed her in the little basket and we dressed her in an outfit and had a blanket wrapped around her. They came and got her because her body went cold and I wanted her back so they warmed her body again and I kept her. Everybody came to visit her and then me and [T.I.] had our time alone with her.”Continue reading for more on Leyah and the unexpected turn the couple’s relationship took.While the family held a “beautiful” funeral service for Leyah, Tiny admits she rarely visits the gravesite — apart from “holidays and special days” — as the memories leave her “too sad.” Despite the heartache and immense grief from the loss of their daughter, Tiny and T.I. found their greatest comfort in each other, eventually announcing their second engagement. Tiny — whose “experience taught me not to take life for granted” — shares that the tragedy surrounding their daughter “definitely brought us closer in our relationship.”In addition to Leyah, the couple are also parents to Clifford ‘King’ Harris III, 4, and Major Harris, 9 months. Tiny has daughter Zonnique Jailee, 12, while T.I. has Messiah, Domani, and Deyjah from previous relationships.
i need a biology ia individual investigation topic im desperate so can i have a topic and not tips	what are some interesting biology high school research topics	0	Rate of respiration in baker's yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) with different sugars (e.g. glucose, fructose, galactose, sucrose, lactose and maltose). You can do this by placing your reaction mixtures in syringes fitted with capillary tubes on the nozzle, and measuring the displacement of the mixture down into the tube.Alternatively, you can measure the time taken to decolourise methylene blue.	If you can learn to program or already know how to program, then you can try to do some “dry science” by writing some computer codes to analyze biological data. I suggest this because ultimately it only requires a computer and some data, so it significantly lowers the cost compared to doing a traditional bench experiment. You could try writing your own DNA alignment tool! (Maybe use this algorithm? Needleman–Wunsch algorithm - Wikipedia) You could try many other things, but I do think writing a DNA alignment tool is a good start.
i am an indian planning to go to us for ms a stem course this january if trump wins how will that affect my future in us	how is trump becoming the president affect the indians applying for an ms in america mech	1	I don’t talk about personal politics on public forums; instead, I will stick to facts as much as possible. In short, everything below I believe to be true, but not everything I believe is true is written below. (-:It’s far too early to know for sure exactly what the impact will be. As of this writing (mid-Nov 2016) we don’t even know who is going to be in key policy positions. Then, we don’t know how the Senate and House will react to their policy views. We don’t know how much party-line—crossing there will be; likely very little for the most part, but that is harder to predict if a policy is clearly prejudicial or damaging to the economy at large.Now, in terms of impact, there are personal impacts and job impacts.In terms of job impacts, it seems highly unlikely that anyone who is well-educated will do poorly in the short term. The US has tremendous economic opportunities for people who are skilled in high-value fields. Those companies are not going to fill their jobs out of nowhere. If the government starts to put in place policies that make it difficult to hire talented employees, companies will take those positions to where the employees are — abroad — creating exactly the opposite situation of what Trump promised when he ran. Of course, politics rarely follows along strictly rational lines of calculation, but ultimately it’s therefore important to separate bluster for the press versus what actually happens quietly in the background.Keep in mind, also, that if the job market does change by the time you graduate, unless the Revolution comes, you’re hardly the one who will be impacted. Anyone who is willing to pick up sticks, move half-way around the world, deal with differences in language and food and climate and a dozen other things, is likely going to have a place somewhere in the world. Getting a quality education can only help that.In terms of personal impacts, it might depend quite a bit on what you look like — in some locations. However, the vast majority especially of US research universities are not located in the places that are also appear to be the most prejudiced. Indeed, this election further widened the gap between urban and rural areas, and urban areas resoundingly voted for a more global perspective. A student at Brown doesn’t live in the USA as much as they live in Providence, a vibrant, multi-cultural town with numerous nationalities and races represented broadly. Inasmuch as you think the vote for Trump says anything, only about five states gave Clinton a higher percentage of vote (and not by much) than Rhode Island. So to someone who lived here, on a day-to-day basis, there would hardly be any perceptible difference in treatment. If anything, at this moment many people are especially sensitive and careful about how they treat others.It is also easy to forget how much progress has been made in the US.

what hotel in shimla hillstation would be safe for unmarried couples without the harassment of police hotel staff and moral police	what hotel in dehradun hillstation would be safe for unmarried couples without the harassment of police hotel staff and moral police	0	Book a room in advance in any of the 4/5 star hotel, you can even take a membership programs for weekend.Confirm the booking form the reservation team of the hotel. Book it on single occupancy.If you're booking it on double occupancy then straight away ask the question. (About your Gf stay)Check in in arrival date and request the front desk staff to see duty manager, ask duty manager that you have a guest visiting and you want to change the booking form single to double occupancy.When you're going uest/Gf arrives get herself checked in , you'll have to give the ID proof of her as well, (it's a mandatory process) pay for extra occupancy and go to your room and enjoy the time .Believe me the hotel staff doesn't have anything to do with your personal life.few of the international chains who are present in almost every metropolitan in India and also at all the tourist attractionsThis seems to be a biggest problem I have noticed,since I started using quora, Not only in Mumbai or Bangalore but all the places in India you will encounter same problem.Let's see One exampleAn unmarried couple go to a Hotel, Both have ID card they take a room and enjoy the time.Now they broke up, whatever is the reason.Following may be the result.1-Girl files a rape case on the boy.2-Boy have recorded the time spent together in his cellphone and puts it on net.3-Girl is a pro. And starts blackmailingIn all the cases hotel management will have to run around police though they are not at fault.Moreover due to security reasons all the hotels in metros such as Delhi Mumbai Bangalore etc remains on high alert (thanks to our neighbouring countries)& police can come and check the hotel(generally smaller or cheaper hotels, 5 star hotels have already a very tight security)If you have enough luggage with you and have proper prior reservation in a standard hotel. There are less chances that you are denied.I work in hotels and have seen unmarried couples in almost all the hotels ,even have seen many guest coming often but with a different partner every time(male/females both) If you are a legitimate guest in the eyes of hotel management then you will get the accommodation easily whether you are married or unmarried	Lets get started:-Chose Online: In the age of Internet everything has become the matter of few clicks. Here are few portals that can help you to chose the right place that fit into your budget, location, reviews, amenities etc.TripAdvisor:is one of the first & leading choice of millions of travelers. There is extensive list of not just hotels(budget to luxury) but also the restaurants, things to do and very vast & helpful community who make the TripAdvisor the number one choice to many travelers.Airbnb: If you want to stay with locals try Airbnb. It is a aggregator to the locals, who are willing to host their extra space for a little amount. You get your privacy like a hotel and feel like at home. Do not worry these locals are not like the typical Indian mind living in mugal era, they are very open minded and welcoming fellows. Just have a look at their mind blowing reviews by fellow travelers.OYO Rooms: I personally do not prefer OYO Rooms since i have not heard very astonishing reviews about it. But their broad geographical range make them on this list. One can easily find OYO Rooms board on many corners of many cities of India. Thanks to their aggressive marketing campaign. And they are at least 100 time better than the tradition guest houses.There are many other portals, you are free to chose your own. One might argue that even going through these portal might not assure the entry to unmarried couples. Yes, you are correct but answer is not finished yet.Contact the owners: Now once you are finished choosing the property contact the site owner directly either via email or phone and explained them your situation. It takes just couple of clicks to find their information to find on Google. Do not be shy, no one has time to judge you. It will take just 5 min to email them. 90% time they will reply you even if its a polite “No”. After all they are professional owners running their business through internet.just go ahead search, filter, read reviews and contact the owners and get your place booked before someone else do. Remember, It’s just a matter of few clicks.Some other portals for unmarried couples : -StayUncle:- Since the question is asked specifically about Dehradun so this website doesn't qualify. However Stay uncle is growing rapidly and has already been available to many cites in India so far. They are designed only for unmarried couples so one can expect every single single headache to be taken care by them such as police raids or going through any unnecessary embarrassment. Hope this option helps you in future when your GF graduates. :)StayZilla: StayZilla is an Indian version on Airbnb. What make it especial is that they have Search option for unmarried couples. They have many properties which host unmarried couples. All you need to do is just put the “Unmarried Couple” in the filters and there you go. And guess what, it is available in Dehradun too :)OYO for Unmarried Couples: Now even OYO Rooms welcomes to unmarried couples too. All you need to do is just turn this feature on. Ask Auto drivers:-Try this if you got no other option.I have been in the same situation and i found the a decent hotel with the help of an auto driver. My Gf is mexican, who looks almost Indian so there wasn’t a problem until they noticed her passport, which also looked Indian(navy blue cover). Unfortunately we were not allowed to stay due to different nationalities(I am Indian), which is still not clear to me why ? but the point is these auto drivers know the city better than anyone else. If you are willing to pay them a their little commission (I paid Rs100 more) which is usually paid by ugly hotels. they will show you the plethora of decent choices. Rest is up to you.Edit:Please do not forget to carry your valid ID proof.If you still can’t figure out just message me or comment. I’ll be more than happy to help you to search a decent place. Hope you enjoy and have a memorable fun
is world societies moving towards rational love contract	other than humans what are some examples of the smartest mammals	0	Love contracts are non institutional practices that are taking shape around USA, now. I am not sure whether that is prevalent anywhere else.I am not sure whether such marriages are rational, since rationality and ethics are all part of natural world, not of supenatural world of God centered life, where the values are spiritual love, belief, faith in each other, loving and living for each other, not asking any questions, not being suspicious, not being selfish and so on.In the contractual type marriages it is suspicion or lack of faith in each other that make them sign contracts before getting into any relationships. The presence of suspicion itself make it go out of the spiritual and institutional area to degenerate relationships even before the marriage has taken place. It is like politics taking precedence over love and care for each other from where health families form.So what goes on is probably something like political arrangements where for selfish reasons people come together and part also for the same reason, no rationality involved per se. Everything in the world nowadays happen not based on institutional values, but for politics and power based needs of individual and groups. So is this too.

is evolution real how has this been proven	what are the different ways in which evolution has been proven to be real	1	There are two definitions of “evolution” that we need to distinguish here, plus subsidiary concepts that are intimately related.One is “biological evolution”: that heritable traits exist in biological organisms, and that the distribution of these traits changes over generational time.This is an observed fact.Further to that, over considerable time (think of geological time scales), the changes that accrue can be considerable; the fossil record attests to this fact, as well as numerous other lines of independent evidence.Two is “mechanisms of biological evolution”: for instance, evolution by natural selection, genetics, proteomics, etc., which are all aspects of the “theory of evolution”.This is a framework of well-tested (implied: well-supported) hypotheses that explain observations relating to the first definition.The latter, together, and because they are well supported by evidence, is the theory of evolution. It is a model that explains what we objectively observe and predicts things we are yet to observe — in character and quality, if not always in precise detail.Because we don’t know everything perfectly — that is, because the theory of evolution is a model — its collection of hypotheses is always under varying degrees of refinement, though the core concepts are very well understood and very well fixed; it’s mainly at the edges of our knowledge that things may need to be refined. We cannot preclude that some new discovery will not shake the boat, but we can put reasonably long odds on such a an event.We can certainly rule out the rantings and ravings of professional young earth creationists: they are poison to science, to grounded religious faith, and to society, and I won’t entertain them further than necessary in this answer.Evolution the observed fact has been proven precisely because it has been objectively observed, and anyone with a wish to do so may take the definition of evolution-the-fact (not some distorted version that shifts the goalposts in some unscrupulous way — poison to the mind) and see that heritable changes occur and propagate on observable time scales. As with many things in science, you have to look closely and carefully — and clearly — which is why science is not always easy.Evolution-the-theory is “proven” in the sense that it has advanced through collective effort on the part of both impartial and hostile critics and accumulated evidence in support and survived tests that should have falsified it. Its core ideas are sound (based on the observed fact), and when wrong ideas about it have been proposed, they have, over time (and through the effort of rigorous investigation) been rejected (or more likely refined). Through the same effort it will continue to be refined.

Personal Favourite……. & No.1 ‘The' Half Girlfriend (2017)“Much more than a Headache ; Little less than a Suicide”Summary:- Half Girlfriend is very cleverly marketed as a story of Madhav, a Hindi speaking Bihari who falls in love with Riya, an elite Delhi girl at the prestigious St. Stephen’s College. It deceives you into believing that the story would revolve around the travails of a person who cannot speak English. However, it is a story about being horny for someone way above your league and then giving it the name of true love.The leading pair makes it to the esteemed college through the sports quota.The two bond over basketball and soon enough, the Bihari suggests games involving her basket and his balls. Riya, who isn't up for such shenanigans, forces on him an arrangement of half-girlfriendship, which is understood to be a relation more than friendship but excludes the physical-whisical. The Bihari male hormones soon get the better of Madhav, who professes his love with a: “Deti hai toh de, warna kat le.” Riya chooses the latter and kattofies, telling Madhav to never contact her again. Months pass before the Bihari boy can gather the courage to speak with her again, and when he does, Riya hands him her shaadi ka cardcomplete with chocolates and stuff.With Riya married off to a hotel-mogul in London, Madhav realizes that there isn't much to look forward to in Delhi. He therefore decides to go back to his village Dumraon to help his mother in running her rural school. But before he leaves, he sits for placements and makes the panel realize that the interviewers themselves are facing a mid-life crisis,then Madhav leaves for Bihar because it makes a good scene for a Bollywood movie- idealistic and shit.Mr. Jha, as we will now call him, starts helping his mother at her school, where they need funds to build toilets.As the government officials are unable to help in any way, the next obvious step is to get the founder of Microsoft to build our toilets.As luck would have it, Bill Gates decides to visit Bihar with his team from the Gates Foundation.Jha-Man soon enrolls himself for some English classes at Patna, the city where he also runs into Riya. ZOMG, how did this happen again! Totally did not see it coming!.Riya is now a divorcee and is working with Nestle. Madhav, with renewed hope of love, now helps her with setting up her little apartment, and in return, our lady helps him with his speech for Gates.Very close to the day of the big speech, Madhav takes Riya home to his mother, who gives our pretty lady the stares. The newly-in-love do some jumma chumma de de on the terrace.Immediately after the grand event, Riya memsa'ab goes missing. When Jha sa'ab goes around looking for his lady love, he receives a letter from Riya in which she tells him about her terminal lung cancer and how she has decided to go underground and die alone because she doesn't want him to take care of her in her last days.Jha-Boy looks for Riya-Babe all over but didn't get her.Through a journal which Madhav got from Riya's landlord from apartment where she resided, Madhav learns about the domestic violence his lady had to go through in her marriage, about how she was sexually abused as a child and about how Madhav’s mother had told her to stay away from him because of which she had to make up the cancer story and leave Mr. Jha to his own misery.(Wow, so much plot twist. *yawn*).Dr. Logic(Jha) remembers that Riya always spoke about wanting to be a singer at a bar in New York and therefore, she must be in New York. (Here, we accord him the title of Sherlock.) Mr. Holmes requests a few of his friends at the Gates Foundation to get him a three month internship in Manhattan. They oblige and Sherlock travels to the Big Apple in search of cray-cray. On his last night in America, he finds out where the crazy woman could be singing,runs like a hippy to reach he...
