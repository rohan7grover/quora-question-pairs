0,"I am going to ignore your question and share 5 proven steps to get started investing.Starting your first investment is a lot like climbing a mountain.You’re starting from ground zero with a lot of enthusiasm, but when you realize you have to climb for days to get anywhere, that enthusiasm often turns into the feeling of being overwhelmed.But when it comes to your investing career, the weather conditions, metaphorically speaking, are terrible as well.Hold on! You have made a smart move to invest in Equity, popularly called as shares. Indian GDP is growing at 6%-7% per annum and as thumb-rule equities deliver return which is equal to GDP growth + Inflation. Equities are best investment vehicle used as a hedge against inflation.Hey! getting started with your first investments is not terribly difficult - Here's what I would do to start my first investment and build up to $1000, $2000, $10,000………permonth in ""passive"" income.SEBI regulated a tight charge over documents submission. So this makes it a most crucial step. Your names, dates, and signature should be identical on all of your submitted docs.Below are the exact 4 basic documents that one need to get registered as a stock trader with SEBI.PAN cardIdentity proof (Aadhar card, driving license etc)Bank statement (last 6 month)Cancelled chequeThese are the basic documents. However, in some rare case, additional documents are needed. Consult the broker for the same.In addition, you would also have to fill up the registration form to which the above documents would be attached (highlighted in next step).But where do you submit the damn documents?This is what I’m going to show you in step 2.Not only brokers help you to get your documents verified with SEBI, they also facilitate live trading in stock market. You can buy and sell stocks with just one call or one click (on trading app, platforms)What you’ve to do is contact a broker and deliver them registration form with above-attached documents.But still one should choose a broker with great attention. Some brokers charge so high that most of your profit is swallowed by their charges. An uncle of mine generated a brokerage of 1.5 lakh in 2 months on F&O trading. I was baffled after seeing his charge-sheet.When was the last time you read an investing book or an economic magazine article? Do your daily reading habits center around hot tips tweets, Facebook updates, or the directions on moneycontrol website? If you’re one of the countless people who doesn't make a habit of reading books and articles regularly, you might be missing out: reading has a significant number of benefits on your investments and your market behavior.Step away from your computer stock screen for a little while, crack open a book, and replenish your soul for a little while.Below are 3 books which are highly recommended to beginners.Stocks to Riches: Insights on Investor Behavior (by Parag Parikh)My personal opinion: At my earlier days, I started reading highly suggested books but didn’t benefit more than this book. In my opinion, this book is a key to understanding other books. Just an extremely insightful book of great practical value that every investor, both beginners and the experienced, should read. No more words.Rich Dad Poor Dad (by Robert T. Kiyosaki)My personal opinion: This is my all time favorite. This book has also qualified for the Amazon Best Reads List – June’16. This book what made me understand the crux of value investing and spread a great message of how money makes money.The Little Book That Still Beats the Market (by Joel Greenblatt)Side Note: Still I’m finding this book to read. Also tried to buy this book on Amazon but not in stock. Contact me personally if you can endorse this book to me. I read summary and reviews of others on this book and find it interesting.

1,"History of Kohinoor DiamondThe Kohinoor is one of the oldest and most famous diamonds in the world. The history of the Kohinoor goes back in history to more than 5000 years ago. The current name of the diamond, Koh-i-noor is in Persian and means “Mountain of Light”. Below you will find a timeline of this priceless diamond.Up to 1500It is believed that the diamond was first mentioned more than 5000 years ago in a Sanskrit script, where it was called the Syamantaka.SyamantakaIt is worth mentioning that there is only speculation that the Syamantaka and the Kohinoor are the same diamond. After this first written mention, for over 4,000 years the diamond is not mentioned.Maharajah Ranjit SinghUp until 1304 the diamond was in the possession of the Rajas of Malwa, but back then, the diamond was still not named Kohinoor. In 1304, it belonged to the Emperor of Delhi, Allaudin Khilji.In 1339, the diamond was taken back to the city of Samarkand, where it stayed for almost 300 years. In 1306 in a Hindi writing, a curse is placed on the men who will wear the diamond: “He who owns this diamond will own the world, but will also know all its misfortunes. Only God, or a woman, can wear it with impunity.”BaburBaburIn 1526 the Mogul ruler Babur mentions the diamond in his writings, Baburmama.The diamond was gifted to him by the Sultan Ibrahim Lodi.He was the one who described the diamond’s value equal to half-day production costs of the world.One of the descendants of Babur, Aurangzeb , protected the diamond diligently and passed it on to his heirs.Mahamad, the grandson of Aurangzeb, however, was not a fear-inspiring and great ruler like his grandfather.Nadir and MahamadNadir ShahThe Persian general Nadir Shah went to India in 1739. He wanted to conquer the throne, which had been weakened during the reign of Sultan Mahamad. The Sultan lost the decisive battle and had to surrender to Nadir.It was him the one that gave the diamond its current name, Koh-i-noor meaning “Mountain of light”.But Nadir Shah did not live for long, because in 1747 he was assassinated and the diamond got to one of his generals, Ahmad Shah Durrani.A descendant of Ahmad Shah, Shah Shuja Durrani brought the Koh-i-noor back to India in 1813 and gave it to Ranjit Singh (the founder of the Sikh Empire). In exchange Ranjit Singh helped Shah Shuja get back the throne of Afghanistan.British East India CompanyIn 1849, after the conquest of the Punjab by the British forces, the properties of the Sikh Empire were confiscated.The Koh-i-noor was transferred to the treasury of the British East India Company in Lahore.The properties of the Sikh Empire were taken as war compensations. Even one line of the Treaty of Lahore was dedicated to the fate of the Koh-i-Noor.The diamond was shipped to Britain on a ship where cholera broke out and supposedly the keeper of the diamond lost it for some days and it was returned to him by his servant.The diamond was handed to Queen Victoria in July 1850.Queen VictoriaKohinoor diamond in Queen-s Victoria broochWhen Nadir Shah heard of the diamond, he decided he wants it in his possession.After the diamond was handed to Queen Victoria, it was exhibited at the Crystal Palace a year later. But the “Mountain of Light” was not shiny as the other cut gemstones of that era and there was a general disappointment regarding it.In 1852 the Queen decided to reshape the diamond and it was taken to a Dutch jeweler, Mr Cantor who cut it to 108.93 carats.Queen Victoria wore the diamond occasionally afterwards. She left in her will that the Koh-i-noor should only be worn by a female queen.If the head of state was a man, his wife would have to carry the diamond. After Queen Victoria’s death, the Kohinoor became part of the Crown Jewels."

3,"While reading your question I pictured myself at your age. Psychologically, it’s soothing when you find another person with similar experience and generally ( 90% cases ) this makes you feel an invisible connection with that person.First of all ,I don’t want to take this line - “none of my friends is on my level of intelligence” as a fact, because Intelligence is something very complicated to describe. The human brain is as complex as the universe. And, you can’t just measure the intelligence of a person with some special ability he possesses while others don’t. In this regard, you can read Dylan James's answer to What are the most annoying types of questions on Quora?Now, for the sake of argument, let's say, you have a very high IQ score, which is the evidence of your high intelligence. Now, why are you bothered with the part “you are better in intelligence than anyone or you are lower than anyone or you are unique and different from others”? You should just focus on your action. Try to use your intelligence in your thoughts and actions. Otherwise, what is the value of your Intelligence? If you’re in different level to communicate with mass people and don’t even feel the necessity to join their daily chit-chat; don’t regret it. It’s quite alright! But, if you desperately want to connect to people with different interests, then try to act in a wise way so that they can easily interact with your [1] .Secondly , at your age I would like to formulate on Tesseracts geometry , closed universe model equations , String Theory , Parallel Universes , Inflationary Cosmology , Quantum Mechanics , Metaphysics and the unsolved problems of Number Theory . My world was just with the physics books which were lent from libraries , loads of mathematical Olympiad books , chess board , Sudoku , Rubik's Cube , pencils ,fresh and torn paper ( In those days ( 2005–2008) internet was out of my reach or I didn’t have the luxury to use it ) . In general ( 90% cases ) I found people of my age were somehow so average that they always tried/did those things which were instructed by the society/tradition/religion/friend-circle/family …. . I tried to analyse why they do what they do ? Why I do What I do ? Why is the differences ? How the difference have been created ? Is it evolutionary ? I did the analysis of almost everything in my head . That made me a secluded person . Its evolutionary that average people are afraid of unknown which ultimately brings fear to connect with different vibes . I found people around me performed their sacred duties to do what they were told to do or they were supposed to do or they had to align with the mass-people's vibe. It was their definition of life to live and that doesn’t prove they aren’t intelligent enough to resonate with me :)The most ridiculous thing once I discussed (foolishly/accidentally/daringly) with our physics professor (in private environment) that I had found some flaws in the special theory of relativity and I had a way to show it. Then somehow the news had spread in my college and I found a number of people with similar tastes, interests and thought process. They would like to accept my challenges. They offered me to have a debate with them on a reasonable ground. After that incident, we were found discussing , arguing about the topics in anywhere , anytime with anyone ( we got some active audiences too ) … That was the first time, I felt that I’m alive. I discovered myself as an analytical person and the only thing I love is the reason , argument and discussions.I even carried out my secret model theory of the infinite universe in a piece of torn paper to show it to whoever feels interested in my vibe. The end part was I found no one for the next three years and when I found at least someone to show my thoughts, I was no more interested in those childish theory/act of my earlier life. By that time, I was completely a different person outside trying to adapt another spectrum of people and environment to keep me alive other than being mentally dead or secluded.Well, in college, I had a narrow circle. But, when I went to university, I found a wide band of people with different spectrum and so called top most intelligent and meritorious people of our country.A large number of them was intelligent but not cognitive or intellectual in thought or taste according to my primary test . Well, intelligent people are sometimes intellectual ( when a computer scientist has made an A.I with considering the facts other than just a narrow view of people / world ) but , sometimes intelligent people are not intelligent enough to be analytic/ cognitive to the broader aspect of society or people ( For example , When , an engineer deliberately helps a terrorist to build bomb because his only passion or love is to create bomb but which purpose it has been used doesn’t matter until it interferes with his narrow circle of life ) .Thirdly , I have seen people in my life who are too much practical , less analytical outside the topics of their focus and always busy in building some particular thing . They are actually engineers who finally happened to be realist and less theoretical . Some are too much social and activists . I found one friend among them . I can’t get himself in philosophical or metaphysical discussion in deep level to understand or to resonate . I can’t dance with his vibe and he can’t dance with mine. His talk was deep with others only when he was on his project discussions or his field research . I found the problem of seclusion involves being not practical / more philosophical less practical / 100% philosophical or metaphysical in general ( most cases ) .Fourthly, you want to share with someone physically . Does that mean you try to emphasis more on emotional or hormonal significance of sharing than the fact you ‘re just interacting with someone who understands and care to understand you ? Well , maybe the people around you or the environment doesn’t suit you . So, you physically can’t get someone near you . I think travelling can help you to solve about physical part of the problem .Join Book clubs . Take part in discussions . Listen , what others have to say . Question them , question your views . Express your views … Well, that’s a start :)I assure you , in this way you may found a lot more intelligent people for communication , who happen to be on different level of intelligence to connect with you ( according to your view/ survey / estimation) .[1] Actually , its the era of internet . So , you don’t want to bother about the fact being mentally lonely . Do you?You will found a lots of amazing people in Quora ( yes, specially in Quora ) , Reddit (product) , Disqus with similar interest to talk or discuss . If you are even shy to do that then try to practice writing your idea or thoughts in comment sections . You can try it in Facebook (product) also .Start your own website or blog . Try to open your view in anything you are interested . Maybe , some people of different interest found your thought/ writing interesting enough to study the topics to just talk with you ; to make reason or argue with you . That may be interesting to you . Isn’t it? You may even found some people with similar tastes to interact .If writing on internet blog is too much hard for you then start keeping personal diary or notes . Once you start to write , you will find words to express everything inside and outside around you .You can work on your own project and write journal by using internet only . Attend open lectures , seminars of professors , question them . Get help from teachers.Read blogs of people that interests you . Take active participation in comment sectionRead a lot . Use Goodreads to write reviews . Take part in book discussions. Read books of all kinds ( not only which interests you most) . Listen to other peoples thoughts . Make analysis and publish them .Download published journal papers on your interested topics. Read the prior work , current work on that topics. Make questions and mail the author about your questions and ideas about his work . Find out experts people/ professors on your interested field in the internet . Then try to make a conversation with them about the work.Another , smart way to be social and to bring friends in your metaphysical world can be done by working with tactics. At first , try to listen people around you . Categorizes themselves on a scale of similarity 0 to 10 . Take the top most people on your little experiment . Socialize with them in a common way , try to understand and analyze them . Then , slowly use your amazing philosophical conversation to dance with them . Be adaptive a little and compromise with them for greater benefit of your own . In this way you are opening the gate between your world and their world . As you are the maker of the whole idea so the key point of winning to bring themselves in your world through the gate is in your hand . After that , decorate your world to amaze them . Because , when you have friend who care to listen what you say then you can open up to them . This may liquefy your loneliness :)If you are a logical person you may know that someone with similar interests will not always miraculously ( incident with comparatively low probability is the scientific term for miracle/ luck/ bad luck ) come to talk with you .You have to express yourself about what you do or want to do ,not to impress someone ;but to define who you really are !Isn’t it ? :)"

5,"You are a monster of ambition, even if you do not show it outwardly. Your desire to better yourself and achieve something tangible, lasting in life is almost certainly very strong indeed. You definitely “play the long game”, taking one step at a time, until your goals are reached; you don’t mind if it doesn’t happen overnight… it will take decades, and you are cool with that. The goals you have are slow, but steady; you are more the tortoise than the hare. You almost surely agree with the statement: “I’m a firm believer in luck; and the harder I work, the more luck I find that I have.” You have a realistic idea of how the world works, and you will trust what people DO long before you will trust what people SAY. You probably are sparing with words, but long on action. You probably are quite modest and seemingly unassuming… even when you are a success, you do not over-aggrandize yourself. You probably have a superb, dry sense of humor. You like art, music and architecture which has withstood the passage of time, taking a dim view of new fads which are merely “flashes in the pan”. You love what lasts, what endures. You probably dress conservatively, and often do not need to be the center of attention; you know that visibility— and sterling reputation— can be two very different things. You probably love the outdoors, and may be a superb fisherman, camper, explorer, naturalist, gardener, landscaper or carpenter, and your home is almost surely filled with interesting things you’ve made by hand, and souvenirs of fascinating places you’ve visited. You love animals very much and almost certainly own a dog. You do not mind rolling your sleeves up, perspiring and getting dirty. You are a great “McGyver”, and know how to improvise and make do with limited resources. You love to help people when they need it the most. You may have a taste for some choice, expensive things— such as car or clothing or jewelry—- yet for the most part you are not especially consumed with a need for flashy luxury. You may have a traditional religion, because you like things that have very old reputations and philosophies. When you visit a new city, it will be the very old, historical sites that attract you the most.Basically, in this life, your soul had the purpose of richly living in the real, concrete world and respecting things that are sturdy, reliable and natural. And people who are, too. You prefer to let others pontificate and philosophize and write about life; you’re too busy living it."

TATA cars not very pleasant looking and thus with better performance, a better design should be a important feature in their upcoming cars.Tata Tiago XZ - price is 5.5 lakh ( ex-showroom )will compete withHyundai i10 - price around 4.95 lakhsMaruti Celerio - price around 4.65 lakhsThough Hyundai and Maruti are brands which deserve a praise from Indian Customers, Tiago should be a hit in its segment.ExteriorWith a sporty look, Tiago XZ features sporty 3-dimensional headlamps, body-coloured ORVMs and door handles, chrome garnish on fog lamps, and alloy wheels. The car is styled very sharply and the three-dimensional Tata Motors marquee is hosted in a very classy manner. The car gets great aerodynamics, sharp lines and smooth curves, which gives it a confident and powerful stance.InteriorTata Tiago interiors feature dual tone interior scheme, full fabric upholstery, premium finish and plastics around the cabin. The chrome finishes on the air vents further accentuate the looks inside. The seats are very well cushioned. And like all other Tata cars, Tiago has an ample of Space inside !PerformanceTata Tiago Petrol XZ specifications include a 1.05-litre engine with a 5-speed manual transmission. The engine offers a power output of 69 bhp at 400 rpm. The maximum torque produced by the Tiago is 140 Nm, which is delivered between 1800 – 3000rpm.The major setback for the car is the fact that both Maruti Celerio and Hyundai i10 are offered with an automatic transmission :(And for the customers asking the questions“ kitna deti he ? “The company has given assurance of 23kmpl. Which is pretty decent to compete with others in the segment.This variant of Tiago is offered with ABS and EBD, driver and passenger airbags, and a vehicle stability control system.The Follow-Me Home headlamps and Anti-theft device further add to the safety features of the car.With the tilt adjustable power steering, the handling of the car is quite decent"
7,"This is one of the nicest questions I’ve seen!Well, here’s some pointers to what makes a difference in what is one of the most extraordinary and fundamental professions…..Humility. The Earth is greater than all of us. Up until now it has provided the basis of our everything. And equally it can take it all away in a flash.The ability to imagine. What you see now in our world is not necessarily what has come before and the Earth System has a track record that goes back 4.6 billion years…..but has only preserved a portion of its tale. The rest we have to infer.Ability to handle uncertainty. Unless you can pick up something in your hand and sample it, then you’ll always be relying on stand-off (second-hand) analysis of what it is. Often, you will be sampling no more than a trillionth of the bigger picture.Synthesis. You will pull from a myriad of sources of information from the nanometric to the galactic. And you may voyage through this universe in a single day.Grace. You will tap into all the other grand sciences which peer down at you, but you will have a wry smile to yourself that without you no-one would understand Home.Passion. How can you not be excited by the Earth? This is a subject you never need to switch off from and keeps giving for as long as you ask questions.A Story-Teller. You are suspicious of dogma for you know that too much is unknown, but there is still much meaning to be gleaned from careful and fair observation.Patience. You will never likely have all the facts. But you are adding to a Great Story.A capacity to never stop learning. Your “office” will be the grandest thing you’re ever likely to encounter and you will only ever discover a proportion of what there is to know about it.I therefore tend to believe that a Good Geologist has many of the qualities of a Good Human Being."

10,"The Fresnel's Biprism Experiment setup illustrates the phenomenon of interference of light.In this experiment, we are much interested in calculating the wavelength of given monochromatic light.White light is a combination of lights of different wavelength in electromagnetic spectrum. Electromagnetic radiation with a wavelength between 380nm and 760nm. This is the case with white light.While, the Sodium light that we use has only two wavelength 589.0nm and 589.6nm.This is the case with sodium light.Therefore we use sodium light so that we can get fine line of different wavelength(2 lines for sodium light) while white light contains a range of wavelengths so fine lines are not possible.Note : image used are for illustration purpose only.

12,"You need to see the application of physics around yourself to create interest in physics.Eg) Say you are driving and there is a sharp corner where negotiating speed limit is stated. Your study of physics will help you understand how this speed limit is arrived at. You see a bridge with a maximum weight limit stated.Physics will help you to understand how this maximum number was arrived at. So to develop interest, try to find how things happening in your surrounding are related to physics principles. Physics is not a hard subject to master or understand. It mostly involves application of rules, such as Ohm’s law for electricity for electrical circuits or to measure current when you know component resistance and voltage applied, or newtons laws for motions to find distance traveled or speed after certain time, etc. One way you can improve your knowledge and interest is to read Physics books written by different authors. This will make it easier to understand the concepts. I used to be in your situation and improved when I did what I have stated herein.Hope I helped :)"
13,"Definitely a memorable experience :-) I had to take permission of the guy before writing this, and he told me that I can only write it when we both are together. So here is how it went-He was my first boyfriend, a guy from school who managed to woo me during Junior College (Class 11th). We were teenagers when we started dating, and it was quite normal to be curious. So our late night phone conversations tended to get quite naughty. But we had to wait until after Junior College for it to happen for the first time.His parents had gone away for a week, and so we had finally made our plans. He somehow got the condoms procured. I had a good session at the beauty parlour the day before.I arrived at his place in the afternoon, wearing a spaghetti purple crop top, denim jeans and jacket and he was kind of already excited when I rang his doorbell (Could make out from what I saw in his shorts).We went to his bedroom making sure we had locked both, the main door and his bedroom door. He made me sit beside him on the bed and locked his lips onto mine. After a good, long, passionate kiss, he took my jacket off and began kissing and licking my sensitive neck and ears from behind. That was the point where I knew I wasn't going to be able to resist that day.He then helped me out of my jacket and after making me lie down, began to kiss my hands and teased the bare skin of my belly with a finger for sometime before getting me out of my spaghetti top. I remembered the look on his face when he first saw my breasts- like the way a kid looks on for a candy. After some passionate lovemaking to my breasts, he slid my jeans and panties down and proceeded to tease my clit with his tongue, making sure I had a couple of orgasms already before he decided to penetrate me. When he first went in, I felt a sharp stab of pain, which slowly subsided even as he could no longer resist thrusting hard till he finally collapsed.After laying beside each other for sometime, he carried me in his arms to the shower and helped me wash. And we had some light dinner, and then cuddled into each other in bed as we went into a dreamy sleep.So yeah, quite a good first sex experience. We dated for a couple of years after that, but had to split, though we still remain good friends. He's with me right now, as he helped me write this answer and we're alone. Good night readers. :D"
14,"Simply, you can’t.There is no direct route from student to green card - your student visa entitles you to study in the USA, then after you must return to your home country.To transition (eventually) to a green card, you first have to find a employer who will sponsor you for an employment visa (H1B for example), and then you have to be lucky enough to be selected for one (many more people apply than receive).After a few years working in the USA, you may then become eligible to transition to a permanent resident - but again, most employment visas are not “dual intent” - they only allow someone to work in the USA for a number of years, before again, going home. The H1B is one of these.Everything you need to know about US Visas is available on the department of state website - Employment-Based Immigrant Visas"
15,"I don’t talk about personal politics on public forums; instead, I will stick to facts as much as possible. In short, everything below I believe to be true, but not everything I believe is true is written below. (-:It’s far too early to know for sure exactly what the impact will be. As of this writing (mid-Nov 2016) we don’t even know who is going to be in key policy positions. Then, we don’t know how the Senate and House will react to their policy views. We don’t know how much party-line—crossing there will be; likely very little for the most part, but that is harder to predict if a policy is clearly prejudicial or damaging to the economy at large.Now, in terms of impact, there are personal impacts and job impacts.In terms of job impacts, it seems highly unlikely that anyone who is well-educated will do poorly in the short term. The US has tremendous economic opportunities for people who are skilled in high-value fields. Those companies are not going to fill their jobs out of nowhere. If the government starts to put in place policies that make it difficult to hire talented employees, companies will take those positions to where the employees are — abroad — creating exactly the opposite situation of what Trump promised when he ran. Of course, politics rarely follows along strictly rational lines of calculation, but ultimately it’s therefore important to separate bluster for the press versus what actually happens quietly in the background.Keep in mind, also, that if the job market does change by the time you graduate, unless the Revolution comes, you’re hardly the one who will be impacted. Anyone who is willing to pick up sticks, move half-way around the world, deal with differences in language and food and climate and a dozen other things, is likely going to have a place somewhere in the world. Getting a quality education can only help that.In terms of personal impacts, it might depend quite a bit on what you look like — in some locations. However, the vast majority especially of US research universities are not located in the places that are also appear to be the most prejudiced. Indeed, this election further widened the gap between urban and rural areas, and urban areas resoundingly voted for a more global perspective. A student at Brown doesn’t live in the USA as much as they live in Providence, a vibrant, multi-cultural town with numerous nationalities and races represented broadly. Inasmuch as you think the vote for Trump says anything, only about five states gave Clinton a higher percentage of vote (and not by much) than Rhode Island. So to someone who lived here, on a day-to-day basis, there would hardly be any perceptible difference in treatment. If anything, at this moment many people are especially sensitive and careful about how they treat others.It is also easy to forget how much progress has been made in the US. People reading about the election from a distance, getting news dominated by Trump, might be surprised to hear that in this election season, the US has voted in [list courtesy Brighten Godfrey]:Stephanie Murphy (FL) — first Vietnamese-American woman elected to CongressCatherine Cortez Masto (NM) — first Latina elected to U.S. SenatePramila Jayapal (WA) — first person of South Asian descent elected to House of RepresentativesKamala Harris (CA) — first person of South Asian descent elected to U.S. SenateIlhan Omar (MN) — first Somali-American legislator (she was elected to the state house of representatives)Kate Brown (OR) — first openly LGBTQ governorTammy Duckworth (IL) — first female senator that has seen combat, and second Asian-American female senatorSamuel Park (GA) — first openly gay man in the Georgia legislatureand so on. I bet those stories were not covered in the international press. Note that Ilhan Omar is openly Muslim, and even wears a hijab. There are many Muslim countries where she could not even stand for election.Finally, just remember that eight years ago the USA voted in its first black president. Things go in cycles. History is long, and bears reading.Personally, I’m pretty confident I could mail out my resume to a bunch of different countries and get pretty positive responses. (When something happens in the US, I get notification from foreign friends of job postings at their university….) Let’s just say I haven’t dusted off my vita at all. In time, I think most things heal themselves. In the meanwhile, I’m committed to doing what I can to improve the education of students and state of knowledge—the very same things I was committed to the day before the election."

Its literal, concrete, real-world meaning is moving something with your hand, like manipulating the controls of a game console handset.Its figurative, metaphorical meaning is to control people or events, especially in a secret or underhanded way.

People always believe of themselves to be good, honorable and just. So even when they do something incomprehensible or nigh ugly, they will do their best to satisfy their own conscience. Telling a guy “we can just be friends” falls in this category. From their perspective they did the right thing (if you hurt, too bad!). If you reciprocate the friendship then (always from their perspective) they did the right thing if you do not (always from their perspective) then you a) never wanted to really be their friend or you were not a good friend anyway (so they are right to reject you). As you can see a woman’s conscience seems to be sparkly clean either way."
18,"No. These questions are encouraged as they fit into our mission to share and grow the world's knowledge.Here's some more of our rationale behind this policy. I'll call questions to which the answer can be found easily via a search engine ""easy questions"".When someone has a question, they often don't know whether it's an easy question or not without doing a search. We wouldn't want everyone to have to preemptively search Google before posting a question on Quora.Even if that individual person might have been better off using a search engine for that question than asking on Quora in the short run, their question adds to the collection, and once we get a good answer to it, anyone who has that question in the future will be able to get straight to that. Additionally, the question will be browsable in whatever topics it's added to, it will show up in related questions, and others will be able to reference it from their own answers to different questions.Often the ideal answer we can provide for an easy question is better than what could be quickly found via a search engine. The answer could come from an expert who is well known to be authoritative on the subject, it could explain the reasons why the answer is correct, and it could give a reader more confidence in the answer than a search engine result page.There are a smaller number of easy questions than hard questions, and we should be able to tackle most of them and accumulate a set of great answers to them, so the ongoing burden on the community of answering easy questions should be limited.Easy questions are often the way someone new to Quora will test out the system. Getting a response like ""go Google it"" or getting ignored will turn them away and make Quora less valuable for everyone.The one exception to this is easy questions that are not reusable. We wouldn't want to have every possible sum of three digit numbers like ""what is 432+458"" and ""what is 432+459"" and ""what is 432+460"", etc., in the system. But it would be fine for us to have ""what is the capital of X"" for every country X, since those questions are useful to others."

If you are actually asking about kV, you would have to answer the question: At what amperage?(A volt is a unit of electrical potential.

24,"I have the same experience since 2012, it does not go away, whenever I check the time to know the time, it is the same numbers, 1:11, 2:22, 3:33, 5:55, 4:44 and …I made a screen shot of each time I check the time, 90% of the time, it is weirdly the same numbers, based on probability it is very unlikely. even when I am sleep, if I get a text and I open my cellphone to read it, when I look at the time it is the same numbers!I decided not to think about it for months, because I thought it makes me crazy, but I still see it every day.Yesterday I was in target store, when the cashier showed me the money on her screen, it was $41.41, I laughed and told her cool, the same numbers, then I checked my cellphone, it was 10:10 pm. I got shocked, it was just like it does not want me to forget it.Again, I got curious about it, can this odd probability be only a coincidence? is it really possible to have the same numbers every day for years!? Today I was looking at the first text I have ever sent to the girl I loved, it was at 10:10 pm! I could not believe it. it is just the most important moments are signed with these numbers in my life.Then I realized something else, I realized that I was born in 1/11/1977The same numbers.This numbers, whatever they are, can not be just a coincidence, it can not be a chorono biological clock either, because 10:10 and 11:11 has no mathematical pattern.I wish there was an answer for this.I am not a man of metaphysics, and it is really bothers me to see that these numbers happen in my life over and over again. There is no message in them, at least I can not interpret any message. Maybe they are some marks in my life, maybe they mean that this life is not real, because if it was, it could not be full of repeated numbers!My girlfriend made a collection of all the screen shots and sent it to me, at least it proves that I am not having illusion.If you have the same experience and have an idea to make any sense of this, please share it with me.Bobbyusb@Yahoo.comThank you:-)Bobby"

27,"I don't think there's a 'simple answer' or that this question is a simple dichotomy.  I find most simple answers and most basic debates can be boiled down to 'in my opinion/experience'.  That's not a problem, unless we are going to build policy on it and in sport, much of the funding/priority we see through both public projects (school sport and such) and private sponsorship is based on these saccharine sweet, rhetorical stories about the ""power of sport"".  It is at this point where the temptation to cite innumerable personal examples of the positive or negative impact of sport, but please hold those thoughts for a minute.My understanding after being involved in amateur and professional sport as a player, administrator, in governance and even as an owner as well as examining the research on numerous specific 'power of sport' interventions across the US and parts of Europe is that sport is indeed disproportionately powerful, a classic example of a privileged entity that over promises and under-delivers, except for an elite few - and has done this for decades.  Sport is the ultimate venture capital pyramid - big, wide-ranging investment with a tiny proportion of people reaping any rewards at all and 'collateral damage' as a necessary by-product.  In the scheme of the current US election rhetoric, I know this is an automatically divisive idea, but I think the parallel holds some water.'Sport' makes the kind of bold, unregulated promises of return on investment that Lehman's and Fannie May made in the late-1990's and it is only a great, communal fondness for the products of sport, their poignance as a cultural meme and the select positive memories of (and benefits for) a powerful few - not to mention some slickly produced events and well manicured messaging around sport that keeps the realisation of the artificial inflation of the importance of sport, from coming to the front of our minds.  It's a bubble that is more resilient than the housing market, but an alternate reality bubble non-the-less.  Sometimes it's easier to believe this suspension of reality that allows coaches, athletes and administrators of sport who lack any real vision to be so powerful, is somehow 'the way it should be' rather than critically question the role of sport in society.  Sadly, the hero-worship of people without vision only serves to blind huge swathes of society, so I can't endorse it.I have just returned from the SportAccord and International Olympic Committee (IOC) Conference in Québec and despite the obviously necessary nuance around this question, there is something clearly askew with the priority - and in some cases primacy - of sport in society that is demonstrated by the deeply privileged, self-congratualtory, cognitive dissonance that described many of the most powerful people there.  People who rejected the idea of their own disproportionate privilege even as they sat drinking champagne with royalty on the basis of their position in sport alone.  They also reject the idea that putting a ball in a hole is indeed not that important in the scheme of most families, never mind society at large, but I did that for 20 years and both my experience, and the pervasive research seem to back the idea that we all may be backing the wrong horse here.Before you think otherwise, I do believe we can do amazing things with sport (or art or maths or dance - you get the idea...)  I have community centre with 2700 kids a week going through its doors - but it works holistically, working with - and to produce - well-rounded young people, not young athletes. In order for my centre to work, I had to put away my precious ideas about some sports (basketball) being great at teaching 'life-lessons' and others not so much and realised that sport is an empty vessel (at best) and what we fill it with makes the difference (positive or otherwise).  Sadly, much of sport and those who govern and 'teach' it are anti-intellectual, emotionally illiterate, blinkered by raw machismo, institutionally racist, homophobic and misogynist and as such, what they teach and the type of person produced at the end of that experience, is exactly the kind of person who lacerates his shooting hand on a fire hydrant case when he gets frustrated at a game, not to mention the kind of people who's lives disintegrate into relationship breakdown, under-employment and alcoholism once their 'glory days' are over - especially when those glory days end in junior high.There are some great people doing great things through sport, but frankly they are the magic element and if they taught French or Zumba, the participants might be demographically different, but the impact would likely be similar.  My critique is NOT of these people using sport to do good, but rather the lack of public analysis of the appropriate role of sport and insisting that those who administer and coach, do so in a way that produces the outcomes we are so boldly promised.Much of the inordinate primacy of sport is based on a pervasive, anecdotal,  understanding (at least amongst those in power) that sport is always and necessarily a 'powerful teacher of valuable, positive tangential lessons' ('respect', 'teamwork', 'motivation', etc.)  Sadly, the science on these impacts is what good scientists call ""equivocal at best.""  I am tired of the rhetoric of those who believe that sport is, in of itself, somehow magic - that it can make fat children thin, sad children happy, indolent children active and whole communities 'come together', when the truth is, sport does exactly what we make it do, and for the most part with don't demand it does much more than occupy the time of our young people between 3pm and 7; allow men to live vicariously through their children or indeed other men and then entertain us once or twice a week and every four years so long as we make the pact to not ask too many questions or scrutinise it too hard.I don't reject the potential value of sport to society, indeed I embrace it, as I know so many do in the pockets of good practice across the world, but these few pockets do not mitigate the damage done by the unrestrained, unfocused, 'old-fashioned' sport delivered to unwitting participants in schools, community centres and weekend leagues across the world.  There seems to be a sad and dangerous parallel between it's unfettered and unquestioned role in society and those of other institutions that promise much to many and deliver little - sometimes nothing - to most, except those privileged few.And in case you're wondering, there is a solution: we need to increase the abilities of those governing and coaching sport to deliver the tangential psycho-social impacts we have been promised for decades.  These men (and they are mostly men) don't need to become therapists, but they do need to be able to understand that their charges are people first and athletes second, they need to be able to respond appropriately to a crying boy (""Man up!"" does not apply) and be emotionally in-touch enough to know the difference between banter and bullying and strong enough to moderate the former to prevent it becoming the latter, rather than joining in.At the moment we have some of the most interpersonally under-qualified and emotionally vacant people coaching the some of our most vulnerable young people, and if these people think that teaching a child to kick, pass or shoot is the sum of their job, then we - and they - are screwed.I think I digress... but if you've made it this far, perhaps you'd appreciate my other comments on this topic:"

29,"Here you go!First Year of ArticleshipMy CA final attempt was due in Nov 2017 and my preparations did not begin any earlier than other CA Final candidates. I had joined a mid-sized firm in Chennai in April 2015. My batch mates had already started their preparation and had joined various classes while my mind kept repeating that maybe it was too early! After considering facts and combating confusion for days I decided not to study in my first year. I decided to devote that year to cricket and was playing the 5th division of the Tamil Nadu Cricket Association League. Matches were usually held early in the morning, so this decision dint really create any impact my articleship. Apart from cricket, I was also interested in the stock market and started investing and reading about the same. One line summary –no CA Final preparation in the 1st year.Here is my performance in the league (not very great though)BattingBowlingCA Final Preparation in Second Year of ArticleshipHaving missed the bus on purpose in the 1st year, I had to make up for it in the 2nd year. While others were doing one class at a time, I was left with no option but to join two classes simultaneously. I joined FR and AMA in June 2016. I preferred classes over self-study for practical subjects because I always felt that the expert teaching the subject simplifies it and if I were to study the same on my own, I would end up spending twice the time to understand the concepts. I was very attentive in the class (when you sacrifice the early morning sleep, you better pay attention) and ensured that 60% of the preparation was done in my class itself, which is the whole point of joining a coaching class. Once the classes were done in September 2016, there was a 2-month break. I ensured that 80% of the preparation was done in these 2 months for FR and AMA. The focus was more on understanding the concepts rather than solving sums from the material ICAI had provided.The next set of classes began in December 2016 when I joined SFM and DT. Since I missed study in Year 1, I had to catch up on other subjects too. With 2 classes already ongoing, I decided to join Law in February 2017 too. At this stage, I had classes every day morning and evening, and articleship in between. The only reason I used to go home was to sleep. The moment I got into bed, I was almost dead! I literally felt so low at this stage that I decided to quit the Law class. That was when reality hit me hard and I realized that I had become a machine – running in cycles! My day was about getting up, going to class, then office, then again class, home, dinner, study, and sleep……..! Was there a life? No there wasn’t. My heart longed for the field. I was REALLY missing the early morning matches. I was desperate for a break but then that was a far fetched dream! And then one day it hit me that I hadn’t touched my cricket bat for almost a year! How could I stay away from the one thing I loved? The CA Final course had made me ignorant of everything beautiful I was surrounded by! Just when SFM and DT were about to get over, the registration for IDT classes had begun and batches were starting from the very next day. Break had become a Utopian concept then!IDT started in April 2017 and I just didn’t like the class. I quit it midway and started to prepare for the subject on my own. But then AMA and ISCA were also to be focused on! So well! I guess my summer of 2017 was planned!CA Final Preparation Plan in Study LeaveNot sure if this was the break I was looking for! My study leave started from June 2017 and I had solid 5 months for preparation time. Wait a minute, I hadn’t seen my love for more than a year. And a cricket tournament was lined up in June and July. I made up my mind to play the tournament and my Sundays were spent for my love. Played the tournament, got the man of the series award and parted with my beloved once ag..."

31,"Sounds like allergies, probably dust-mites. Dust-mites are microbes that eat dead skin-cells that nest in bedding-material, and they produce a waste-product which is a powerful allergen to many people.First, see an an allergist, and determine if you’re allergic to this or other possible causes. Be sure to tell the allergist about this problem, and ask what you can do about it, medications etc.2. Then, buy casing for your matress, box-springs and pillows, like these:Amazon.com: SLEEP SAFE BED BUG, DUST MITE, and ALLERGEN PROOF ""QUEEN 12"""" Mattress ZipCover, Size: Queen 60"" x 80"" x 12""deep ENCASEMENT L Zipper - compare price: Home & KitchenAmazon.com: Assure Sleep “Bed Bug Proof” Box Spring Encasement, 54 Inch X 75 Inch, Full Size: Home & KitchenAmazon.com: SLEEP SAFE BED BUG, DUST MITE, and ALLERGEN PROOF - STANDARD Pillow ZipCover, Size: Standard 21"" x 27"" Pillow ENCASEMENT: Home & Kitchen3. Likewise, buy a HEPA air-filter like this one to keep it by the bed:Amazon.com: GermGuardian AC4825, 3-in-1 Air Cleaning System with True HEPA, UV-C and Odor Reduction, 22-Inch: Health & Personal Care4. Next, be sure to keep the area vacuumed at least weekly.5. Finally, be sure to wash all sheets, blankets and pillowcases etc at least weekly in hot water.These protocols should help reduce any allergies from dust-mites, and other sources.Another good idea is a de-humidier, since dust-mites as well as molds grow in humidity, along with dust-mites,and these are the 2 primary sources of allergies.This is good not only against allergies, but also damage to your house, mold on the walls, etc, so a large-size dehumidifier is best."
32,"I agree with other answers over here. The probability of Nights King dishing out mercy is much more likely than expecting mercy from the Boltons, Cersei or any other dubious characters on the show.The mercy meter can be measured only by the number of people spared by a character. And quite surprisingly, the Nights Kings has the highest mercy rate among the characters the OP mentioned.He let Jon go at the Battle of Hardhome. He let Bran go after marking him.His plans or motives for letting these characters go might be dark but still I am going to count them as mercy, especially in the case of Jon.The Nights King isn't human and expectation of mercy from a non-human is a laughable concept but GRRM/ showrunners in their own ways have tried to convey the message that sometimes humans are way worse than our worst nightmares."

35,"Just because he says he doesn't want to take away our guns doesn't mean that's true. After all, rewind just a few months and you'll find him saying he would like to emulate Australia's gun laws. In case you don't know, Australia banned guns and confiscated existing guns in 1996. Diane Feinstein, Janet Reno, Hillary Clinton, and other high level politicians have said the same thing. They want to eventually ban guns. Fortunately for us, the law says they can't and the majority agrees. however, by changing small laws and introducing others, over time, there will be a de facto gun ban since they will simply be too expensive and onerous to own and buy for the average person.  for some reason, anti gun people can't or won't see past the immediate action. On paper it's not big deal. After all I think everyone wants to keep guns away from criminals and others who would use them for evil. Those of us on the other side however, who have seen this show many times, and have a vested interest, know that there are simply more laws and restrictions in the future when criminals continue to illegally get guns and crazy people keep shooting up public spaces. So next, we'll have a mandatory registration, and then who knows what after that. Taxes on our newly registered guns probably. mandated insurance since they know who has guns now. Just like Obamacare, mandatory insurance will be unaffordable for the majority. One of the main problems with this issue is that anti gun people don't want a gun and don't care about those of us who do. They will remove all our rights without a second thought because it doesn't affect them. What they don't realize is that it could affect them indirectly but by then it will be too late. the ship will have already sailed."

40,"I'll try to be serious and answer this question the best way I can. I have never heard of this internet phenomenon of ""Slav squatting"" until now, and I find it absolutely hilarious. I thought the whole world was squatting just like we are. You may laugh, but I am actually squatting on my chair while writing this. Now to the point. I will write from my point of view, and I don't know if it applies to the other people (Slavic people).First thing first: squatting simply feels comfortable for me. I lay my feet flat on the ground, my knees bent, and I rest my whole upper body on my knees and hamstrings. Sometimes I also squat on balls of my feet, putting few of my fingers on the ground for aditional stability.Sadly, most present day teenage and adult Slavs grew up in impoverished post-socialist countries. There were no videogames, and we didn't spent much time watching TV (There were only 3 channels in my country, none of them for the kids). We spent our time in parks and outdoors running, playing soccer, immitating cowboys and Indians, playing war games, and doing other silly things that (Slavic) kids do. When you get tired, you could either sit on the ground, as most parks and playgrounds didn't have benches, and get dirty, or squat. So squatting came naturally and became a habit for most kids.Also, most toilets in schools were squatting toilets, so that had some influence too. Even today I squat on my modern flush toilet. It simply feels better.Now for the photo thing. That comes from the pure utility: class photos were taken every year, and to make whole class of 30 student fit in one photo, boys were usually squatting in the first row, and girls were standing behind them in the second row. So the boys gained habit of taking photos in squatting position. Eventually, it became cool to take photos while squatting.I am sorry for my bad english, and I hope I gave you some insight on this squatting habit of ours."
41,When you say you got selected I assume that you have got the offer letter with you atleast. In this case rest assured you will get the joining/on-boarding confirmation mail sooner or later depending on the requirements of the company. Incase you didn't get any written confirmation from company after your interview I would suggest you not to loose heart and would request you to keep trying for other companies rather than waiting for confirmation from Cognizant. The confirmation will come if it has to but you shouldn't waste your time on a single company. There are multiple opportunities outside waiting for you.

43,"The consequences awaiting the vast majority of ‘rebels’ simply haven’t shown themselves yet. They may look like they are getting away with something but they are far more likely (not necessarily, of course, but definitely more likely) to be losers in the long run.Why?What happens in the long term to those who drink at an early age?Well, they are more likely to make even more bad decisions, of course (alcohol’s primary effect is to tell the brain “everything is ooookay,” especially when it isn’t). But they are also more likely to be unable to function in social situations with others without relying on alcohol, never learn to cope with stress except through alcohol, etc. These are skills that must be learned over an extended time and regular use of alcohol gets in the way of that.What happens to the rebel who regularly smokes?They are more likely to become addicted to the nicotine. And there’s a multibillion dollar industry full of chemists, psychologists and marketers standing by to make sure their future includes paying huge amounts of money to the tobacco company. If that happens to cost the rebel a lung, so be it; They’ve got shareholder value to improve and duping younger people into smoking are the means to that end.What happens to rebels who have promiscuous sex?They don’t learn what’s valuable in relationships. Maybe they learn to objectify people instead of learning to understand them. They may emotionally harm themselves or others (who weren’t as casual about the sex as they thought they would be). Maybe they catch a disease. And maybe they wind up starting a pregnancy at an age when they are completely unprepared for the huge responsibility of bringing a life into the world. (I am not an anti-sex zealot by any stretch, but do think people should recognize sex as something they should think carefully about, especially when young.)And what happens when the rebel skips out on their education?Without an education the rebel is more likely to make all the mistakes above and then some. They miss out on the knowledge that was offered to them, but more importantly: They never learn how to work hard. You may not realize it, but the bigger gift of all those school assignments is in how they teach people to work diligently towards goals (especially when that activity is not one’s favourite thing in the world), which is the foundation of achieving just about anything worthwhile. (If someone is skipping their classes to go work on their broader education in some meaningful way this can be a good thing, but I’m assuming that’s not what you’re talking about.)The more of these things someone “rebels” with, the more likely they are to limit their future options. (And generally, having options is the key to long term happiness.)Rebelling against the status quo is of incredible value to society and is how we make progress. Heck, there are many worthwhile causes that could use more rebels to work on them. But those who habitually “rebel” through these relatively trivial actions are selling their futures tragically short."

45,"Growing your account on Instagram is both difficult and time consuming, but with enough diligent effort you can inevitably grow your account steadily over time.Here’s what I think you can do to grow your account without Hashtags (although I feel they are quite important to IG growth).First this is what not to do;Don’t use Follow/Unfollow. I know.. I’m going against what a lot of people say but hear me out. This method was great 3–4 years ago, before Instagram had such a sophisticated algorithm. Now it’s almost inevitable your account will be labeled as a spam account. IG’s system categorizes accounts based on 3 criteria; Spam, User, Influencer. If you’re following and unfollowing 300, 400, 500 accounts a day, then the system realizes that this is not “normal” human behaviour. Nobody really uses IG in that nature, unless they’re a bot. IG hates bots and makes it an effort to shutdown those automated social media tools everyday.Another reason Why F/U method is not the greatest is because of it’s basis; people will ONLY follow you back as a courtesy and not because they truly love your content. This doesn’t build an engaged audience as they are mindlessly following whoever follows them. Then your account will become more of tool rather than a vehicle to share your content.2. Don’t pay for or buy fake followers. This is bad because it’s something that is going to ruin your accounts engagement rate in the long run. ER (engagement rate) is the average likes+comments you get on your posts / your follower amount. Most decent engagement rates hang around 3%-5%.Now What you should do.Post Great content consistently. Social Media is to share content and it’s the basis of what keeps these platforms alive. If you’re not feeding your account with the fuel it needs to run properly, you can’t expext any sort of decent following what so ever.Post at the right times. User apps such as UNUM (iOS/Android) to see what your best time are, so that you can get the most engagement and get more exposure.Create or get invited to DM Groups. Reach out to accounts in your niche and create what’s called a DM Group. These are groups that are made on the app itself, 15 max, in which all participants agree to like+comment on each others posts as soon as possible.Use relevant hashtags. Hashtags are the basis of exposure on social media, as people that are interested in certain topics use them to look for stuff they’re interested in. Start by looking at what tags accounts you look up to use and then start compiling a list of related ones. Make sure to circulate your tags as you don’t want to be shadowbanned for using the same ones repetitively.Use these tips and I’m sure your account will grow!"

It was kind of like the “Infinities” comics, where they just did a bunch of non canon stuff that they thought would be cool.It was actually a clone of Darth Maul.There was a ton of stuff like that going on back then that the mixed up book and comic EU even considered fake “what if “ stories, mainly just for fun.Look up Star Wars Infinities Omnibus if you're interested in seeing more."
47,"I am not able to understand the question clearly. Does it mean what are the various stages that lead to breakup or what are the various stages after break up happens.Still I will try to answer, keeping the second assumption in mind, that is what are the stages after breakup.Break up is always painful, always  the only exception being when one of the partners  was just manipulating or playing with the other one. Then of course it is planned from one side so no pain there. But tremendous pain to the other side.The first feeling after a breakup is a shattering pain, something that just tears you from inside. You may cry shout shriek and go into bouts of non acceptance where you would desperately want to go back to the person and beg and plead for everything to be normal. Some people are able to control the urge others cant and do this literally. Anyways the pain is immense... it just breaks you!.Second phase is of a realization that it has happened and if the breakup was mutual due to reasons which both partners understand(which seldom is the case) the feeling is easier to seep in. In case it is not, it is a deep hurt which gradually converts into hatred for the other person to have done this to you. You accuse and blame the other person for doing this to you. Next you gradually start to come out of it, start gathering yourself together and want to look forward to new things in life. You would want to forget about it and put your energies somewhere else, be it a hobby, your work or friends etc. Though you want to forget but something inside still keeps hurting somewhere.Last is the phase of indifference where it just doesn't matter anymore. You neither love nor hate, you just become indifferent to the existence of the other person. And thats when you start forgiving and getting over it completely. On a person to person basis these phases may take months to years. The deeper the relationship, the longer will be the impact."

49,"Having been through very deep depression for over a decade in my life l understand how you feel. I didn't think I would ever have friends in my life for years but I learned some things I'd like to share with you as my life is completely different now and people look to me to teach them communication and how to build rapport.There are lots of great answers to your question so I'll try to give you new suggestions.Here's a basic fact...People want to be happy and are attracted to people and activities that make them happier.Notice how true that is in your own life.Being attractive to people (not physically but emotionally) is the key.Here are my suggestions...Become great at asking questions to get people to talk. We all love to talk about ourselves but that's the problem in life, we want to talk not listen. Therefore becoming great at listening by becoming great at asking questions is a valuable skill. A long time ago I learned an acronym that had been super successful at helping me build rapport with strangers to start to meet people to make friends easily. FORM. I use FORM as a structure to ask questions. F stands for family, so sample questions are, are you married, how long for? Do you have kids? O stands for occupation so questions are like, what do you do for a living? How long have you worked there? R stands for recreation, so questions are like, what do you like to do when you're not working, do you have any hobbies? And M stands for money. Questions relating to money can be, are you happy with how much you're making, do you invest in shares or property, which one do you think is best? I can have a conversation with a stranger for an hour with these questions because people love to talk if someone genuinely cares enough to listen. Try this out and you'll be amazed at how easy it is to talk to people.Focus on improving your own level of happiness. Happiness is our natural state of mind that comes about if we don't get caught up in our emotions, feelings and negative thoughts. We're like a cork under water that always wants to float to the surface. It's our dwelling on the past that pulls us down or 'anchors' to negative events in our past that prevent our natural happiness from rising to the surface. Letting go of the negative thoughts as soon as they come into the mind is the key. Becoming conscious of thoughts that turn into feelings that make us feel bad is the beginning of avoiding them. Letting go is an awesome and powerful concept and asking yourself does it really matter with things that bother you helps you to clear the energy of these thoughts and events as they come up.Stop resisting feeling happy and loving. Often we train ourselves to resist feeling happy and loving because we feel we have no right to. It's the complete opposite in fact. We should be happy and loving no matter what because the state of mind we get into determines if we are going to suffer or transcend the situation or not. When we're in a happy or loving state of mind our brains think more positively about solutions. When we're unhappy it perpetuates and we can't solve the problems we are experiencing. Happiness is a state of mind we have to choose dozens or hundreds of times. It's not easy but slowly over time you'll get better by letting go and choosing happiness.Practice making positive comments. Set a goal to pay someone a compliment every day. After achieving the goal practice giving five in a day. Something magical will happen from this. You'll become happier!Learn about yourself. This is the key to happiness. I recommend having your DISC Profile assessment as the principle of the four profiles was identified over two thousand years ago so it's not new and very established. I believe this is the most beneficial subject there is to learn in life! Your ability to be happy has everything to do with how well you understand and get along with people and DISC Profiles provide enormous insight into how to get along with the 75% of people who aren't your DISC Profile.Learn about introverts, extroverts and ambiverts. It helps you to relate and communicate with people who aren't like you.Forgive people. Forgiving people makes you happier because it takes away your feeling you need to judge, punish or condemn people and let the world take care of them with rewards or punishment, which is called karma. Letting people have their own karma frees up the negative energy associated with guilt you think others should feel. And lastly forgive yourself. Often people suffer and struggle in life because of some ""program"" running inside them if guilt or shame so they punish themselves for it and wallow in misery. Letting go of all that crap is the key to happiness.Here's a video intro to DISC Profiles you may enjoy that I made..."

There’s probably something going on in her life that she would like to share with you, but she is afraid that you won’t understand, that you will judge her or criticize her.She is not looking for you to solve her problems. She is not looking for you to tell her why what she feels does not make sense. She simply wants to share what she thinks and feels, and she wants to know that it’s valid (And it is! Every single feeling, no matter how irrational, is valid.)Talk to her and try to do NOTHING ELSE but understand. Tell her that what she is feeling is completely natural, and that you will always love her and accept her, no matter what, because she is your daughter and a good person.How can you get her to open up? Maybe try giving her a personal experience, a point in your life when you were sad. When you share this, do not judge yourself. Do not tell her that what you were feeling did not make sense. Tell her that it was very hard for you and all you wanted was for someone to share your troubles with who would understand you without judgement. Once she feels safe, she may open up, and when she feels like you’ve heard her and really understand, she may actually ask for your advise!"
53,"The best food I have eaten is a very specific type of Idly called Mallige Idly. By this sentence most Indians will know that I am a south Indian. Anyway, almost a month back, there was a war going on twitter. Gordon Ramsay v/s South Indians. Just because he said our every day food which is Idly and vada looked like prison food for him.. Frankly speaking, it hurt me.. Because I am no prisoner and the food I eat is in fact so healthy that many hospitals serve them on a daily basis to its patients and many doctors recommend this to be consumed on a daily basis as it causes zero affect on health. But, I am least bothered as I know what Idly is made of and how tasty it is and he is the one who is at loss as he will never be able to taste what we taste.Moving on let me describe how this became my favorite food.. As long as i remember, my mom used to make terrible Idlies.. They were full of rava and i hated it (sorry mom). So I could hardly eat idly. But, it was twice a week mandatory breakfast at our place.. we had to eat it as breakfast and then take it to school for lunch.. But, at school i would eat other’s lunch to satisfy my taste buds..I am from Mysore, so the famous festival Dasara gives us a lot of opportunity to have variety of food.. There will be fair and exhibits of lot of stuff which can be bought and also lot of tasty food.. Its called “Mysuru Dasara exhibition”.We used to go there every year as there will be lot of games to play for children (which I wanted to to back then). When I was 9 or 10 years old we were walking in the exhibition, looking around for something exciting to eat with my mom and my brother.. My mom saw that there is a stall of “Mysore Mallige Idly”. So she took us there. She ordered 2 plates of Mallige Idly. One for her and me and one more for my elder brother.. As I used to waste a lot of food back then, she wanted me to taste it first..Maillige idly usually will be served with 2 or 3 types of chutney as shown in the below photo.But, the size and shape of the mallige idly was not like the one in the photo. Just to give you a rough idea.. Have a look at the below picture which shows the thickness of a idly.But, a mallige idly will be 1.5 times thicker that the one in the picture. A lot softer, in fact it will be so soft few people call it sponge idly.. literally it will be like a sponge if to try squeezing it.. but it will not be chewey at all.. it will just melt in the mouth..So, continuing the story. My mom smeared some red chutney and some green chutney and a broken piece of Mallige idly and gave it to me for tasting.. Just for me to decide, if I wanted it or not.. I just put it in my mouth and the flavours of red chilly, ginger, garlic, coconut, coriander, curry leaves, Roasted gram (Hurigadale), with occasional encounter of muster seeds, along with all these the the soft soft mallige idly started bursting in my mouth.. It just melted like butter in my mouth.. I felt like i just visited heaven..I had never tasted anything like that before.. So, i ended up eating 3 or 4 plates of mallige idly that day.. My mom had to call it a day and drag me out of that place..Since then, my mom kept trying and trying to make those idlies. But, till date she hasn’t been successful.. But, the idly of hers has improved a lot.. now i like my mom’s idlies..But, after that, over the period of several years, I have tried Mallige idlies at several places none of them were like the one that i ate that day.. I used to hunt for Mallige idlies in and around mysore but, dint find anything even close to that.. One of my uncle said there is one place near pandavapura (Mandya district) where, in a small house one old man prepares mini idlies which tastes similar to mallige idly.. Immediately I told my dad (he is my partner for all kinds of food exploration, we always keep each other updated on “New good places to eat in Mysore” he is a big time foodie) that we should go there.. so the next day morning we left mysore by 6 am rode on a two wheeler for almost 40 kms (approx) for few plates of Idly.. But, trust me it was worth it.. we enjoyed the journey and the food was amazing (Not a mallige idly. But, fantastic idlies) I would have eaten 3 -4 plates there too..So there it is the best food ever eaten..P.S: I am still searching on the Dasara Exhibitions every year to find that perfect mallige idly. So far I have not been successful.. Anyone knows any place in Bangalore or Mysore which serves awesome mallige idly.. Please let me know.. A hungry soul is waiting to be satisfied."
54,"You’re asking the wrong question. The correct thing to ask would be how much CAs and tax officers can affect GST. And trust me friend, they would affect GST a lot more than you can imagine.Whenever there is a transition from one system of tax to another, there are a lot of issues involved. Here are some examples to give you a hint:What happens to existing VAT and CENVAT credit?How about all the exemptions that I was eligible for earlier but not in GST?I had a pending refund claim of service tax, how do I get it back in GST?My business was not registered under state VAT, what now?Most of my raw material is purchased by paying VAT, how do I claim credit now?I never paid excise duty because I was under the exemption limit, but now?And you see, these are just very obvious issues that I could write about without thinking much. There are going to be a lot of issues like this which would need to be addressed. Who do you think will do all of that?There are going to be a lot of litigation cases, and a lot of interpretation issues. Tax officers on the one side, and CAs (or lawyers) on the other side would continue to argue for many years over every detail of the law unless almost everything is settled by the courts. That would take years of litigation.Further, it is actually this implementation and interpretation which would help to shape a stable and sensible law over a course of time. All of that will happen with the help of CAs, tax officers and lawyers.Thus the question isn’t how GST would affect them; but rather how they would affect GST."
55,"Former director Cliff Bowman quoted the following statistics for the RSI 2008 selection process:Last year, we had about 940 valid applications (passed the citizenship and year of graduation check, provided enough information that we could evaluate the file).  From this pool, we invited 47 students to the program.  There were an additional 3 DoDEA students and 30 international students selected through other means.In other words, at one point there was a 5% acceptance rate for domestic applicants (though probably lower now).Obviously, the process is not easy, but the acceptance rate only says so much. On one hand, some worthy students don't know to apply to RSI in the first place. On the other hand, most of the students who do are very intense, making the single-digit acceptance rate seem even more grim. In some ways, RSI can be even more selective than admissions at many top colleges, which have a less self-selecting pool of applicants. 47 of the 61 participants of RSI 2009 for which I have college data ended up attending HYPSM (37 HM); most of the ones who did were cross-admitted to at least two or three, and most of the 14 who didn't were international students (some of whom didn't apply to U.S. colleges and universities).I can tell you, though, that the selection process takes into account a huge number of subjective factors, including essays (which are very important) and recommendation letters. Yes, some of the admits are MOPers, IChO medalists, or ISEF Finalists (and later Siemens and STS Finalists), but just as many had relatively minor honors in comparison. The selection committee tries to do a thorough job of taking into account each student's unique background and trying to piece together an assessment of his or her talents and potential.I, for one, had never been invited to any of the Olympiad camps (and most aren't), nor had I even competed in ISEF. Compared to some of the applicants with a huge number of awards or extensive research experience (research experience helps but is a bit overrated), I paled by comparison. However, I brought to the table strong enough grades and test scores to show that I was academically competent (seven 5's on APs, 237 PSAT, 4.0 GPA), a modest track record of extracurriculars (National Science Olympiad medals, Science Bowl, USABO/USAPhO semis), a very strong letter of recommendation from my high school research advisor (who ended up also writing me a college letter of recommendation), and essays into which I had poured my heart and soul. It also certainly helped that I was from the Midwest and that my high school had sent a student to RSI the previous year (and one each two years after me).I should also add that the selection committee chooses at least a couple ""wild cards"" each year who might not be your traditional HYPSM admits. In some cases, as with college admissions, all it takes to get admitted is for something special in your application to stand out to a couple of committee members.

They are called “Limbal Rings”, they are completely benign (in fact, it’s mostly due to the optical properties of the eye), they usually appear more pronounced in individuals with light irides (i.e., people with blue or green eyes, for example), but they also tend to soften or become less pronounced as one gets older.This is what a typical Limbal Ring looks like:That being said, a less benign version or rings around the iris is called “Kayser–Fleischer rings”, which is the result of a liver disease.

62,"Oh gosh, NO.Aside, from the fact that the “book” itself was more of a play manuscript than an actual novel, which made reading harder to digest, there were so many uses bad of storytelling, character inconsistencies and themes which honestly made the book a headache to read.Now, before I tear this book to shreds, there were some good things that I’d like to say about Harry Potter and The Cursed Child.SPOILERs but hey this book’s not worth reading yet anyway.Good Things:Up until they introduced the time-travelling plot device, I thought the storyline was actually going smoothly. I liked how they introduced Harry Potter’s kid, Albus Severus, as this student who’s constantly living under his father’s shadow and that unlike Harry, he’s never had any fun or memorable adventures before the inciting incident, thus he’s always looked down upon by everyone else for not living up to his father’s guise.The fact that he was placed in Slytherin instead of Gryffindor would have really made for some really good conflict. I actually liked the fact that he was placed in Slytherin instead of Gryffindor. It would have been interesting to see the majority of the kids in Gryffindor as the antagonists of the story, something fresh and new and a complete role reversal from the previous books. We’d be able to see that not all the kids in Slytherin are mean, evil bullies but can actually be decent people. But sadly, this theme was not fully explored.Bad thingsMaking Harry Potter into this asshole character. I understand characters develop over time but I thought this version of Harry deviated too much from the one in the previous books. In the previous books, Harry was this brave, selfless yet impulsive guy who’s willing to risk his life to save his friends. In this book, he asks Albus to sever his friendship to Scorpius, one of the few friends he has in Hogwarts, and he even yelled at him saying that he wish he didn’t have a son like him. I thought Harry was a little too unlikeable and someone who’s far different than what he was in the books.Hermione’s dark future. There was this alternate timeline in which Hermione became this bitter, angry Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher after she lost Ron and that’s not what Hermione is like! She’s logical, smart, calm and not the kind of character who would have let her future and actions be defined by a guy. Its basically saying Hermione is dependent on Ron for her happiness and Hermione is too strong and independent of a character who would let a guy dictate her choices.Bellatrix and Voldemort. In the previous books, Voldemort has been established as this cold, calculating villain who doesn’t care about anyone but himself. The fact that he did it with Bellatrix is about as plausible as discovering a sugar cube on Mars, it doesn’t fit with his character at all. It just made for a bunch of character inconsistencies and derailed his personality. It’s like the author was playing a game of darts and decided to randomly assign a “shocking” event just to make another useless plot twist.The Whole time-travelling plot. Time-travelling is one of the trickier plot devices to put in any medium, wether it be a book or a movie. In my opinion, a story should not revolve around time-travelling, as it’s a device best used for a one-off story element. Time travelling worked in Prisoner of Azkaban as it’s not focused throughout the whole book, since the story relied on elements of mystery to make the story flow. Questions like: Who is Sirius Black? How did Voldemort find Harry’s parents? Who is Peter Pettigrew? These questions keep the reader interested and push the story through. I don’t think Cursed Child has any of those elements and it’s just a bad Harry Potter fan fic of these kids moving to fan fic A, then going to fan fic B and then going to fan fic C.Wasted Potential.

63,"Is there a thought process or belief system attached to the depression? What I mean is, are there circumstances that you think about and become depressed, or do you have a negative self-image, or feel some external force is somehow making your life hard? In my case, I have a very good life - great marriage, great job, etc., but couldn't seem to enjoy my life. I felt either sad, irritable or numb all the time. I sought help because it seemed more chemical than psychological or circumstantial. I was diagnosed with bipolar II. If it's more situational for you, or you feel you somehow deserve what you are feeling, I encourage you to seek a therapist or psychologist to find the root cause and learn techniques to cope. I do both - take the medication to balance out the bipolar disorder and see a therapist when I'm struggling with something that I need more than advice from loved ones about."

66,"I have answered a similar query Renuka Rajendran's answer to What are some of the greatest novels of all time? Why are they great?However I have left out a few absolute treasures in the list, and since I wrote that answer I have read a couple of books which just have to be included in the list of best books ever written, so here goes my list! I've limited my answer to works of fiction alone. I must add that the answer contains SPOILERS throughout.Thomas Hardy:1.Far from the madding crowd (Beautifully written book that charmingly portrays the rural landscape. The heroine is a bit vain and rejects a man who is good in every way but too simple for her tastes, but it all ends well in the end)2.Return of the Native(The dictionary defines heath as “An area of open uncultivated land, esp. in Britain, with characteristic vegetation of heather, gorse, and coarse grasses”. Not very appealing, right? But there is only one author who can make even the heath sound romantic and have you think wistfully that you were there, as he takes you through the various facets of it. You can almost feel the wrath of the stormy winds, the chills of the misty nights, the silence of its mysterious nature. ‘See’ its subtle, if not so charming, beauty. ’Return of the Native’-an enchanting, deeply moving book.3.Tess of the DurbervillesCharles Dickens:4.A tale of two cities( An epic story of love, war, sacrifice and loyalty. The ending lines in the closure of the novel which are the final thoughts of a man who sacrifices himself for the woman he loves is still etched in my heart ““It is a far, far better thing that I do, than I have ever done; it is a far, far better rest that I go to"" I think it’s one of the first novels that made me cry inconsolable tears. )5.Oliver Twist( This book did not fail to make me shed a few tears over the way poor little orphaned Oliver was treated by some cruel people who were supposed to take care of him. And when Dick says his farewell to Oliver! That was the first occasion on which Oliver had ever encountered kindness. Thank God for the happy ending for Oliver though-Dick dies)6.Great expectations(another masterpiece of Dickens’)7.David Copperfield(This book has one of the best female characters in all books I’ve read-Agnes. Lovely, kind, intelligent she’s loved David all her life and finally a tad thickheaded as he is, David realizes the fact and they get together.)George Elliot:(one of the best writers in English!)8.Middlemarch(One of the best books I’ve read with so many interesting characters in it.Dorothea, Will, Lydgate and Mary were my favorites. Beautiful written prose, insights into each character and their thought process, the problems they encounter and their reaction to it, kept me hooked to the end. A book that shows that even intelligent women in those times found it difficult to carry out an action they knew to be right without a man's approval and that how often what we perceive of others is so wrong!)9.Mill on the Floss(Another favorite of mine, even more beautifully written than Middlemarch if that’s possible and one that I connected with more than any other because it has sibling love in it.)Jane Austen10.Pride and Prejudice(Another favorite female character of all novels I’ve read-Elizabeth Bennett. Enough said!)11.Sense and sensibility12.Emma(A woman that is a shining example to her gender)13.Persuasion(Best novel of Jane Austens’ in my opinion and a must read!)14.Mansfield ParkRobert Louis Stevenson:15.Kidnapped (Best novel by this author. One couldn’t help sympathizing with David-the Hero in the book and I read the book hastily to see what destiny awaited him after he was arranged to be kidnapped by his own uncle to deprive him of his rightful property. His friendship with Alec whom he comes to love like a brother and whose affection is reciprocated- and how much he misses him when he has to part ways w..."
67,"Benjamin Franklin hypothesized that lightning is an electrical phenomenon, and that the electrical effect of lightning might be transferable to another object and cause an effect that could be recognized as electricity. He did a famous Kite experiment to prove this hypothesis.In 1752 in Philadelphia Ben Franklin decided did this experiment. With the help of his son, William, he attached his kite to a silk string, tying an iron key at the other end. Next, they tied a thin metal wire from the key and inserted the wire into a leyden Jar , a container for storing an electrical charge. Leyden Jar is shown belowFinally, as the sky darkened and a thunderstorm approached, they attached a silk ribbon to the key. Holding onto the kite by the silk ribbon, Ben flew the kite and once it was aloft, he retreated into a barn so that he would not get wet. The thunder storm cloud passed over Franklin's kite, whereupon the negative charges in the cloud passed onto his kite, down the wet silk string, to the key, and into the jar. Ben however, was unaffected by the negative charges because he was holding the dry silk ribbon, insulating him from the charges on the key. When he moved his free hand near the iron key, he received a shock. Why? Because the negative charges in the key were so strongly attracted to the positive charges in his body, a spark jumped from the key to his hand. Franklin's experiment successfully showed that lightning was static electricity. One can experience this same reaction while rubbing feet on a carpet and then touching the metal doorknob.Ben was lucky to survived this dangerous experiment as many who performed this same kite experiment were electrocuted.This was one of experiment that was done to display the electrical energy stored in lightening. I am hopeful that the day will come when lightening will be harnessed for generating electrical energy to meet our energy needsSource of content and pictures : internet and Google images"
68,"★★★★★A2AI am assuming that you are new to performance testing (PT) and need to know how it is to work as a performance tester. I may stray into Performance Engineering (PE) while answering which is the superset of PT involving root-cause analysis and fixing the issues. I am not an authority and whatever I am answering is based upon a little experience I happen to have. Here are the different viewpoints:Career Prospects: Let me be very Frank – there are not a lot of companies who would want their product to go through performance evaluation, there are several reasons for it.Number one reason is the lack of vision. Many managers or even the product owners do not have the vision of how a performance evaluation may help them in future. They are just eager to push the damn thing to production where it can start serving rather than having a product with good all-around quality.The application has too few users.Deciding against PT due to the high cost it carries mainly because of expensive tools and workforce.Having said that and going by the rules of the nature, as the demand is less the supply is also low. You would see very few people opting it as this is a specialized service.Even the companies like TCS, Infosys etc. which have a workforce running into hundred thousands have just a few hundred performance testers.‘Good’ performance testers are even fewer. What makes you a good performance tester?The qualities are, but not limited to the following:To be able to ‘size’ the load. It’s a huge topic whose details can be found via any search engineTo be able to ‘script’ using a wide range of tools including commercial tools as well as open source.Expert on various operating systems like Windows, Red Hat etc.Knows shell scriptingTo be able to analyze the results and identify the problemTo be able to find the root cause of the problem which is called the bottle neckGood in SQL, knows the architecture and how DBMS works at grass root level.Excellent is networking conceptsQuick learnerHas an eye for detailExcellent communicator Learning CurveAs evident from the list of skills you need – the learning curve is a little steep. It’s not something you learn quickly. Some of the things need training while majority of things can only be learnt by experience. I cannot stress enough on the number of tools you are expected to have ‘expertise’ on. New things are introduced all the time and you have to keep yourself updated all the time. This holds true for almost all IT related skills. Work-Life BalanceYour usual day will be as it is for others in the software industry, especially in India, which means having little to no social life in the weekdays. The only silver lining is that your work will never get monotonous.Most clients would not want you to choke their resources in usual business hours so be prepared for off-hours execution.Usually senior testers are required to travel a lot. What Next?You could start from learning a tool of your choice as people consider that as an entry criteria to get into PT. Later on – you could look to acquire more skills and eventually graduate to a more advance level of PE. There are ample opportunities around the world. A lot of people also get into freelance or consulting roles. Things to RememberOnly get into PT if it is something you really want to do. No because you ‘can’ do or ‘should’ do.Once you decide to get into it, give it everything. It needs a lot of hard work to perfect – like every other skill but even the skills required to ‘just get the work done’ are not easy to acquire.Few people would underestimate your work saying “record aur play hi karna hai ji” (you just need to record and play) whereas recording and playing takes just 10 to 15% of the effort. Forgive and ForgetMost people will not understand what you do including your project managerProjects are short term and usually get over in 2-3 months.Let me know if you want me to add more."
69,"The “dark side” you refer to is called history.The Germans had two major events which instill the importance of privacy to them:The Nazis’ use of birth and census records to identify certain ethnic groups for extermination, the best-known of which were the German Jews;The former East German government’s use of listening devices and snitches to seek out government opponents.All school-age Germans learn about the Holocaust and these privacy violations in school as part of their education, and that privacy violations have led to awful consequences which are an indelible part of German history.This is why most Germans know that while there are shortcomings to broad privacy protection, going the other way has led to much more terrible things."

71,"There are different things to look for depending on how the narcissist views you. The easiest one is if you are a potential romantic partner. Look for idealization and for the narcissist to try and match your interests or personality. You might also be on the sidelines and seeing the narcissist idealizing someone as a third party.""OH he's just perfect!!!"" ""Oh look how sweet he is. OMG he works so hard"".If you are the romantic interest, things like ""I feel soo strongly about everything you just said."" ""Wow you are so amazing you must work so hard to be so smart"" ""you must be so brave to do X. Everybody loves you!"" ""you must bla bla bla.""The narcissist won't even realize they are doing this. They've lacked honest love in childhood and so they just walk around mimicking it in adult hood. To them, they really are in love after just 3 conversations. For the partner, this can feel amazing, until the relationship starts to actually develop and the partner realizes the narcissist has no idea of how to really give love (compliments and puppy dog eyes are not love after all). At this point it can never be the narcissist's fault that a relationship doesn't work. It must be the partners fault and they become devalued. Out goes the idealization and the partner becomes an object to the narcissist. They will use them until they don't need them anymore. This is the area where most relationships with narcissists exist.Narcissist aren't satisfied with your love, but they want your attention. Once they have it, their mindset shifts into""IS THIS LOVE GOOD ENOUGH FOR ME? THERE IS PROBABLY BETTER LOVE SOMEWHERE AND I WANT IT.""Or,""What does everyone think about me for loving this person? Are they judging me? Am I missing out being more admired for not having a more attractive/ambitious/hard working/ wealthy/good hearted/ partner?""They will secretly start resenting you. They will secretly start being ashamed of you. They will secretly start logging things that they believe are bad about you. However they can't tell you this, because then they'll lose your attention. But the resentment eventually comes out in mistreatment and abuse. The partner might then pull away and the narcissists will repeat the cycle of charming and devaluing. In the meantime, people outside the relationship are being told that the narcissist isn't really interested in the relationship, they are only doing it because '[insert immature reason here]'. Knowing this, here are the things you can look for before being a victim.Look for:Idealizationlots of short lived relationshipslots of blaming partners in past relationships for the failurelots of acquaintances but no close friends(intimacy is very hard for narcissists. They will feign intimacy with their friends but they don't really have it.)an extreme concern for their image- physical, social or both.an extreme concern for either not being judged or being judged highly.This will either come off as shyness or confidence. A confident narcissist always has to be in the spotlight if it's a chance for them to gain admiration. A SHY narcissist is preoccupied with avoiding the spotlight, particularly if it might end up in praise, because they fear judgement and jealousy. Narcissists are generally very envious and jealous of other peoples successes. As such, they believe others will be jealous and envious of them. This freaks out a shy narcissist because a shy narcissist wants to be loved by everyone.Narcissist target people to develop relationships with as opposed to letting relationships develop through natural interactions.A narcissist will say ""that person will be a good boyfriend/friend. I want their attention, resources, focus."" Then they'll figure out how to make it happen by pretending to be someone that person would need or want. An excellent example I read, probably here on QUORA, was the Jr. High/High School crush scenarios most of us experienced in our youth. We liked somebody so we pretended to be into their favorite band, or like their favorite food, or into musical theater because it allowed us to get their attention. Obviously these interactions are of very little value because they are disingenuous. A narcissist ONLY interacts this way with people. Because they've been doing it forever they become very good at it. It becomes very hard to recognize the dishonesty in their act. The narcissist themselves might not even recognize it's an act. They might be doing it out of habit, they might not know there are other ways of being.Splitting and devaluingThere is no grey with narcissists. Grey counts as black. EVERYONE is grey so once relationships develop beyond simple friendships people quickly become devalued. This is when the narcissist ""realizes"" the person they fell in love or developed a friendship with is not actually a worthy person. There is something wrong with them. At this point the relationship quickly shifts to one of resource acquisition. The narcissist will now use the friend or partner for narcissistic supply and resources. Once the other person loses their use, the narcissist discards them like an old appliance. In the mean time a lot of manipulation is occurring to keep the resource supply available. If you are a partner they will continue to play the role of ""you are so wonderful. I love you"" but with a lot less inspiration. Or they will say things like ""I would love you more if you just did this right, that right, this right"" etc... There is always something the partner is doing wrong. This comes from the mentality mentioned above. The narcissists behavior will no longer match the feelings they claim to have. This becomes very hard for the partner. If the partner tries to distance themselves the narcissist comes back in full force with claims of love. Eventually however, they will abandon them. They will just wait it out for when they no longer need them. If they discard something, i mean someone, and then realize they need it again they will come back to the old appliance to get more use out of it. People are objects to a narcissist. They live in a world where only one person exists. Themselves.RageWhen a narcissist isn't raging they are abusing subtly. It is subtle enough that people on the receiving-end are confused about it. They know they don't feel good but it's hard for them to pinpoint why. But when a narcissist experiences an event that challenges a channel they receive narcissistic supply from, that abuse becomes acute and intensified. When these channels are compromised or removed, the need to fix the channel completely overtakes the narcs psyche. The narc will do two things: make it their number 1 priority to punish the offender or do everything they can to bring the offender back into their camp. Things here can get really intense, and unfortunately, it's not until a person is at the receiving end of narcissistic rage that they wake up to who they are dealing with. Expect emotional extremes from suicide to murder during a narcissistic rage episode. Everything in between is possible, crying, hitting, threats, screaming, breaking things, stalking, pleas of love, desperate requests for forgiveness. The narcs false-reality is compromised and they'll do everything they can to keep the truth from slipping in. The need to keep the truth out is intense and it's at the core of why NPD's rarely admit faults or seek therapy.History of family mental illnessThere is a lot of evidence cluster A and B personality disorders are genetic. If another family member has been diagnosed with more easily diagnosable disorders like schizophrenia, schizotypical, or avoidant personality disorders, the likelihood of someone having a cluster A or B disorder increases. If the parents have issues then it is extremely likey they've developed a disorder simply because the parents have been socializing them to manipulate and view the world through a distrustful and fearful lens.I've tried to keep these traits ubiquitous to the two main types of narcissism. There is overt/arrogant narcissism (think steve jobs and dick cheney) and then there is covert/shy narcissism (think of the sweet innocent girl who is reserved and quiet). They each have their own traits but the fundamentals are the same. They have lacked love and connection with other human beings throughout childhood and are now out to acquire something like love to make up for it in adulthood. The lack of love has instilled a sense of worthlessness and insecurity. As a defense to this low self esteem they develop delusions of grandiosity. Shy narcissist use this defense but they deal with the delusions a bit differently. You can look up covert narcissism and overt narcissism for unique traits to each disorder."
72,"Your question consists of two parts:one is how to speak confidently and another is how to speak fluently.Let me make it short for you.First of all confident comes when you feel that you are perfect in speaking English and that feeling will not come overnight.simple answer is that you need to work hard.This working hard nature develops only if you are in very high need of English.I mean it is not as easy as asking question in quora.Here I suggest you that don’t simply say I want to learn English,instead do something for accomplishing it.The following are the things that you should do to speak confidently:Initially,start speaking in English with your inner conscience.You will never succeed if you don’t take any bold step.Believe me completely.You are going to win over this challenge if you start immediately.I saw many people who take many suggestions but never implement when time arrives.I request you to follow strictly.Now the second thing is use the IELTS application which enables you to speak with strangers.NOTE:Speak only with a motto to develop English in that very app.Don’t waste time in speaking unnecessary things with those who speak dirty words.Just hang up if you come across them.SUGGESTION:Don’t expect results immediately.Go on following things for a period of time. On one particular day you will find the results.For some it may take 5 months;for some it may be 1 year. It all depends on how often you practice it.Finally,your confidence levels depends on how much you practices daily either speaking with inner conscience or in IELTS.You know,indirectly speaking English confidently and fluently depends even on how much you suffer daily,because of lack of speaking English skills.This is because every time you suffer, your wish for speaking English increase gradually.Try to create strong necessity for learning English.Coming to next part of question how to speak fluently?Many people fail to speak fluently because of lack of words.Yes,it is because of lack of words.Let me break the phrase.Lack of words means people don’t have exact words to be used at that instance.People fail to express their views because of the same reason.Let me put forward few more tips to be followed:You need to have lots of words in your mind in order to express your views freely.All you need to do is to watch a lot of English movies with subtitles initially,read English News Papers daily and the most importantly inculcate the habit of thinking in English.Do every possible thing to improve your vocabulary as it helps you to use exact words in times of need with out saying aaaaa for longer period while speaking..Last and final thing is that imitate the accent of the speakers who speaks fluently.This will helps you in the course of time to speak fluently.I think this would help you.Please follow the suggestions without any delay.Thank you.Best of Luck!"

74,"I would agree with David Friedman that if the objective is to become a wealthy gambler the best strategy is to start out wealthy. But if you don’t have that luxury, the coolest story I know is that of Chris Ferguson. Described in an old New Yorker article as “tall and lanky, with very long brown hair and a brown goatee; his admirers call him Jesus.” Abridged version follows (and if the abridged version is too long; bold text tells the story):Ferguson was born in Los Angeles in 1963. His mother, Beatriz, was a mathematician and his father, Tom, taught game theory at U.C.L.A. Tom Ferguson brought home specialized board games and card games and taught them to Chris and his older brother, Marc, who is now a computer programmer. “Whenever there was a rainy day, we would get to stay inside and play Risk,” Tom Ferguson told me. His younger son “learned to think about playing and strategies and what other people know about what you know. It’s not important in chess, but it’s important in poker. It’s a rather deep game, when you get involved.”…At seventeen, accompanied by some of them, he began making occasional trips to Las Vegas. He and his friends would pool gas money, sleep in cheap hotels, and eat at the buffets. He liked Vegas because the people in the casinos called him “sir,” and “you could lean back in your chair and no one would yell at you, unlike school.” His friends went for fun, but Ferguson went to establish whether he played poker well. “I saw Vegas as a challenge,” he told me. “Play ten hours a day, pay for my room and my food, and get home with more money than I started with. I think of that as my transition into manhood—when I was able to prove to myself that if I had no support from my family, and no job, as long as I could get to Vegas, and have a hundred dollars in my pocket, I could survive.”…As an undergraduate, at U.C.L.A., Ferguson thought that joining the swing-dance club would be a good way to meet people, and now he is an expert dancer. He met his girlfriend, a Brazilian woman named Fabiola Gomes, at a night club. Gomes, a personal trainer, is petite and animated, with thick ringlets of dark hair. They live in her house in Las Vegas. Until two years ago, Ferguson, who is forty-five, lived mostly with his parents.…His thesis adviser was Leonard Kleinrock, whose lab sent what was considered the first message over the Internet, in 1969. Kleinrock told me that Ferguson was “one of the more brilliant and creative young men that I’ve known in my career at U.C.L.A.” During the late eighties, Ferguson was working as a programmer for a more advanced doctoral candidate when the student got a result he couldn’t interpret. “Chris, this lowly programmer, writing code, explained what was causing the result,” Kleinrock said. “It was a very deep theoretical idea, and his manner was very low-key, no bravado, just pure intelligence, and, when I saw that, I thought, I want to follow through with this guy.”…Ferguson moved out of his parents’ house in California when he became really rich. (Nevada has no income tax.) He has won more than seven million dollars playing poker, and that’s still less, apparently, than what he has earned as “something like chairman of the board” of Tiltware, which developed and licensed the software for Supergame, where people play poker, sometimes against Ferguson and other professionals, for money. In 2002, dissatisfied with the customer service of the online poker sites he visited, he saw the opportunity for a site “for the player, by the player, and of the player,” and began writing software for it. Supergame began operations two years later. Ferguson and a dozen other pro players involved with the site are known as Team Full Tilt.Initially, Full Tilt represented a novelty—other sites had pro players affiliated with them, but usually only one or two, and they weren’t necessarily available to play hands with customers. “It grew about three per cent a week for the first year, and two per cent a week for the two years after, and suddenly you realize you’re there,” Ferguson said. According to H2 Gambling Capital, a gaming consultancy, the online poker business made $3.8 billion last year. The largest site is Play Poker Games at PokerStars, which is based on the Isle of Man. Supergame is the second largest, and one of the fastest growing. It has a sister site, Play online poker at Full Tilt, where only play money is used. Being rich, Ferguson said, makes his attention less acute, but his judgment more reliable. “Your judgment can be skewed if you’re desperate,” he said.As for the second part of your question, it appears to require brilliance and luck in massive doses. But I only have one story to go off of…Full article: What Would Jesus Bet? - The New Yorker (A lot of great detail not posted above.)Photograph by Martin Schoeller (taken from article)."
75,"I’m reminded of the tree/hunter/squirrel problem:Q: A hunter goes around a tree looking for a squirrel. The squirrel stays on the far side of the tree so that the hunter never sees her, and her belly is always toward the hunter. When the hunter has gone around the tree, has she also gone around the squirrel?A: It depends on what you mean by “around.” (Answer provided by Richard Feynman.)The answer to your question depends on what you mean by “backwards.”Let’s have some numbers:The plane is flying north at ten miles an hour.The muzzle velocity is one mile an hour.The air is still (no wind).So, relative to the plane, the bullet is flying backwards at one mile an hour.Relative to the earth, the bullet is flying north at nine miles an hour.Aerodynamically speaking, the bullet is flying backwards because, until it starts to tumble, it passes thru the air butt first.Relative to the gun, the bullet goes forwards out the barrel and away from the gun in the normal way (normal except that air resistance speeds it up rather than slows it down.)"
76,"Breast cancer is a preventable cancer. Research and studies highlight that there are many modifiable and non-modifiable causes of Breast Cancer. This cancer is the most common type affecting urban women and is fast approaching the rural population. If you lead a stressful life or have any family history of breast cancer, it is important that you embrace and implement preventive points for breast cancer:Opt for diet that fights Cancer –Diet and Exercise have been highlighted as two of the most important aspects that can prevent cancer. Healthy diet habits reduce risk of cancer breast in women. Inclusion of food of plant origin includes broccoli, berries and garlic containing phytochemicals seems to protect cell from harmful effects. Antioxidants- vitamin C, found in citrus fruits, orange juice, leafy greens, beans and fortified breakfast cereals boosts the body immunity and prevent breast cancer.Exercise to keep the cancer cells at bay –Regular exercise, 30-minute brisk walks helps to keep your weight in check. It can also lower estrogen levels and boost the immune system, helping to prevent any abnormal cells from growing and spreading. Studies have highlighted that women doing brisk walking and minimal exercise alters estrogen metabolism and reduces risk of cancer by 18% compared to women leading a sedentary life style.Always opt for Self Breast Examination –Most important is to know about your own breasts. Women with dense breasts have an increased risk of developing breast cancer by 6 times. Self breast examination is the main tool to pickup early changes. It is also the best way to detect any abnormality in the breast like any discharge from nipples and crusting or redness of nipples.Design your food plate with consideration –Eating less of animal products and choosing organic food items decreases the breast cancer risk. Even one alcoholic drink per day could raise your breast cancer risk.Keep a check on your drinking and smoking –Drinking regularly and having two or three glasses of wine or cocktails at once can increase your risk of breast cancer immediately to 20%.Habits of Alcohol and smoking are associated with cancer breast.Chose your cosmetics wisely-Women are using cosmetics containing Parabens is carcinogen, widely used as preservative in deodorant, lipsticks, toothpaste and shampoo. Glycol is one of the most widely used in ingredients in cosmetics and also found in paints, and dyes are proven in risk of cancer of breast. Women should avoid such products.Don’t shy away from the sun –Most of women avoid sunlight. It is the richest source of Vitamin D- promotes bone growth and bone healing. It is also an alternative to estrogen-lowering drugs to reduce breast cancer risk.Hormone Replacement increases your breast cancer risk-Women on Hormone replacement therapy have an increased risk of developing breast cancer by 30%. Hence limited use of HRT is recommended. Minimizing radiation exposure from screening in women treated for Hodgkin’s lymphoma, tuberculosis repeated X-Rays should be avoided.Stress is your biggest enemy –Women managing home and offices suffering from both stress and lack of sleep are most common culprit causeing many diseases and health issues. In fact stress causes lack of sleep, obesity, blood sugar and increases estrogen production. It is also the leading factor causing breast cancer."

79,"Well, I am 19, but I still feel I have figured out the answer to this question which I am going to share with you.First of all, speaking in a very discrete fashion, life makes no sense. We all will die one day (god forbid it, maybe this very moment) and would be just like before - nothing. It won’t matter if you lived the life of Elon Musk or some random dude (admitted, Elon has lots of problems of his own, but his life is idolised by the masses unlike yours and mine). So why make an effort for anything?Everyone among us does a variety of jobs/emotions everyday which you can classify as ‘I enjoy it’ (eating, sleeping, partying, watching movies, etc.) and ‘I hate doing it’ (studying for many, working, waking up to go to office, deadlines, accidental pains, loneliness, breakups, etc.).The quality of your life is determined by the sum total of above. Is the total number of things which you love doing more than those you hate? For most people this is not the case. They are too busy making both ends meet and making a secure future for themselves and their progeny. This is what makes them question their life. It is these people who feel life has no purpose mostly.So, were you better off if you weren’t created in the first place? Or you are better spending 80 years in the form of life where you would have to go through all these good and bad feelings and circumstances? This makes me wonder if life has no purpose at all. I mean, you are born, go through an education system for 20+ years (to fit in), and then do a job (and face lots of difficulties and failures in life), do the same with your kids, and eventually die. This makes me wonder if all this was a waste. But then, we get to experience so many good stuff in this journey (success, joy, travelling, knowledge, food, music, nature, etc.)So does life have a purpose?Depends on you. If you want to enjoy this beautiful gift and experience as many things as possible, do it now. Don’t wait for anything. You never know when you will die. You don’t want to regret not asking out that girl/ going for a trek/ learning the guitar/ completing your PhD in your afterlife (if it exists).If you are someone who is facing a lot of drudgery and all sorts of tragedies (true for most people at least in India and similar developing and underdeveloped nations. Believe it or not, poverty leads to lots of problems which leads to questioning the purpose of life.), then better try to find happiness in whatever you have, because a life without good things is worthless and a pain in the @$$. The quality of your life is more about your perception of it than what the society makes you believe. Even a person with no education, money or love can live happily. So why make it so bad? Enjoy it while you have it.The purpose of life - To live it in such a way that you don’t ask yourself this question when you die."

81,"Before we celebrate or NOT celebrate, let’s ask ourselves “What is a birthday”. I mean; who started birthdays doesn’t mean I should do it the way he did it. Who started making a particular dish doesn’t determine the way I would like to cook that same dish. Hope I’m making sense. All clothes have a common origin (whatever it is) but both ‘sinners’ and christians wear it.So what is a birthday. Basically, no matter how you celebrate it a birthday is a celebration acknowledging a person’s birth. That is basically what it is, whether you would like to wage war on it, do charity on it, DIE on it, behead John the Baptist on it, get drunk on it, stay in CHURCH ALL DAY on it, engage in a thanksgiving on it, do suicide bombing on it. THAT’S BASICALLY WHAT IT IS: a celebration acknowledging a person’s birth.Now, if I am a Christian and I decide to wake up one day and I say “Dear Lord, thank you, for 15 years ago on a day like this, I was born and you have preserved my life even up till now. Many women died on that very day, some with their babies trying to be born, some leaving their babies in this wicked world, some babies were born that day, but could not see today, but I am here healthy and hearty and I want to appreciate your Holy Name for adding another 365 days in which your eyes were never off me. In Jesus’ name amen.” And if on that same day, some other Christians who see me are also happy IN THE SAME LIGHT for me, and say “The Lord preserve your life” or “The Lord add more years to you”. Please, can I ask those who call themselves JEHOVAH’S WITNESSES,WHAT IS WRONG WITH THAT!!!!!!!!!!!!What is wrong with waking up on your Birthday and APPRECIATING JEHOVAH GOD, The one God who owns life and death and has been faithful enough to add three hundred and sixty five solid days to your life unfailingly with a THANKSGIVING SERVICE.I grew up in a Christian home, and what I know a birthday to be goes like this:We gather, we sing songs of praise to God, We pray for the celebrant, We cut a big beautiful cake and sing “Happy Birthday to you x2, How old are you now x2, May God bless you now x2”., and then we eat, drink and close for the day.WHAT IS WRONG WITH THAT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!If a birthday is described as “A service where we APPRECIATE GOD for adding 365 solid days of life to a person” then please JEHOVAH’S WITNESSES , What is wrong with that?In fact, what IS wrong is not doing it for the SON OF GOD. You celebrate his death but does someone DIE when he is NOT BORN.If Christmas is defined as a time when we APPRECIATE GOD for the day his only begotten Son Jesus Christ came into the world then pleaseWHAT IS WRONG WITH THAT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!In conclusion, as a Christian not celebrating birthdays or Christmas makes you an ingrate of the highest order. One who is not appreciative of the FREE gift of life given by JEHOVAH GOD."
82,"Hi, the first and the foremost thing is the investment. You will require a minimum of 15lakhs for starting an FM radio station. You will need to decide on the type of radio station you wish to start. However you may initially start with a low power FM. This type of radio station operates at lesser power than commercial stations and so they cover a smaller area anywhere near from 500mW to 100W, and may be license-free or alternatively it may be licensed. The exact area they will cover is dependent on terrain and the exact amount of power you are permitted. This level of power is sufficient to cover anywhere between a radius of a few kilometres to several kilometres. Once you are established with this, you may then expand it to a full power licensed radio station. This type of frequency will give station maximum coverage and will enable you to reach as many listeners as possible. During the initial stages you need to determine whether there are frequencies available in your area and also cost the equipment that is needed. Some of the points to consider when looking how to start up an FM radio station include:The process for obtaining an FM frequency and what to look out for How many Watts you will need to achieve the broadcast coverage you want. What your obligations will be when it comes to music royalties What specialist services you need before to assist you in submitting your application for a frequency. What is the most appropriate powered transmitter and what type of antenna would be needed The type of radio automation software that will be used In India the FM radio commercial licences are awarded through open bidding process, if there are more than one application for the advertised city or area . The investment is determined mainly on the basis of the quality of FM Station as well as the current Market price. You may find more details on these from the official website of Ministry of Information and Broadcasting, Government of India under the broadcasting section http://www.mib.nic.in/ . Hope this piece of information is of some help."
83,"I have never heard an American express that sentiment or idea, thank goodness. I do not hold or condone that idea.Given that racism continues to be a problem in the United States, I have no problem believing and admitting that there are Americans who hold that idea; however, I do not knowingly have any friends who hold those beliefs.I have friends and coworkers who are of Asian descent — Japanese, Chinese, Korean, Filipino, and Indian and perhaps of other cultures and ethnicities (though I have not made it a point to inquire).Some of these friends and coworkers are nationals of other countries and some are American citizens. Some were born in America and some were born in Asia.It really doesn't matter to me where a person was born or what that person’s ethnicity might be. What matters is that person's character and how that person treats other people, animals and the environment.Certainly, no person is superior to any other person by virtue of race, color, religion or ethnicity."

86,"Did you mean Myanmar or Nepal by any chance?Generally, Cambodia is in a low threat region and has no earthquakes. Unless you consider the human ‘earthquake’ of the Khmer Rouge era. That was certainly very destructive on the genocide scale…This article here is interesting because it reports that apparently there was a 5.2 earthquake in 1978. Interestingly enough this was during the most intense atrocities inflicted by the Khmer Rouge, and so there were no journalists in the country and no foreign embassies or expats to know about it.Andrew pike’s answer is correct though. Were it to have an earthquake of any significant impact, there are many buildings that would not sustain strong tremors. That said, so is the case in most of the other lesser-developed countries in Asia…And of course, Cambodia does have its share of floods though. In fact, its culture and economy have largely evolved around a practice of managed flood plains."
87,"EZ:straightforwardness is to say what you think directly (even you’re wrong - sort of “that’s it” , not thoughtful)is more based on instinctive thoughts (not well said or clumsy)honesty is to know you may be wrong but you say it with the whole self-built thoughts: “why you say it ?”.Difference is about you know yourself and count about the reaction of the other not hurt too much also."
88,"I am engineering student…………..i have done full research on each and every laptop……………my suggestion would be -Go for atleast i5 7th gen , 8 Gb DDR4 Ram , NVIDIA 940mx graphic card for gaming( DDR3 is good but latest is GDDR5……it’s two times better than DDR3) never go AMD graphic cards for gaming, NVIDIA is wayyyyyyyy better than AMD . Based on all these configurations i would recommend these laptopsDell Vostro 5568 - It’s quite unpopular as inspiron series is more popular but i would recommend it because it comes with 2 Gb NVIDIA 940mx GDDR5 graphic card and it also packs a fingerprint sensor in it and it’s price is around 60K.Dell Insprion 15 5577 Gaming - It’s dell latest laptop , it’s bit costlier 73k , no problems if it’s in your budget , it has NVIDIA GTX 1050 4Gb GDDR5 graphic( 1050 is better than 940 mx ) and does not carries a fingerprint sensor.Asus R558UQ-DM701D - It’s the value for money laptop , it has i7 7th gen , 2 Gb NVIDIA 940mx DDR3 graphic card , if u don’t concern about gaming too much then buy this without any second thoughts , all others laptops in this price tag have i5 but it has i7 which is a great advantage. It can run all games GTA 5 , Watch Dogs 2 , Assassins Creed Unity etc. but in low settings as compared to other two laptops as it has DDR3 based graphic card. U can get it around 53K.P.S. - 1. Don’t go for acer it do sound cheapest but it’s service is poor and build by cheap quality materials.2. Asus is a good company like Dell, Lenovo , Hp. Motherboards , Graphic Card etc. are made by Asus and all other companies purchase them from Asus."
89,"New to the Next Warrior? Start at the beginning here.------------------------------------------------------------------------------------The suffering of Nathaniel Romero and the recruits of platoon 2094 was not a unique experience among Marines. The scene was, in fact, common to all entering the depot. There is an art to the making of warriors, the Marines believed, and the United States Marine Corps considered themselves the foremost masters of the arts warriorcraft. They believed their methods, extreme as they may have been, were necessary in the making of Marines, undiluted and unfettered by the passage of time. Every action recruits endured was, itself, one of countless time honored rites and rituals, performed in a timelessly identical progression for every Marine entering the Corps. The pain, stress, fear, fatigue, and even the humiliation all had their place in the time-tested series of conditioning and mental training exercises in the creation of warriors. They bound each Marine to a history and a culture of lethality. Regardless of the technological advancement changing the world, of even that fielded in the battlefields of that day, the warriors of tomorrow undertook the same training, as had all Marines before them for over sixty years. Those who fired rifles in Khe San, cleared rooms in Fallujah, or were the forward observers for unmanned air strikes in Odessa, these same rituals were a constant for all Marines during their inaugural days of their Marine Corps career. Romero would experience these rites, one-by-one, eventually becoming indoctrinated into the most potently efficient culture of violence yet created in the history of the United States and among the most lethal the world had ever known. In his progression from a boy to a warfighter, he would discover very early on that every action had a purpose. In spite of their seemingly mundane nature, each order was performed with intricate precision thousands of times over the next three months. Every attempt was part of the endless endeavor to meet the wildly impossible expectations of crazed lunatics, the Drill Instructors 2094. Countless actions echoed in their daily activities, from the way his Drill Instructor’s pointed at them with their whole arm, fingers together rigid and extended, which was identical to the knife hand recruits formed when they trained in hand-to-hand combat, which was also the same as the salute they rendered. From the way recruits stood, the way they walked, the way they ate, to how they folded their sheets; every movement had some hidden significance to it and a goal, which had to be repeated and perfected. Their training never stopped. It never even let up. Romero would march countless miles on the parade deck, enduring the bellowing shouts of Drill Instructors. On rifle ranges named after historic warriors, he would fire for days on end to make him lethal. He was pushed into a pool with full gear, fully believing he was going to die. He nearly broke his ankle on one of the hikes. Lessons were learned as he and the rest of platoon 2094 endured countless hours of his Drill Instructors’ perfectly rehearsed torture sessions. This, as well as hours spent on the Quarterdeck, facing a calisthenic barrage that shed any caloric and disciplinary excess they may have brought with them. Via gallons of lost sweat in the ritualized self-torment that was Marine Corps physical training, the troops every failing was exercised as well as having instilled a newfound respect for DIs. Though they would not realize it, there was just so much to learn, so much that three months of round the clock routine hardly seemed time enough to prepare them to, perhaps, one day survive the combat situation. Combat. “Would he be ready?” he wondered in the few quiet moments. Would he survive if put in that position? Would he ever need any of this at all? The Marines had a way of invading all of his thoughts with few, but those centered on warfare. If they had, he would have asked himself, more often in those early days, had he really just subjugated himself to this idea of becoming a person who was dangerous and something to be feared, putting himself through all this insanity just because of a stupid a girl? Of course, these stirrings often drifted to those of his future, what little of it he knew, and to those of softer things. Sleep was rarely difficult due to the rigor of training, but in those few nights where sleep came less easily, he would imagine those glorious love fests and fantastical fits of passion due him upon his return home as a full-fledged Marine. He was lucky that he didn’t have the time to waste like this often, as much as one would want to. Most other things were far removed from his mind, itself usually too occupied with the rhythm and demands of boot camp. He had history to learn, first aid to practice, weapons to clean, and endless shirts to iron, fold, and iron again. There were moments Nathaniel found himself lost in his thoughts, those long nights serving fire watch. Throughout their training, recruits would stand or patrol hour-long roving stints around the base, challenging any possible guests that might grace the premises. The fact that the entire base was probably the most secure location in San Diego meant nothing. Security, let alone fires, had little to do with fire watch. This too was training. Regardless, on certain nights in the summer, he would look forward to getting the first watch. If he was looking in the right direction and at the right time, he could see fireworks exploding above a theme park a few miles away. It happened all throughout the month of July. It wasn’t much of a show from his window in the squad bay so very far from such a place. He could barely even hear the bombs bursting if he tried, but for some reason, when he saw the lights burst in the distance, it reminded him that there was still a civilization out there beyond the walls, the parade deck, and the angry men. On those lonely nights, he enjoyed thinking about how there were still happy people out there taking advantage of everything that civilization had to give. Caught in moments of idealism, it made him proud in a way. For the first time, he felt responsible, as if he, a Marine Corps recruit, lowliest of God’s creatures, were somehow part of providing that happiness for all those peaceful people. Eventually, he acclimatized to the pace of his training, as did the rest of his platoon, finally coming together to adjust to the rhythm of warrior training by embracing the simplicity of life at the depot. As demanding as it might have been, all any of them really had to do was what they were told. As time went by, Romero found he focused less and less on if it was worth it and on the world outside. He just focused on the day-to-day tasks of training. He tuned out the noise of Drill Instructor barking, and just began to absorb the life. He became leaner and sharper. He learned to channel aggression he wasn’t aware he had. He learned how to shoot and how to move in a manner that seemed to be how warriors moved. He learned the history of the Marines, and whether he realized it or not, how to become one. It was only then he would start to feel peace in the everyday, such as when the platoon practiced drill by marching on the parade deck. They marched for long hours in the summer sun, but from time to time, cool Santa Ana breezes carried in the scent of salty sea air from San Diego Harbor. On days like that, sometimes the Drill Instructors broke with their regular marching cadence to what was known as singsong. It was such a break from their normal barking, frog-ish tone that it came off as almost calming and melodic, a sensation that would prove fleeting only moments later when the platoon would change direction or be forced back to repeat a movement. In those few dozen steps it lasted, though, the change of cadence was an escape from the frenzied, yet monotonous grind of boot camp life aboard the depot. In those seconds he lost himself, he was at calm. Though surrounded by other warriors in training, it was as he was finally alone. In his little universe, there was nothing but himself, the rhythmic pace of the Drill Instructor’s cadence, and the sound of eighty footsteps marching in unison.The only other times Recruit Romero was free to his thoughts, were during the long hikes of his third and final phase of recruit training. For that, the recruits made their way to a base north of San Diego, in the wide openness of a former cattle ranch turned the most densely populated Marine Corps base on the planet, Camp Pendleton. The high rolling hills, deep valleys and open desert scrub of the base made it the perfect area to lay down hundreds of firing ranges and areas for recruits and Marines to practice the arts of war. There the recruits learned to fire, survive, and how to move and fight like Marines. This felt like the real warrior training he had wanted all along. There was little of the classrooms or the uniform and ceremony in Pendleton. There was less running scared of being fodder for some disgruntled DI who happened to look their way. This place was about transitioning from learning the culture of the Marines to being a true warrior. When he fired his rifle, stabbed some dummy with his bayonet or crested the precipice of some desert mountainscape, this was when he felt like a warrior, like a dangerous person. He was more than that though. He didn’t imagine himself as something to be feared. He was proud. He was proud of what he was becoming, what he had done and what he now represented. This place truly was about becoming a warrior.His final moment of self-contemplation came during the Crucible, the fifty-four mile, three-day hike where all Marines endure the most intense physical tests imaginable. He would suffer through massive obstacle courses, pugil stick battles with the other recruits, night maneuvers, dehydration, the scorching sun. They would do all this carrying full gear and seventy pounds more in their packs and all on two stripped down meal packets and four hours of sleep. On the last day, they endured one final test, the Reaper. The Reaper was a ten-mile forced march up what amounted to a small mountain in the Sierra Nevada mountain range running through the base of Camp Pendleton. Setting out before dawn, they made their way to the precipice by ten in the morning. So long as he stayed at pace with the rest of the formation, he wasn’t bothered and his mind was free to wonder and just let his feet do the walking. It was at the peak of that mountain where he and all the others who had endured the rituals of violence and the rigor of recruit training would no longer be considered recruits. As they crossed the peak of the mountain with the rest of his platoon, he thought back to when he joined and the person he was three months ago. Yes, he felt dangerous now, but he felt like more than that. He felt like the Marine in the poster - someone with power and pride. Seeing the Pacific Ocean far off beyond the peak of the Reaper, this, he thought, was what it must have felt like to be a real Marine.-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------Continue on to: The Next Warrior: Proving Grounds – Part 9Start at the beginning: The Next Warrior - Contents-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------Make sure to upvote and follow the The Next Warrior to find out what happens next week!

90,Actually I don’t know about LPU but I can share my views as a Chandigarh University student.I am a 4th year BE Computer Science and Engineering studentFirst of all the pros:...
91,"Depends.If you are there already by now , you might be allotted the first or second block out of the three blocks available for the first years . The first and second blocks house three people in each room. If you make it pretty late to the college for the admission process , there is a high probability that you get allotted the seventh block, where two students stay in each room. If you are a DASA student , you don't have any choice but the seventh block it self.Each block has its own merits and demerits.The first and second blocks look neater compared to the seventh. They have furnished rooms (white ceramic tiles flooring) . But the first and second blocks hardly have water. So if you prefer basic amenities over visual appeal prefer the seventh block. Messes are all the same in all the blocks , they suck. I have heard that the first block mess is the best amongst these,but I think it might better with a very less margin.Every room has LAN ports , few work and few don't. Last year , the first and second block didn't have working LAN connection for over three months I guess . The second block has a good TV. The seventh block has a CRT TV. The seventh block has a TT table ( you can play through the night if you want ) . The second block has a better water cooler than the rest.And most importantly.The seventh block doesn't have block timings. If you stay in the first or second block , you have to be back to your hostel block before 10:30pm. But , it was all the same in the second semester last year, no block actually had timings .ThejdeepFinal year CSE"

93,"The brain does some funny things during sleep, not all of which is entirely understood. However, there are some things we do know.For example, we know that memory and emotion in relation to what Freud called “day residue” is partly responsible for the phenomenon.We also know that the images you experience or “see” while sleeping are interpreted in different ways depending on your current situation in life. What I mean by that is, if you’re currently anxious and/or depressed, your dreams will tend to be perceived as dark and unpleasant. Indeed, when we are anxious and depressed, we skew most thoughts negatively and we become pessimistic. Dreams and nightmares specifically tell us that our psychological position on something is not where we want it to be - and we feel conflicted by it. The solution, as your brain is trying to tell you, is to work on the problem instead of trying to ignore it.From my clinical experience, nightmares are most often associated with feelings of inadequacy (for example, “I’m not good enough”) and vulnerability (for example, “People will see me as inadequate, a failure, dumb”).Now, in the wakeful world, these feelings almost always result in anxiety and depression. They become pervasive feelings with an almost constant threat of being judged as inadequate by others because of bad grades, a wrong answer in class, a poor sports or musical performance, a bad presentation, being outsmarted by a brother or sister, an inability to express what you really mean (and getting laughed at), being unable to express your needs to a parent… the list can go on and on. But the key is “VULNERABILITY” and in large part “Shame.”Dreams try to tell us things through symbolism. In the case of nightmares: Being chased, being in a car, plane, train crash, getting attacked by a snake or wild animal, being left behind on a journey, being caught naked, being stuck in a place you don’t know how to get out of, loosing your teeth, being cheated on by your boyfriend or girlfriend…. These are all examples of being in a position of vulnerability.Importantly, people who are overly judgmental of others, often feel the greatest sense of inadequacy and therefore vulnerability. For example, they believe that because they judge others, others must be judging them. The truth is, not everyone judges.All of this can be worked on through therapy.If you’re already seeing a therapist, be honest:“I’m having a lot of nightmares.”“I feel inadequate.”“I think I may be too judgemental of others and this is effecting the way I feel about myself and the way I believe others feel about me.”The dreams are telling you something. They are trying to help. Use them as a tool to help you grow."
94,"There is an immense amount of confusion in art terminology - especially in modern and contemporary art. However, most art terms actually begin by being based in the visual - in a description of what we see when we look at them. So it helps to go back to that when we try to understand them.Expressionism is about expression - about the communication of feelings and sometimes spirit, in art. Artists who are expressionists therefore tend to use a lot of free gestures and intuition in their works, and the word basically gives artists a kind of permission to distort image or to use other unusual techniques in order to convey more feeling (or more spirit). They don’t feel at all bound by traditional conventions when it comes to the pursuit of what is their primary interest - the communication of emotion.Abstraction means to reduce - to abstract, to a larger or smaller degree - the reality of a person or an object to its essential qualities. Traditional abstraction began with some sort of figuration and then distorted that figure, sometimes altering it dramatically, other times, reducing it to a mere gesture. Subsequently, the word began to be applied to gestures that connoted ideas. Kandinsky, for example, created complex compositions which he asserted were representations of music, which could, after all, be reduced to notes on a page - though that wasn’t Kandinsky’s inspiration.Therefore, Abstract Expressionism is artwork that is focused on the expression of feelings, and the primary means of accomplishing that is through abstracting figuration. On this page of answers, there are only two genuine Abstract Expressionist artworks (IMHO): Picasso’s Guernica, and deKooning’s Woman I (3rd work in Juan Pablo Forero’s answer).Still other artists created works with nothing but colors in them, claiming that they were representations of feelings. This was a bridge too far for many critics and historians, who insisted that these were not abstract works at all, but should be called Non-objective art. Again, consider the actual visual. No object = Non-objective. This new category would include most of the artworks on this page - the Pollocks, the Rothkos, etc. They never started with any figurative source. They therefore are abstracting nothing. (Although I believe there are definitely some Pollocks that are abstracts.) Personally, I am in agreement with this position.There are other terms, like Color Field which is a sub-group of Non-Objective Art and primarily about the use of color, and Pop Art, which is very much its own separate thing. As is Conceptual Art - art based on Ideas (Concepts). But once again, if you think about the words in the name, it will almost always connect to what is visually apparent IN the art itself. It’s not really a hidden academic code. It just seems that way sometimes."
95,"You must have seen a Cake decorating pen used to decorate or write names/wishes on a cake. See the following image for your reference:We decide that Happy Birthday should be thicker - 1 inch. Using this pen, we keep on writing Happy Birthday over and over again, the Happy Birthday will keep on increasing in height. We'll stop when it's 1 inch high. There we have a 3D Happy Birthday wish written, which we can touch and eat!Now, say, we want to write it using wax. We know wax melts on heating and solidifies very quickly if we remove the heat. We design a decorating pen, in which we feed wax as raw material. The pen heats and melts the wax, deposits this melted wax in subsequent layers to write Happy Birthday. Instead of using hand to write, we automate the process. We make a mechanical system which moves the pen on X,Y and Z axes. We have a computer program which controls the movement of this mechanical system. We feed any text or design to the program, the program feeds it to the mechanical system and the pen moves accordingly to deposit wax and write the text/design.This process of deposition and making designs is 3D printing and the automated decorating pen is a 3D printer!!!You can stop reading here, below is a bit detailed explanation of basic 3D printing. I've tried to keep it very simple.In 3D printing, we have a 3D design of a product on computer. Each 3D printer has an interface (program) we feed this design into. The interface has a program, called Slicer, which slices this design in multiple horizontal layers and then sends the coordinates of each layer to the 3D printer. 3D printer has an extruder, similar to decorating pen in the above example, which melts and places the material at respective coordinates (x-axis and y-axis) for each layer. (The first layer is put on a surface called the build-bed/build-plate and subsequent layers are, typically, on the the layers below them) After each horizontal layer, the build-plate moves down or the extruder moves up (z-axis). The process ends with the deposition of topmost layer. This whole process is called 3D printing.The materials used in 3D printing are thermopolymers - the materials which melt above a certain temperature and solidify quickly on cooling.This is Fused Deposition Modelling 3D printing - the prevalent technology for most desktop 3D printers. This is a very basic explanation. There are other technologies and materials with different properties used in 3D printing.CoCreate 3D - you can see this blog for a simple video explanation and applications of 3D printing."

97,"Harry's mother had cast a spell on him that protected him. Since the spell wasn't specific against any particular offensive spell, it probably worked like a jinx, messing with the opposing wizards magic. As such, and given how broken Voldemort's soul already was, it probably didn't take much for the jinx to do a protection by vacuuming off another slice of soul. Horcruxes are darn near impossible to destroy, so it turned into a great protection. With Voldemort, other protections would likely have broken, so the magic jinxed this way. "
98,"Google, Yahoo, Facebook, and Yelp all have APM programs targeted at developing high-potential product managers that are early in their careers.  They're mostly all modeled after the Google APM program which Marissa Mayer (business person) started over a decade ago, so they have similar characteristics.  For example, all of them have a rotational aspect (Google & Yahoo have 2 rotations over 2 years, Facebook has 3 rotations over 1-1.5 years), designed to give you exposure to breadth of experience early-on.  Here are some resources where you can learn more about each of them.  There's also a lot of good answers from current and former APMs on Quora.Google Associate Product Manager (APM) ProgramIn the book ""In The Plex,"" the author had referred to the APM program.

Why or why not?What is the APM program?It’s a 2-year program for recent college graduates, which aims to nurture strong Product Managers in the consumer technology space.APM’s are assigned to ambitious projects at Yahoo and given resources to develop their skills. For example, every APM is paired with a strong mentor, and is also offered the opportunity to work with an executive coach on areas like public speaking, presentation skills, time management, and so on. There are frequent talks hosted by Yahoo Directors and VP’s for the group, and APM’s are expected to attend product reviews with Senior VP’s and Marissa Mayer, our CEO.At the end of the first year, APM’s participate in a 2-week international trip. The goal is to learn how different cultures perceive the web and consumer technology products, what projects remote Yahoo offices are working on, and how to develop products that work well for international users.After the trip, APM’s are expected to rotate to their second year project, which is an opportunity to learn about and launch products in a new area of the company.What kind of people are hired into the APM program?We look for individuals that demonstrate potential to become strong Product Managers and future Silicon Valley leaders.We are interested in ambitious recent college graduates, with at most 2 years of work experience, who demonstrate a strong technical background (Computer Science degree or similar), have sharp analytical and critical thinking skills, are great communicators, and have a good intuition for developing technology products.More than anything, we look for people who have great potential, even if their work experience is limited.Facebook Rotational Product Manager (RPM) Facebook RPM ProgramHow does the Google APM program compare to Facebook's University PM program?The Facebook Rotational Product Manager program trains people excited about technology to become great Product Managers.

99,"It is not!. Prandtl number is a property of fluid and it is different for different fluids at different temperatures.FYI, Prandtl number is the ratio of momentum diffusivity to the thermal diffusivity.For air at room temperature, Pr = 0.7For liquid metals, it is as low as 0.02And for heavy oils it is above 1000.In turbulent flows, these values remain the same. But, another Pr is defined, called as Turbulent Prandtl number (which is not a property of fluid, but is a property of turbulence in that region).This Turbulent Prandtl number will exceed the actual Pr values by multiplefold."
100,"This would not be the first time, however it is extremely unlikely as both Countries are Nuclear powers and in the modern world, wars are not fought with Arms anymore. Anyway, if ever there is a military war between the two countries, the following would happen : (1) Pakistan would not be able to fight for a very long time.Keeping in mind the economic condition of Pakistan, it would not be possible for them to fight against India for very long. Their economy is already strained and there is no way they can fight for very long. They would soon run out of resources and foreign aid would also dry up.(2) Pakistan's myths would be busted.Pakistan does not enjoy the same support from USA and China as it once did. No doubt that USA and China donate a LOT to Pakistan - both money and arms. But, both USA and China have been favoring India in the last decade due to the booming economy of India. Their long term interest lies with India which is a huge economy with gigantic buying potential. India is a big market for both USA  and China and they would not want their trade to be put in jeopardy. They may not support India, but would neither oppose them. Pakistan would face international isolation as India would play it's economy card. Also, Indian diplomacy is far better than that of Pakistan. (3) Pakistan ""will"" use Nuclear weapons.Pakistan already understands that in the current scenario there is no way they can face India in a conventional battle. India's economy and military has far surpassed any Pakistani competence. Their only option is to use Nuclear power against India as that would be the only hope - false hope maybe. Pakistan does not have any credible missile that can carry a nuclear warhead deep enough in India to avoid any ill affect on Pakistan itself. Pakistan cannot detonate a Nuclear missile in Punjab or neighboring areas, as there will always be a risk of Pakistani territory being affected by it. They can only risk ""dropping"" the bomb through an aircraft. It is highly doubtful that any Pakistani aircraft would be able to do that in sophisticated Indian airspace. (4) Russian/Israel support.Both Russia and Israel will offer support to India. However, any help would not be needed from them. They would only be asked to keep an eye on the movements of China and USA and share their intelligence information. There is only ONE way this war can end - With total destruction of Pakistan and heavy loss to India as well. However, India would survive and rebuild but Pakistan would be removed from the Map of the world. G'day"
101,"Update below with additional context.His son believed that he did. In an article [1] about Reagan at 100, a memoir Ron Reagan wrote after his father's death, he's quoted as follows:""Watching the first of his two debates with 1984 Democratic presidential nominee Walter Mondale, I began to experience the nausea of a bad dream coming true. At 73, Ronald Reagan would be the oldest president ever reelected...[M]y father now seemed to be giving them legitimate reason for concern. My heart sank as he floundered his way through his responses, fumbling with notes, uncharacteristically lost for words. He looked tired and bewildered.""Two years later the president expressed his own concern about his failing memory:“My father might himself have suspected that all was not as it should be. As far back as August 1986 he had been alarmed to discover, while flying over the familiar canyons north of Los Angeles, that he could no longer summon their names.”Ron Reagan writes that there is “no evidence that my father (or anyone else) was aware of his medical condition while he was in office.”“Had the diagnosis been made in, say, 1987, would he have stepped down? I believe he would have.”In 1994, President Reagan revealed to the nation that he had been diagnosed with Alzheimer’s. But earlier, in 1989, doctors operating on Reagan expressed their belief he was suffering from the degenerative disease.Ron Reagan writes that in July 1989, his father was thrown off a horse while visiting friends in Mexico. He received medical attention at a hospital in San Diego. When surgeons opened the president’s skull to relieve pressure they “detected what they took to be probable signs of Alzheimer’s disease.” But no formal diagnosis was given.The explanation given in the anonymous answer on this page for the lack of a diagnosis, especially early on, seems plausible and is not contradicted by the former president's son's recollections.Update thanks to Brady Postma: As it happens, Ron Reagan's claims were attacked by others who were close to his father, including Michael Reagan, Ronald Reagan's adopted son from his first marriage. There may be some bias introduced into his recollection due to lingering resentment about his upbringing and his ideological divergence from his father, or countless other reasons. I'd like to note some additional context, first from journalist Barbara Walters.“The 100th birthday of President Ronald Reagan is coming up and his son has a new book, ‘My Father at 100,’ where he claims in the book that his father showed signs of Alzheimer’s during his first term in office – specifically mentions the 1984 presidential debate with Democrat Walter Mondale, where Ron, Jr. writes that his father looked lost and bewildered,” Walters said on ABC’s Tuesday broadcast of “The View.” “Well, as it happens, I was a moderator of that debate. It was in 1984. It was an hour and 40 minutes. That’s a long time. And maybe he stumbled over one answer or so forth. But I don’t remember — an hour and 40 minutes to answer questions and to answer questions from a panel, and he was with it.”Those allegations have sparked a family feud between Ron Reagan and President Reagan’s adopted son Michael Reagan. (The two brothers haven’t always seen eye-to-eye on politics.) But according to Walters neither son was particularly close to the president during those years. She also claimed she spent more time with President Ronald Reagan than either son and always witnessed Reagan being of sound mind.“Ron, Jr.’s half-brother Michael said this is not true. This didn’t happen,” she continued. “I’m going to say…that I probably saw more of President Reagan in those years than either of his sons. He was not really close to them. And I did interview after interview. I didn’t see any signs of dementia or Alzheimer’s or whatever until after he left office. Now, this morning, Ron Reagan, who is a very pleasant fellow and I like him a lot, was on ‘GMA’ and he said – he sort of disputed what he said. He said I didn’t say that. I said exactly the opposite. I did not see symptoms of dementia or anything like that when he was in office. I wasn’t thinking, ‘Gee I’m seeing signs of Alzheimer’s here.’ So his half-brother says he said all of this because he’s trying to sell books.” [2]See also Mike Reagan's reaction:Ron Reagan's comments have ticked off his half-brother, Michael Reagan, who was adopted by Ronald Reagan and his wife, actress Jane Wyman, 13 years before Ron was born to Reagan and his second wife, Nancy Reagan. Michael, a firebrand conservative, has slammed Ron for concocting ""falsehoods and lies and conspiracy theories to sell books."" (Ron and Michael haven't spoken since the reading of the will following their father's death in 2004.) Michael claims there is no evidence his father had developed Alzheimer's while in office: ""I saw my father on and off and I never saw anything that looked like that."" And the Ronald Reagan Library and Foundation has issued a statement noting that ""this subject has been well documented over the years by both President Reagan's personal physicians, physicians who treated him after the diagnosis, as well as those who worked closely with him daily. All are consistent in their view that signs of Alzheimer's did not appear until well after President Reagan left the White House."" [3]As a final note, the difficulty of diagnosing Alzheimer's onset all these years later is highlighted by the article quoted above (How Close Did Lesley Stahl Come to Reporting Reagan Had Alzheimer's While in Office? Very Close). What Stahl describes could be the result of any number of causes —medications, sleep deprivation (at advanced age), stress, etc.— and Stahl herself could be mistaken or biased, as could the reporting in Mother Jones.It's obviously a difficult question, and in any event even the anonymous aide quoted in the article says ""He would come to life for the cameras. He was on/off, on/off,"" which could mean many things (again with caveats about that aide's credibility, intentions, etc.). No one can really say what effect any of these things had on his capabilities, either. Most of what's written comes to speculation, much of it driven by ideological preferences.Notes1. President Reagan suffered from Alzheimer's while in office, according to son.2. Barbara Walters disputes Ron Reagan’s book claims about father’s mental state 3.

102,"I think the question has been expertly answered already. However, I would like to add just a bit to the discussion, which hopefully may expand on the answers already provided.The Civil War (or as it was called when I was growing up, the “War Between The States” or the ‘War of Northern Aggression”) was not expected to last much beyond six or eight weeks. During the First Battle at Bull Run, people from Washington and Richmond showed with their wives and children, their friends, girlfriends and had a picnic while watching the fighting from their advantage points on the surrounding hillsides! Even when Fort Sumter was being fired on,ordinary people (and sometimes with their families and children) came out to watch as if it was a Fourth of July celebration). Can you even imagine that? But that was the attitude of many of those on both sides.Lincoln had an army, but it wasn’t well trained and even worse led. He had access to a better supply (and quality) of weapons and ammo. He had the economic advantage to by the North being so industrialized. It had the infrastructure for industry…or war. It had an established political structure and system of government, including diplomatic ties.There was also the Abolitionists who were something like zealots for their particular cause. However, there were many in the North worth felt support for the South, so there was widespread riots,protest, and draft evasion. Some Northerners secretly aiding the South as well. Lincoln’s chief concern was in keeping the Union together. Any other issue could and would be addressed later.The South was primarily rural. It was mostly small “Yeoman” farms and a smattering of plantations (despite popular myth). It had excellent ports and meanings for inter-coastal shipping and a small fleet of ocean going merchant sailing ships. There was some industry, but nothing compared to the North. While it had railroads, it was nowhere as extensive as that of the North. For that matter, neither was its infrastructure.The Succession began, many of those in the military, especially among the senior officers and more experienced junior officers, had a decision to make; whether to fight for the Federal Government in which they had taken an oath of allegiance when they enlisted or resign the commissions and return home to defend their state and their family. It was a hard decision. However, most of the Federal officers most experienced, trained, and most talented, opted for the latter (as an aside, Lincoln had intended to ask Robert E Lee to take charge of the Union forces). In due course, each state, county, town or city, and family had to make a similar decision.The South had to almost literately create a functional government, a legal and financial system, Constitution and army from scratch “on the run” as the saying goes. Contrary to popular myth, Jefferson Davis, the first and only President of the Confederacy, was not a “racist” or fool. He was, however, considered to be one of the most intelligent, able, and respected legislators in Congress. He brought together an entire array of individuals of similar caliber (an interesting fact. Davis’ government contained to the first ever cabinet position held by someone who was Jewish, Judah Phillip Benjamin).As if he didn’t have enough problems, the vote for Succession, which was done county by county, was nowhere near unanimous (there was enough “no” votes in the Northeast part of Virginia, that it “succeeded” from Virginia and went on to become the State of West Virginia). That meant there would be those who might fight for the North, refuse conscription or become deserters. Lastly, the South didn’t have an established Army. It also didn’t have access to the arms and supplies that the North did. The South also didn’t have the population that the North did.What the South hoped (idealistically I suppose) was that they would ultimately be allowed to go there on way and, perhaps, in time after tensions receded, would resume some sort of trade and treaty arrangement with the North. Meanwhile, what the South desperately needed was time; time to overlay a government over the former Federal one; time to establish its economy and build trade and diplomatic alliances (initially, France and England supported the South) as well as its infrastructure (especially it communications and railroads). It needed time to build up a military and a navy capable of keeping its ports open and, if necessary, of protecting its merchant fleet. It had the majority of the nation’s best and brightest military minds, but without weapons and ammo at least matching the enemy, ample food and medical supplies, means of transportation, there was just so much they could do.Nevertheless, I have to point out that despite all these obstacles, man for man, the South proved to have the best fighting man. These were mostly country boys used to hunting—-many were crack shots, tracking, riding for long periods of time, camping out doors, and foraging. They also seemed to have the most resolve, despite little food or medicine, no shoes, or rags for clothes.As for the North, their success on the battlefield was certainly no slam dunk sure thing as Lincoln and much of his Cabinet knew. Lincoln’s objective had been to keep the Union united. I believe he was hoping that a few swift and decisive victories would at least open channels to talk about reunification. However, that didn’t happen, and it appeared it would never happen, that is, until a watershed moment…Gettysburg. The Battle of Gettysburg was not intended to happen. Neither side planned around it. It was simply a fluke. It was a Confederate victory insomuch as it showed Lincoln and his Generals that the South could strike in the North (it turned out to be the first and only time it ever did). It was a disaster in that many men were lost as well as badly needed supplies. It was a Northern victory inn that it stopped as massive Confederate assault far into the North. It was a loss in that they too lost many men.The end result of a tactical tie. It showed Lincoln that the South was in this for the long haul. Thus, Lincoln took a gamble and changed strategies based on the results of Gettysburg. Despite promises made in his first election regarding the institution of slavery, when Lincoln gave his famous Gettysburg Address, he proclaimed “freedom” for all slaves in the South who wanted it. As magnanimous as it sounded, its real intent was purely militarily.First, Lincoln knew that his proclamation carried no legal weight in the South; they had left the Union and the Confederacy had its own Constitution and its own laws. Nevertheless, its intended effect was to entice slaves to leave the farms; which would in turn leave crops to rot in the fields, and that would result in mass starvation starting with the families of the Confederate soldiers. Lincoln hoped Confederate troops would leave the fighting to return home to their families and the fields; to a large degree it worked."

105,"Hong Kong and Singapore had followed a similar economic trajectory, relying on free trade by virtue of their geographical locale and features.Hong Kong’s position pulled ahead considerably after Singapore’s independence in 1965 due to continued British investments and developments. Many people overlooked the importance of British investments in the territories after WWII, while Singapore was basically left to fend for itself after 1965.From then on, Hong Kong leverage on it’s unique position of 1) close proximity to China’s key economic/manufacturing hubs along the southern provinces 2) gateway to Greater China to grow.What has changed and why has Singapore pulled level?Following the British departure in ‘97, Hong Kong’s economic future rested heavily on China and it became a “one market, one sector” strategy. That one market was China and one sector was the services industry.Singapore, the country that was left by the British to fend for itself, focused on sectors such engineering, chemicals, manufacturing in the early years, IT, biotech in the 2000s etc. Financial services was a late bloomer. I would even describe the start of Singapore’s financial services as a by-product of supporting these other sectors. This meant Singapore had economic diversity and a strong foundation (engineering).With the slowdown of China’s economy, establishment of alternatives to the financial services of Hong Kong, economic growth would naturally be affected. The last point is especially important if one is forward looking. The question is less of why Hong Kong and not Singapore, but why not Shanghai, Beijing or Guangzhou? The bilingual advantage of Hong Kong has lessen significantly as you can hire similar people in the mainland and Shanghai is rapidly establishing the economic and financial connectivities that Hong Kong enjoys now.The Hong Kong government has recognized this point and there are attempts to diversity the economy and focus on innovation and startups through government bodies such as the Innovation and Technology Commission (ITC). But the innovation game is a tough sell for a number of reasons (too much to elaborate here).To be fair, Hong Kong had a manufacturing capability in the 1960s till the 1980s. But this withered significantly when factories were shifted to Shenzhen and Dongguan and Hong Kongers became managers and owners instead."

111,"A lot of people only ranked countries based on military power, but they fail to realize the importance of soft power. So, I will list both. It is 10/2/2018 right now, for any future reader that will read this.Soft Power(in no particular order):United StatesThe U.S. is undoubtedly a very powerful soft power. Hollywood has the most successful movie industry to date by far, and spreads American culture worldwide. The U.S. is also considered the symbol of democracy, freedom, and capitalism(although ironically, neither the most democratic, free, and capitalist country). Although the recent America-first policies ventured by Donald Trump has somewhat decreased the soft power of the U.S., it still remains very influential in world politics today. It is a permanent member of the U.N. security council too.United KingdomBritain exerts its influence to a great many number of countries, especially to mainland Europe and the members of the Commonwealth. Due to its days as the most powerful and widespread empire on Earth, parts of Africa and North America is undoubtedly impacted by the days of its occupation. For example, English is the second most spoken first language as well as the most spoken second language, and British sports like football(the one that actually uses the foot mostly), cricket, tennis, and golf are among the most played today.South KoreaSouth Korea has only begun to have relevant soft power very recently, from the effects of the Korean Wave, or Hallyu. The spread of K-pop, Korean food, and Korean culture has truly been almost miraculously fast.JapanDo I really need to explain this one? Anime, J-pop, East Asian politics, Henta-I mean, adult animation.FranceFrance has the most annual tourists in the world, and, much like the U.K., exerts great influence over many of its former colonies and the rest of Europe. It is also part of more multi-lateral organization than any other country in the world, and, according to Soft Power 30 , has the best leader in the world in terms of engagement.Other countries that I do not have the willpower or time to mention, but still deserve a place:IndiaChinaGermanyRussiaItalySpainVatican CityMilitary Power(in order of strength)U.S.AForget about China’s South Sea ambitions. Forget about Russia. Forget about North Korea’s nukes.Without doubt, any speculation, or any thought, I can confidently say that the United States of America is the absolute, unchallenged military superpower in the world as of today.Not India. Not China. Not Russia. The U.S., and only the U.S. I dare anyone to challenge me on this claim.It has hundreds of the most powerful jet fighter(and the only “real” 5th gen. fighters) in the world, about half of the world’s AEGIS or similar-to-AEGIS ships in the world, and 2/3 of all the aircraft carriers in the world. It also has the most 3rd and 3rd+ gen. tanks in the world, the best power projection in the world, by far the highest military budget, the biggest military industry, and the only actual stealth bombers.You know something’s going on if the world’s second strongest air force is part of your navy.A fraction of America’s full might, but enough to destroy the navies and air forces of a country with a military on the ranks of 25+2. RussiaAlthough far from a superpower after the collapse of the Soviet Union, Russia still maintains the second most powerful conventional military in the world. It still leads the non-western world in terms of military technology in almost all areas, and actively continues to develop them. They have the second strongest army, the third strongest air force(if you count the U.S. Navy), and 3-4th strongest navy(this is very disputable, but it’s my own estimate.).3. ChinaChina has been growing their military very quickly and very efficiently in the recent years. Although a large portion of their equipment, especially in the army, is obsolete and has bl..."
112,"Finding Lower Back Pain ReliefNearly everyone will experience some form of back pain in his or her lifetime. The low back is the area behind the belly from the rib cage to the pelvis and is also called the lumbar region. Back pain is a major cause of missed work. Low back pain usually resolves on its own and is commonly the result of a strain injury. There are many treatments for low back pain.At Risk for Lower Back Pain?Low back pain can start in a person's early twenties and continue on throughout adulthood. Studies have shown that up to 80% of the general population are affected by low back pain (LBP) at some time during their lives. Learn to prevent lower back pain by knowing what activities could be putting you at risk.Common Causes of Low Back PainManual materials handling (especially lifting)Twisting of the trunkBending the trunk forwardBending the trunk to the sideExcessive reachingFallsProlonged sittingSedentary jobsHighly physical jobsExposure to whole-body vibrationCigarette smokingObesityExtreme tallnessLow Back Pain Symptoms: Does Your Back Hurt?Low back pain symptoms range from sharp and stabbing to a dull ache. The pains can be constant or intermittent and positional. Acute low back pain can appear suddenly after injury. Chronic back pain is defined as pain lasting more than three months. Consult a doctor if you have prolonged back pain longer than 72 hours.Low Back Pain and Serious Back InjuriesSevere back pain after an injury should be evaluated by a health-care professional. Warning signs of more serious injury include pain with coughing or urinating, loss of control of the bowels or bladder, new leg weakness, and fever. These additional symptoms require medical evaluation.Is It Muscle Strain or Sciatica?Back pain that occurs after excessive exercise or heavy lifting is frequently a strain injury. However, occasionally these activities cause disc injury and rupture or herniation. When a herniated disc irritates the sciatic nerve, it can cause back pain.What is Sciatica?Sciatica is a form of nerve pain caused by pressure on the sciatic nerve. The sciatic nerve is a large nerve that runs down through the buttocks and extends down the back of the leg. Pressing on or pinching of the sciatic nerve causes shock-like or burning low back pain. Sometimes people feel as if the pain radiates down through the buttocks and down one leg, sometimes even reaching the foot.Is Your Job Causing Back Pain?A job that involves pulling, lifting, or twisting with the low back can cause injury and low back pain. Even prolonged sitting in an awkward position can cause low back pain. Standing on your feet for hours on end? That can cause lower back pain too. The best way to prevent back pain is to know if you are at risk.Jobs That Can Cause Lower Back PainAirline crew (pilots, baggage handlers)SurgeonsNurses & healthcare workersBus and cab driversWarehouse workersConstruction workersCarpet installers and cleanersFarmers (agricultural, dairy)Firefighters and policeJanitorsMechanicsOffice personnel (eg, telemarketers, file clerks, computer operators)Find Back Pain Relief: Lighten Your BagsCarrying an overstuffed purse, briefcase, or handbag can strain the low back.

Help keep your kids' backs healthy by making sure their backpacks are not overloaded. A heavy backpack could mean future back pain for your little ones.Workouts That Can Cause Low Back PainMost athletic injuries to the back are sprains of the ligaments or strains of the muscles surrounding the spine. Serious conditions or complications can have similar symptoms to those of a routine sprain or strain. The most common sports injuries occur after repetitive overuse of the spine either through twisting, compr..."

114,"It's an interesting question. I do a lot of volunteer work. So, in essence, many people have ‘taken advantage‘ by something I've done. That's a good thing. I had an opportunity to give of myself, someone feels helped by it, and I feel good about having been helpful.But usually when someone expresses feeling taken advantage of, they mean it negatively. They are feeling ‘used’. That's not a good thing.No one can ‘take advantage of you’ without your consent. What I mean is that you have had to be a participant in it. Often when a person feels used is because they have given of themselves and feel unappreciated. Or they have given of themselves disproportionately. In either case, the person has consciously or unconsciously allowed themselves to be taken advantage of. Sometimes it's because of wanting to be liked. Sometimes it's because of low self-esteem. Best solution is to give of yourself freely and honestly, but only to the extent that you choose. Learn how to say ‘no’."

116,"A2aGood question indeed. I, myself, am a girl , still wonder why girls nowadays are so selfie addicted. Some of my friends also like to take selfies with lots of gesture though I personally hate it. I asked them the reason of it. Whatever I learnt, in short, people like having fun while clicking selfies. That's why they make pout face, stick their tongue out or duck face to look funny, no specific reason at all. It started out as a pout, in order to look more attractive, and then soon enough people started overdoing it until it became a fad. Stand out mention :  Though it is not a selfie, still, have you ever seen Albert Einstein’s picture of sticking out his tongue?On Einstein's 72nd birthday on March 14, 1951, UPI photographer Arthur Sasse was trying to persuade him to smile for the camera, but having smiled for photographers many times that day, Einstein stuck out his tongue instead.This photograph became one of the most popular ever taken of Einstein, who himself requested nine prints for his personal use.Source:The famous Einstein-with-his-tongue-out picture was taken after he got bored of smiling at his 72nd birthday!"
117,"YES, Hugely.Not only does the novel end with an impending murder of the protagonist but it turns out our “hero” dies without a single rebellious thought.The whole novel revolves around Winston’s “thoughtcrimes” and we are made to feel for his isolation precisely for that reason. We are heavily invested in Winston’s seditious thoughts and we (can’t speak for everyone but I surely did) want him to break free of the party’s control however insignificant that be. Even up to the very end when Winston betrays Julia we are allowed a little hope that Winston still intends to be rebellious (his resolve to hate the party moments before his death).We know he is broken and the party has effectively won but author still gives us hope of that. Turns out he quashes it at the final line of the novel. Perhaps it was deliberate and apt but it was surely depressing. “I love Big Brother” must be the most depressing ending in a fiction."

121,"A buffer state is essentially a territory from which two or more nations or governments involved in political strife or armed conflicts benefit from because it separates their borders. All buffer states are neutral in the sense that they do not give political or military support to either neighbour. They may or may not be allied with other nations which have no interest in that particular territory.However, a permanently neutral state is bound by international law from the Geneva Convention, recognised by all other nations, and is restricted from becoming a belligerent unless it is attacked by a hostile party. Note that, other states can claim to be neutral but is actually supporting another nation by not doing anything.Switzerland during two consecutive World Wars is both a buffer and a neutral state. It is a permanently neutral state recognised by the Geneva Convention.​​​Although Switzerland's neighbours are frequently involved in political scuffles or standoffs which eventually blew up into World War I and II, invading Switzerland to cross into France was not a practical option for the Germans or Italians becauseSwitzerlands harsh terrains prevent a quick military victory, andAll able-bodied Swiss males are armed and has received military training.So instead of slogging through Swiss men armed to the teeth, Switzerland is left alone to function as a buffer state to take the pressure off Germany and France's borders.Examples of neutral states which are not buffer states areMaltaCosta RicaAndorraVatican CityMalta and the Vatican benefit from Italian protection while Costa Rica's military was dissolved in 1949. Andorra is co-ruled by two ""Co-Princes"" since the time of Emperor Charlemagne - one of them is the head of state of France (used to be French King, position now held by the President) and the Bishop of Urgell.Another example of a buffer is Thailand, separating British Malaya and the Dutch East Indies (now Indonesia).

124,"I think the alternative to Machine Learning is directly embedding intuitions into computer programs. Machine Learning is all about learning from data. But you can still get a lot done and come up with a good solution if you give yourself time to tinker with your program. Unfortunately there is no recipe for building great programs this way. If you do attack a problem the non-ML way, you'll need lots of domain expertise and lots if time. The problem with tinkering with your program directly (adding custom if-s and custom for-loops), is that on many real-world problems you won't get very far with at least some machine learning. Object recognition folks used to write software comprising hand-written rules such as ""if edge is located above another edge, then output building"" but such programs didn't generalize to novel pictures very well. In my opinion it is very difficult to perform object recognition without a data set, and some learning component.Machine Learning is here to stay, but it doesn't mean everything in your programs will be learned from data. I think a better question is: how much machine learning should I be doing to solve problem X?With this new question in mind, the answer is almost always going to be a combination of being a smart and creative programmer half the time and a good data-scientist the other half."

The pretext will of course be 'War on Terror'.China is an expanisonist nation. They consider Taiwan, Tibet, CoK, Arunachal etc. all part of China. They are total back-stabbers and are the least loyal country in the world. All they want is to become the big daddy of the world.US is already the big daddy of the world and so that puts both of them into direct conflict. China will do anything to achieve superpower status and treats everyone as use-and-throw.Pakistan is the ultimate use and throw country of the world. US exploited Pak very well to push back the Soviets. Soviets are extinct, so now Pak is quite useless to US.Now, what US wants is to prevent China from becoming powerful. The only way they can prevent it is by supporting India. So now India is US's use and throw country. They know India is like the innocent kid, hell bent on helping everyone.Now, this puts China and India directly into conflict. Already, we have lots of disputes with China about water sharing, boundaries, etc. India being US's pawn is a major irritant for China.So what should they do? Well they know Pak is dumb and can be exploited very easily and as it is it has fallen out of favor with US, so Pak would love to lick their feet. Off they go to convince Pak. Pak accepts the proposal in return for China acting against India's interests.So that is why, China is rejecting India's candidature for NSG, UNSC and Masood's blacklisting. China very much knows India has become too strong for a war, so they are using their soft power. They are bribing nations with their line of credits and in return are getting support for they do and silence when they do something wrong.It's a big game of Chess which is being played here in South Asia. India-China relations will be what defines 21st century. India needs to stand up on its own and stop being reliant on other countries. As soon as each country achieves its objectives, they are gonna dump India.Everyone will provide India with enough support to keep China bogged down. But no one will ever provide India so much of support that Pakistani problem gets solved and China is defeated. This is because if India becomes more powerful than China, it means again India will be in direct conflict with Russia and US for the status of superpower.Russia made India pay extra for their defence equipments and forced India to buy only their equipments in exchange for their support and veto powers. So don't think Russia is our 'all weather ally'. Just see Russia and Pakistan's bonhomie.Conclusion:China is using its soft power to act against India's interests as Pakistan requested them to, in exchange for influence and furtherance of their objectives all over Asia through CPEC and Gwadar, both of which pass through Pakistan.Thank you for reading my answer !If you like my answer or style, do hit the upvote button and follow for more of such answers.I hope we meet again........Yours sincerely,The Aerospace Maven"

127,"Women who do use Vitamin C in the early days as one of their natural miscarriage methods need to consume one pill, of 500 mg every hour, for a period of 4 to 10 days. At times, women are asked to get up a few times in the middle of the night just to take the required number of pills during the night. While it is not a given that Vitamin C will lead to a miscarriage, taking this vitamin may just make it easier for a woman to miscarry. This is because Vitamin C has the ability to weaken the bond between the wall of the uterus and the egg. However, in order to induce a miscarriage with Vitamin C a woman will need to consume certain types of Vitamin C pills, as the foods that are high in Vitamin C do not contain the required doses. The ascorbic acid that is present in Vitamin C could cause a woman to miscarry, but most of the brands of Vitamin C tablets contain bioflavoids and other substances, which counter the effect of the ascorbic acid on the body. Tablets that do not contain bioflavoids usually do not have the required amount of ascorbic acid to induce a miscarriage in a person. Moreover, the Vitamin C pills will need to be taken in the early stages of pregnancy, for them to have any effect. This is because once the woman is past the 4th week of gestation, the bond between the egg and the walls of the uterus are too strong to be broken by Vitamin C.It is believed that after 4 weeks of gestation, Vitamin C will not lead to a miscarriage, but will reduce the supply of blood, oxygen and nutrients to the baby, which will result in baby with low birth weight, a disabled child or a child that is mentally stunted. This is one of the main reasons that most health experts strongly urge women to avoid using any home remedies for an abortion. Moreover, such practices are extremely dangerous and could have a seriously adverse effect on the woman's body. The damage caused by Vitamin C pills taken for an abortion could also be permanent not just for the mother, but also the child. Based on the woman's health condition and medical history, in some rare cases, consuming Vitamin C pills could also be fatal. Women who have any problems that are related to their kidneys should not use even try to induce miscarriage with Vitamin C. This is because a high level of ascorbic acid has can have a bad effect on the kidneys and could lead to kidney stones and other kidney related problems. Women, who take high doses if Vitamin C, generally suffer from copper deficiency, as this Vitamin interferes with the body's intake of the mineral. Hence they may be required to take a copper supplement too. However, it is absolutely essential to consult a doctor before taking any medication or vitamin."

129,"I'm going to open with some background, but I'll get to instructions - pinkie swear.""Deep web"" is distinct from ""dark web"". The ""dark web"" is the encrypted network that exists between Tor servers and their clients, whereas the ""deep web"" is simply the content of databases and other web services that for one reason or another cannot be indexed by conventional search engines.Clearing Up Confusion - Deep Web vs. Dark WebHere be dragonsNeither the deep web nor the dark web can be indexed, but not all that cannot be indexed is the dark web. For purposes of this question, I assume you want the dark web - that much-hyped, mysterious place that the media would have you believe is a wretched hive of scum and villainy where you'd be well-served to shoot first if you hope to survive. Activists will tell you it's our last, best hope for privacy and free speech, all alone in the night.As with most things, the truth falls somewhere in between. But you didn't come here for analysis, you came here for instructions. Fair enough.First of all, if you want anyone who matters to take you seriously, drop the ""dark/deep web"" thing. What you want to access are sites using the Tor Hidden Service Protocol. It works over regular Tor (anonymity network), but instead of having your traffic routed from your computer and through an onion-like layer of servers, it stays within the Tor network. You won't know exactly what system you're accessing unless they tell you, and they won't know who you are unless they do - or unless one of you is careless.But given that you're the one starting out and they're the ones running hidden services, they kind of have you at a disadvantage if you screw up. Fortunately, the tales of people having their lives ruined by browsing the wrong sites and being hunted by mafiosi bent on silencing them for having witnessed a mob hit inexplicably streamed online are massively overblown. At most, you might find yourself mercilessly trolled, get pizzas ordered to your door, or if you're particularly unfortunate, get Swatted.‘Swatting’ Prank Ends Horribly for Victim — and He Has the Injury to Prove ItThe simplest way to start using Tor is to download the Tor browser bundle (assuming you're on Windows). You can get it at: Tor Browser. You can find installation instructions for Tor on other operating systems on the same page.Once it's installed and launched, the browser should connect automatically to the Tor network. From there, you can use a directory of certain hidden services to get started. Some of these directories include:Hidden Wiki | Tor .onion urls directoriesHiddenWiki Deep Web LinksThe uncensored hidden wiki is up: http://kpvz7kpmcmne52qf.onion/wiki/index.php/Main_Page • /r/TORThese sites may contain links to illegal services and are provided for informational purposes only.

131,"Because Kim swears up and down that he only wants to develop nuclear weapons for self-defense, and both Russia and China believe him.Look, you need to know a bit of the history of this. You see, when North and South Korea signed the ceasefire agreement, the assumption was that a peace treaty would be negotiated within 3 months. The 3 months came and gone, and for one reason or another, there was no peace treaty, so the two Koreas were still officially at war. So North Korea asked USSR to keep it under its nuclear umbrella, and USSR agreed. That was why, from the 50's all the way till the 90's, North Korea focused on growing its economy, and did not dabble into nuclear weapons. It was doing so well that when South Korea suffered deadly flood in 1969, North Korea sent food and aid to South Korea then.Then USSR collapsed in 1991. Overnight, the nuclear umbrella covering North Korea was gone, together with the cheap oil, which led to the collapse of North Korea's industrial sector (no fuel) and agriculture (no fertilizer, which is synthesized from petroleum). So North Korea asked if China would provide it with nuclear umbrella, and China refused, basically said, ""look, we don't do this nuclear umbrella thing. Not with anybody. Why don't you open a couple of sea ports and do some trade like us?"" So North Korea said to Russia and China, ""But we are different, we are still officially at war, and the US/South Korea can invade us the next day, unless somebody put us under his nuclear umbrella. If you guys don't give us protection, we'll have to do something ourselves."" Which is exactly the same response the British and the French took when the US refused to share its nuclear technology with them!So what I'm saying is that this situation is not something people blunder into. Everybody (the US, Russia, China, the two Koreas, Japan, etc. ) all walked into this with their eyes wide open. All of them know of this since 1991, OK? And all of these countries know exactly what North Korea want - a peace treaty. That's why people spent over a decade in the Six-party talks, and the talk got stuck on one thing - the US said, ""give up your nuclear program and we'll negotiate a peace treaty with you"", and North Korea said, ""give us a peace treaty and we'll give up our nuclear program"". You can read up all about it. The one time it got close to a peace treaty and de-nuclearization of the Korean Peninsula was during the last year of the Clinton admin. The next year, Bush II came in and announced that Iraq, Iran, and North Korea were the ""Axis of Evil"" and then proceeded to invade Iraq. North Korea took a look and said, well, I better keep my little nuclear bomb then... Chronology of U.S.-North Korean Nuclear and Missile Diplomacy Despite the hyperbolic media circus, North Korea wants one thing, which is a Security Guarantee. The guy who is so insistent on a security guarantee is NOT the one who wants to start a WWIII. It's a guy who wants to be left alone. PS: And let's be honest, given the hostile reaction to the Iran deal domestically, no US president will be in a hurry to do a North Korea deal any time soon! The US has been so invested in demonizing the shit out of half of the globe that the only politically feasible thing to do, for successive US administrations, is to ""kick the can down the road."" Back in 1991, nobody thought it would take 25 years and still no peace treaty in sight."
132,"Google Apps for Work – Gmail, Drive, Docs and More is one of the better options if you also have an Android device like a tablet or mobile phone. But it works fine with iOS too, but Android and Google Apps are very closely connected. The drawback? It costs about €4 per month. Roughly the same in US dollars.But first you would have to register your domain name if you haven’t done that yet. And you will need a registrar who will allow you to change your own DNS settings and which will register the domain in your name and not theirs. This means that free registrars aren’t an option and registering a domain can cost about €5 to €15 per year for the more common extensions like COM, ORG and NET. Other extensions might be even more expensive.So, you already have costs for your domain name. And Google Apps provides you much more than just email. They provide you an online calendar and contact list, plus lots of online storage for backups. This is basically a version of GMail on your own domain.It also allows you to create an unlimited amount of email aliases by setting up a catch-all account. Plus, you have Google Groups connected to your domain too, allowing you to set up various mailing lists with whatever name you like, which you could use as an alternative mailbox.You will need some experimenting and learning to use it properly, though."
133,"Very much so. And unfortunately, to even younger girls.While a teen I've been vaguely aware of it mainly from second/ third hand sources. But I was pretty sheltered, and didn't venture much beyond school activities with my peers, so hardly experienced it personally.When I was a grad student I was shocked to see how common and intense was the attraction of older men towards girls. I know that many people on Quora stress that young females are women, but I'm referring here to underage girls (many 15 -17) who looked their age. (And for those who were wondering how the girls were dressed - very ""plainly"", these were students from low-income rural families who couldn't afford stylish clothing.)During the Summer I used to work for a program for high school kids who spent several weeks on the campus. As a part of the program we took them to visit various industries, etc. When we were out and about, I saw how grown men of all ages STARED their eyes out at the girls. In fact, it was so pervasive that it was my most disturbing recollection of working for the program. When the students got all dressed up and did their final presentations, I happened to sit at the back of the auditorium and saw some of the male instructors also staring out at the females. Once when we were in a hotel dining room I saw a male in his 30's, who was there with his wife, a small infant and an older couple (his or her parents) stare ACROSS the room at the girls who were in plain white Walmart T-shirts, with wet hair from the swimming pool. And I'm by no means referring to quick, appreciative ""ain't she cute""  glances. These were prolonged, leering, predatory stares.And the strange thing I noticed was that the teen boys in the program behaved much, much more circumspectly towards the girls. For all the talk of testosterone driven young males, I didn't notice, or hear of, anything remotely comparable in my several years of working for the program. (And I interacted with the students a lot outside the classroom - in their residence halls, on trips out of town, etc. Because most of the students were minors the staff were required to keep a close watch on them at all times.)"
134,"In engineering the strongest structures  may be regarded as those that obtain a high degree of strength from a  minimal amount of material, being efficient structures, lightweight, and  as strong as their geometries could allow given the various contexts.  There is no single strongest structure, as there are many different  types of strength. Some truss like structures present the optimum  geometries for resisting cantilever stresses as you mentioned, remaining rigid by  reducing bending moments, resisting deformation under a combination of  compression, tension and shear. Other structures present the most  efficient geometry for resisting purely compressive stresses,  distributing loads efficiently with the shortest paths to minimize  lateral buckling. It seems this is what you're after but it's not quite so simple. Still others represent the strongest geometries for  resisting purely tension, carrying the force in a direct route so as not  to amplify the stress.Also there are singular shapes which hold their form in circumstances  where pressures are exerted at different points, i.e. catenary curves  and catenary domes, spherical domes, and pyramids and triangles.Before the strongest structure for a particular circumstance can be  established, it is necessary to determine the kinds of stresses the  structure must resist.TensionThe most efficient geometry for carrying solely tensile stress is a  straight line parallel with the direction of the force, such a steel  cable. These are extensively used in suspension bridges, which are  popular as tension elements typically require significantly less  material than compression elements which must resist buckling. If a  cable were to branch out at various angles, the stress carried by the  original cable would be amplified.Far more complicated geometries arise when loads are carried on a cable  running perpendicularly to the direction of the force. The catenary  curve is the optimum geometry for carrying such loads if they are  uniform at all points, both in compression and in tension.  Also when such loads must be carried at various angles, over a large  sheet or mesh, the optimum geometry becomes very complex. Frei Otto did  pioneering work with soap bubble films, which spread between points to  find the minimum possible surface area, and when the geometry is  translated into a tension structure, the least amount of material may be  used to cover a specific area.CantileverThe strongest known truss for resisting tension and compression is an  octet-truss, but only in terms of a repeating isotropic geometry, and  this structure is used extensively with cantilever and long spanning  roof applications. The structure is composed of a repeating tessellation  of octahedrons and tetrahedrons, which are made up of triangular faces.  The triangle is the best shape for remaining rigid as it does not give  in to geometric distortion without changing the length of one of its  edges; in contrast to squares which may be easily distorted into various  parallelograms. The triangle does the best job of minimizing bending  momentsCompressionThe strongest known truss structure for resisting compression with an isotropic geometry is a  lorimerlite framework, however only in terms of a repeating geometry  (isotropic). This structure reduces the danger of lateral buckling as  each beam finds the shortest unbraced path within the structure. Also  loads are distributed evenly at each tetrahedral joint.A tessellation of hexagons is the strongest isotropic geometry when considering only two dimensions.Frei Otto, again, did some pioneering work with tree like branching  structures. A thick column would branch into more slender beams, into  again more slender beams, which would concentrate compressive forces  into the central column with each beam resisting buckling due to their  short individual lengths. This kind of tree like branching structure  represents the optimum, anisotropic, structural geometry.Read more:  What is the strongest shape for a structure?? | Answerbag What is the strongest shape for a structure??"

143,"Yes.Mass is one of the three distinguishing traits a black hole can have (the other two are angular momentum and electric charge).I should note however that this mass doesn’t really represent a specific ‘amount’ of matter that makes up the black hole. A black hole is actually a region of space-time, so the mass manifests in the structure of the space-time itself. This means it is possible to measure different masses for a black hole depending on how you define mass. A black hole isn’t a material body where you can count the number of particles that make it up or anything like that."

That's HUA thinking.  White people have made talking about race socially unacceptable. This hasn't worked  in addressing policies that impact Black people and other people of color. In-the-closet may work for a poorly designed suit, but it doesn't work for policies (legislative and educational and others) that affect Black people and other people of color.  The policies are real, the issues are real and they need to be unpacked and talked about, by adults who know the meaning of the word dialogue.

147,"we need to find the various groups of combinations of numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, ….10 which add up to 10 which include 4 combinations per group. The total number of such groups can be expressed as E = [(n - 1)!]{Σ1/[(j - 1)!][(n - j)!]}, where n = total number of identical items and j, the number of groups, each of which sums to n, = 1, 2, 3, …. → n. With regard to a response to this question, n =10 and j = 4. Therefore, E(j=4) = 9!/(3!)(6!) = 84 = number of ways 10 identical pencils can be distributed to 4 students such that each gets at least 1 pencil.Just for the sake of completeness, let’s consider those groups of 1, 2 and 3 combinations, summing to 10, which add to the ways of distribution of pencils to 4 students. For j = 1, E(j=1) = 9!/(0!)(9!)) =1. Arrangements to accommodate 4 students are 4!/3! = 4 per group and ways to distribute are thus (4!)(3!) =4. Similarly for J = 2, E(j=2) = 9!/(1!)(8!) = 9. Arrangements to suit 4 students are 4!/2! = 12 and ways to distribute to 4 students = (12)(9) = 108. Finally, for j = 3, E(j=3) = 9!/(2!)(7!) = 36. Arrangements to suit 4 students are (4!)/(1!) = 24 and ways to distribute to 4 students are (24)(36) = 864. Total of ways to distribute 10 identical pens to 4 students, without qualification regarding number of pencils to any student = 4+108+864+84 = 1060, which accounts for all groups of pencil combinations of 1, 2, 3, and 4, each of which sums to 10 pencils.

148,"There’s no fixed cost for car insurance. It depends on six factors:Let’s understand why and how:1. The value of your car· Insured Declared Value· Your insurance depends on your car’s value. It’s called the Insured Declared Value or IDV. You can opt to reduce this amount.· Sum assured· The IDV is the maximum amount the insurance company promises to pay during a claim.· IDV affects premium· This can affect your car insurance premium amount. The higher the IDV, the higher is your premium.· Don’t forget depreciation· Your car’s parts get old. So, when it comes to replacing or repairs, the insurance company takes this into account.Market value – Depreciation = Insurance payout· You can lower your IDV· This IDV is not fixed. You can opt for an insurance with a lower IDV. This can lower your premium cost.· But remember, this means you may have to pay from your pocket if the damages exceed the IDV.2. The type of car insuranceNot every insurance offers the same coverage. It depends on the type of insurance.There are three main kinds of insurance policies available for your car. They are as follows:1) Third-PartyThis is a bare-minimum policy. It covers only the damage caused to another person and his/her vehicle. It has the lowest premium.2) ComprehensiveThis policy covers all kinds of damages—to your car, another car, and the car driver.Damages include:· Collision· Theft· Fire· Sabotage· Natural occurrencesSince this type of insurance offers greater coverage than a third-party insurance, it costs more.Your basic comprehensive car insurance premium consists of:· Cost of third-party cover· Own damage cover cost· Personal Accident cover for the owner (Rs 100)· Service tax of 15%**May change over time.3) Zero DepreciationThis is an Add-on to a Comprehensive policy. It lowers the money you pay during claimed car repairs. It has the highest premium.Why you need Zero Depreciation Add-on· Your car’s value falls every year. This is called Depreciation. This affects you when you give the car for repair in the event of a mishap.· Your insurance company only pays a portion of the bill. This happens because the insurance company takes into consideration the depreciated value of the parts. However, a Zero-Depreciation policy avoids this. It will pay for the entire bill including the depreciation.· Usually, you can claim twice under a Zero-depreciation policy in a year.Here’s the approximate cost of the premium for a car worth Rs 4 lakh with an engine capacity of 1,200 cc.Third-party Rs. 2,237Comprehensive Policy Rs. 6,000Zero-Depreciation Rs. 8,000These costs further increase when you take on Add-ons.1. Add-on coverageYou can increase the protection the insurance offers through Add-ons. The more the Add-ons, the higher would be the car insurance premium.The four common Add-ons are:· Engine protection· NCB protection· Invoice cover· Personal Accident cover (another driver)2. Your car’s ageAs discussed earlier, your Insured Declared Value depends on your car’s value. But, this reduces every year. So, the older your car, the lower its value. This can lower your premium—and the sum assured.However, a higher age also makes the car riskier. It’s more susceptible to damages. So, car companies often check your car’s health while deciding the premium.3. Extra security featuresOne of the easiest ways to reduce your car insurance premium is by installing anti-theft and other security features.This is because insurance companies are in the business of lowering your risk.This comes at a price—the premiums you pay.The lower the risk, the lower is your insurance cost.4. Your claim historyCar insurance companies reward good drivers - those who do not claim.This is done through a ‘No-claim Bonus’.This bonus can be in the form of a discount on your premium. This reduces your car insurance cost.Similarly, if insurance companies see a history of multiple claims, it could drive up costs."
149,"There was a sick, flea ridden stray pup near my home which seemed mortally ill. It would wander into my garden repeatedly and while picking it up and putting it away, I would grab it's head and my thumb and fingers brushed against the area near it's mouth/chin a couple of times. No scratches, no saliva, no biting or nibbling, nothing. Every time I would wash my hands with a liquid-handwash. But the pup died that very evening. It did not occur to me for several days that it could have died from rabies. Finally when I did, I rushed to my doctor and started an anti-rabies vaccine course on the seveth day, just to be on the safer side. Is it too late to get vaccination at day-7?"
150,"Britishers ruled India for 200 years. We got rid of them in 1947 and Robert Clive won the battle of Plassey in 1757, so that is a neat 190 years. What’s the problem?The problem is that Robert Clive only won over Bengal in 1757, which was a (major) province/kingdom in India. Here is how British rule in India looked like in 1805Some other dates are pertinent: Mysore state was won over in 1799, Marathas were finally defeated in 1818, and Sikh empire was finally defeated only by 1849. There might be other smaller kingdoms that fought even later but these three were major powers of the sub-continent.It seems that we can with better accuracy say that the British took nearly 100 years to conquer India and then ruled India for 100 years. In fact, the suppression of the 1857 revolt is when the rule really consolidated and officially passed to the British Empire. It was with the East India Company before that. The Company was one of the great powers on the Indian sub-continent but surely not its ruler.So why is this 200 years interpretation the popular one?Historical narrative is often subjected to current political constraints. The slaves of a foreign power for 200 years narrative seeks to build modern nationalism. As Benedict Anderson has found, shame is an important foundation of nationalism. Would a narrative saying Britishers ruled India for 90 years have the same impact in coalescing Indians with their primary loyalties to local communities or kingdoms into modern nationalistic Indian? The only power that could contradict the narrative — the British — would never do it for the opposite reason — pride. Rulers of India for 200 years? Sure, we will take that on our collective resumes.In the same vein, there is a new narrative of 1200 years of slavery that has been mentioned by the PM himself on multiple occassions. Now that we understand the underlying mechanism, this is similar to building a sense of shame that can create Hindu nationalism. Kashmiri separatists try the same with a narrative of foreign rule since 1586 (when Akbar invaded Kashmir) to instill the feelings of Kashmiri nationalism.Given that most of these narratives need suspension of reason (for example, one needs to forget the mighty Maratha Empire that lasted nearly 150 years in the 1200 narrative) it is puzzling why they last. The only reason I can think of is that the political objective powering the narrative is strong while there is none (or a weak one) that wants to counter it. People are mostly lazy thinkers (as Kahneman shows) and will accept narratives that are hurled at them repeatedly with force.I wish a sense of collectively, imagined future we can be proud of could act as a stronger basis of nationalism than an imagined history that we are ashamed of. History should be a matter of discovery where facts build stories and we are happy to adjust our stories as new facts emerge. The shared ordeal of the Independence movement and Indian constitution give us enough basis for a modern nationalism. The process of figuring a collective future and the energy needed to overcome current challenges can drive a modern nationalism. It seems more pragmatic to say — our time starts now and march towards the next 200 years.—Source from Medium–"
151,"Best way to learn? Roll your sleeves up (Even proverbially) and listen to your boss. Listen to those who have done it before.Also cut yourself some slack, no one expects a “never worked before” 18 year old to walk in the door like a managing director. Remember, even the old guys had to start somewhere, they too had a first day and they too were pooping their pants.Just remember to be polite, and respectful. Don’t be afraid to admit your fears and ask for help. Most decent people shall feel proud that you asked them, then protective of you. Most decent people shall take you under their wing and help you all they can.In a mans environment you can also expect them to take the piss, send you on stupid errands like going to the store room and asking for tartan paint, a long stand and a bucket of blue mist. These are all signs of their acceptance of you. They mean no harm, they are just having a laugh.Expect foul language now and then, you are not in school any more and for goodness sake, don’t call them Mr Smith or what ever, certainly not sir, their first name please. Remember you aren’t in school anymore.Don’t be afraid. Its a big world and you are just getting started. Theres a lot to enjoy.Good luck and healthy regards,Brian."
152,"The thing to know about Red is that she’s extremely conscious of power plays. While Litchfield offers many opportunities to throw your weight around without them, Red is a student of Vee. All the social promotion given by Ganya and the Russians didn’t keep Red from entering prison as scared, meek Galina Reznikov. She’s “Red” because of Vee. And she doesn’t let hatred of Vee keep her from learning things from her. Red explicitly forbids drugs. She makes drug use the dividing line between her family and the hillbillies, because Vee was a bloodsucking drug dealer. Red’s solution to winning her family back is to cook a big special dinner. Why? Because providing wholesome meals for her dixie cups like Taystee and RJ was how Vee kept them from telling her to get fucked when they wised up. By keeping Aydin’s keys, Red is demonstrating once again why she is Apollo Creed’s Rocky. Vee’s number one student.Do you remember the first episode where Piper was about to make her bed and Anita was like DON’T MAKE YOUR BED!!!! We’ll do it for you! Piper kept telling her that it was okay, that you all don’t have to do it, and Anita kept insisting. Well when Anita first moved into the transfer dorm at the same time as Red all those years ago, a woman named Carla did that to Anita, but it seemed so far from being a power play that Anita was just like ‘okay’. But then Vee came in and waved off Anita’s suggestion that “Carla’s gonna wanna do that for you” on the grounds that “I’ve been around before.” Anita right then figured out what the situation was, and so did Red who also watched this seemingly innocuous exchange. That’s right. Piper was hit with a power play in her first day at Litchfield not just from Red with the food, but from Anita DeMarco.The difference between how Red sees things and how more conventional criminal masterminds like Frida sees things is demonstrated this season with those guard’s keys. Frida was not in the Vee-School-Of-Ways-To-End-Up-Slocked-In-A-Greenhouse, so she takes the keys off Alex and Lolly’s hands as a simple present, like getting a magic key in Legend of Zelda or something. Red however knows that whoever owns these keys…is more powerful then the other inmates. Because Vee believed that “if you have something the girls want, they’ll respect you for it”, it was this advice that gave Red the perception of power over the others by the time we meet her in Season 1. Red has the contraband trade…and so even Claudette takes her to be someone not to mess with, lest she have to, for instance, obtain and hide her own vial of Mexican vanilla extract."
153,I lost my virginity when I was 12 years old.I had 2 male best friends at the time and the rest of them were girls. They were both older than me but we were really close to. I was in 6th grade and they were in 8th. So them being 14 almost 15 they were more interested in girls. Before having sex i did let them touch me and stuff like i let them rub and squeeze booty because I had a nice butt for my age and they never got to before. I also let them feel my boobs and vagina. We also kissed and they let me feel them to. As you can see the 3 of us were very close. Then one day during lunch we were sitting in one of the hallways in the basement that know one goes down ever and we started talking about whatever and one of them had their arm around me with his hand on as much of my butt as he could because we were sitting down. And the other one had his hand on my thigh and he was gently rubbing it and started getting closer to my crotch and i was getting horny. Then the one with his arm around me started to lightly kiss my neck. then I was super horny moaning a little and i was getting wet and they knew because I was wearing leggings and no panties so it was very noticeable. Then they were both rubbing my thighs and vagina. I started to rub their cocks and when they were ready before i knew it my leggings were off and I was riding one of them while sucking the other. It was hard because i had nothing to rest on but while standing i took it from behind while sucking one of them. I don't remember exactly but i think they both finished in my mouth and I swallowed because we wouldn't want to make a mess. We had sex many times afterwards and it ended when they got to their sophomore year because they were at a different school and i was in 8th grade and they were getting busy so we didn't have any time after school. We eventually stopped talking and never seen each other again.

One of the best zooms are your legs!However, the Canon is quite heavy, even with light lenses. If you are going to walk around or hike a lot, the Canon may become hard on your arms after a while. The 6D (with a lens stated above) will be around 30 oz. However, the Leica 109 is only 8 oz. You can carry this around ALL DAY and not feel a thing.The Leica has 10.1 mp vs the 20.2 mp of the 6D. If you are doing more serious photography, you will have to stick with the Canon. If it’s more for fun though, the Leica will be fine.So: if you are taking pictures for less than 5–6 hours a day and you are doing it more seriously, use the Canon with a few versatile prime lenses.Otherwise, the Leica will be perfect.Happy Shooting!"

163,"Twitter has been one of the easiest way to promote Business and I made more sales on Twitter than any other Social Media Business Accounts!Complete your profile (don’t forget to input your website, it’s really important to drive traffic to your site.)DO NOT BUY FOLLOWERS. I’ve read a lot that you should buy followers in order to gain followers easier. However, based on my experience, buying followers is a bad move to your business! It looks good on your profile having huge followers but it will have no engagement and it will be hard for you to find and communicate well to your real followers! Most of the success stories on building an empire on twitter is a consistent effort of following real people and hope for a followback. Follow 500 people/day, after 4–5 days, unfollow people who didn’t follow you back. Rinse. Repeat.BEWARE ON AUTOMATION. I tried manual direct messaging when I gained new followers and I received great and fast replies and a real interaction. I got tired on manual so I used a tool, crowdfire to be exact. It’s a good tool but it looks unprofessional because I was only using the free account so it has -@crowdfire at the end of my message. Since I did auto direct messaging, I didn’t get any replies, and if I did, it’s a promotion of other people and I never get an interaction. :( So, always beware on automating things, if you want to remove the -@crowdfire, you should pay for the tool to make it look personal message to your gained followers.FOCUS on type of your tweets. Will you tweet a “text”, “picture”, “infographics”? If you are planning to tweet a text, be consistent, if you’re going to tweet picture, be consistent, as well as on infographics. Focus on that. Mix tweets doesn’t look good on timeline and you’re sending people away on your timeline. Make it look better. Let’s say you want to tweet picture, maybe you can do it once or twice a week if you’re tweeting text.DO NOT BE TOO SALES-Y.INTERACT A LOT. Interact with your followers as much as you can. reply to them when they tweeted you.REACH INFLUENCERS. Follow influencers in your industry. Mention them on your tweets. Talk to them.USE TOOLS. As I mentioned above, I failed on using tool because I wasn’t willing to pay for the tool. If you want to automate things, you must be willing to pay for it to make your message looks personal. Use hootsuite to schedule your tweets at once.BE PERSONAL. Be yourself. Do not send long messages. Just keep it short simple and make yourself feel like you are just having a conversation and sales will take care of itself."

167,"Thanks for the A2A, Yoav!Original question: Which is correct - 'Looking forward to speak with you' or 'Look forward to speak with you'?Looking forward and look forward are both correct in this context. But you must change speak with to speaking with.Note that in the first construction the subject-helping verb I am is implied. I am looking forward to... sounds more familiar and casual than the other.I am looking forward to speaking with you this weekend.I am looking forward to hanging out with you after school.I am looking forward to getting to know you better at the party.In the second it is only the subject I that is implied. I look forward to... sounds more formal and businesslike than the other.I look forward to speaking with you soon or I look forward to hearing from you soon sounds like the last sentence in a cover letter in an application for a job. That does not mean that one is always and only formal and one is always and only casual, but that relative to each other one sounds more formal than the other, the other sounds more casual than the first. For example, depending on his posture and expression and tone of voice, etc., a school bully could use either to invite you to meet him after school:School bully 1: I look forward to beating you to a pulp after school, punk. He sounds menacing, powerful, authoritative. I is standing motionless, no expression on his face. School bully 2: I am looking forward to beating you to a pulp after school, punk! He is enjoying himself, an evil grin on his face. He is rubbing his hands together, anxious to use them to beat me up.These are not absolutes, just examples of how I hear the difference!Hope this helps!"

Cologne is also a city of rich history, and the Cathedral is the pride of every local here.

185,"The significance of the Battle of the Somme is that for many it signifies the senseless waste and slaughter of the First World War. Towards the end of 1915 the Allied commanders on the Western Front held a meeting in which they would determine the direction the Allies would take in the next year. They agreed that there would be a joint Anglo-French offensive spanning either side of the Somme river while simultaneous offensive would take place on the Italian and Eastern front. Meanwhile the German high command had their own plan which Falkenhayn came up with. Falkenhayn had realised that Germany’s main enemy in the war is Britain because even if they could beat the French they would still have to cross the channel which was impractical given the Royal navies dominance at seas, so Falkenhayn realised that to win he had to knock England’s best sword out of her hand as he phrased and beat the French. To do this he would attack and capture Verdun and then let the French bleed themselves white trying to take it back. On 21st February Falkenhayn launched his offensive with an enormous barrage by 1200 guns in a small narrow sector. Within two days the Germans had fired 2 million shells and then they attacked . The attack was successful in some areas and difficult in other areas. As a result of this attack the French began pouring more and more divisions into the Verdun down the road they would christen the Sacred way. As more and more french division were sucked into a wilderness of shell craters and blood they realised that they would not be able to fully support the offensive on the Somme as planned and as a result the offensive became largely a British affair. Over the next few months as the bloodbath at Verdun continued huge numbers of British troops from the New army or Kitchener’s army as they were called began to flood into Amiens in preparation as well as huge numbers of shells being stockpiled. The Germans could not fail to notice this so they began to prepare accordingly. In the week leading up to the 1st of July (the set start of the offensive) the Britsh artillery began to rain down shells day and night on the German lines day and night without end. During the week of shelling 1.5 millions shells were fired however at least 1/3rd of all shells failed to explode which would have tragic consequences on the 1st of July as the wire would remain uncut. On the 1st of July 1916 the offensive began at 7:30 in the morning with 5 divisions of French troops on the south side of the Somme, 11 British divisions of General Rawlinson’s 4th army and 2 divisions of the British third army opposite Gommecourt. At the same time mines were blown all along the front with two notable mines blown being at Hawthorn ridge and the Lochnagar crater. 150 000 men along and 18 mile front emerged from their trenches and walked in some places and ran in others. The Germans upon hearing the artillery stop knew the time for the attack had come and emerged from their dugouts in which they hidden from the bombardment, and began setting up their machine guns. Across the field of no man’s land they could see line after line of British infantry marching forward and could not have asked for better targets. The advancing British were mown down in droves. An example of the slaughter is the attack made by the Newfoundland regiment that were attacking Beaumont Hamel in the Norther sector of the battlefield. Out of a regiment of 750 men who attacked only 68 could answer muster the next day. To the north of the Albert Bapaume upon which the offensive was taking place the attacks achieved nothing but horrendous casualties while South of the road there were some limited successes while the french sector saw a quick advance that got bogged down. At the end of the day the casualties had been horrific with the British suffering 57 000 casualties of which 19 000 were killed..."

188,"Instead of a yes or no answer, I’d like to introduce you to Story Musgrave.Haven’t heard of him? Aside from being a NASA Astronaut, Story has spent equal time in his life as a Marine, Doctor, Designer, Engineer, Artist, Mathematician, Speaker and Consultant. He holds six formal academic degrees, not because he was chasing credentials, but because he found them fascinating.His started his journey studying for an MA in Music and Biology in Massachusetts, before dropping out to join the marines. He served in Korea as an aircraft crew chief while completing duty assignments aboard the carrier USS Wasp in the Far East. Here, he discovered his passion for flying, which he kept with him for life, flying over 17,700 hours in 160 different types of civilian and military aircraft (oh, and he’s skydived 800 times too).After the marines, Story received a B.S. degree in Mathematics and Statistics from Syracuse University in 1958, an MBA degree in Operations Analysis and Computer Programming from the University of California, Los Angeles in 1959, and a B.A. degree in Chemistry from Marietta College in 1960. In between these academic stints, Story worked as a mathematician and operations analyst for Kodak Film in New York.After that got boring, he decided to become a doctor. He completed an M.D. from Columbia University in 1964, and an M.S. in Physiology and Biophysics from the University of Kentucky in 1966 (for good measure). Story practiced on a part-time basis at Denver General Hospital and was an instructor of physiology and biophysics at the University of Kentucky. During this time, he wrote or co-authored twenty five scientific papers in the areas of aerospace medicine and physiology.Logically, Story decided it was time to go to space and become an astronaut. And so he did. A veteran of six space flights, Musgrave has spent a total of 1,281 hours, 59 minutes, 22 seconds on space missions, including nearly 27 hours of EVA. He is also the only astronaut to have flown on all five Space Shuttles, and was one of the oldest people to ever orbit the earth, at the tender age of 61.Bonus: Somehow, during all of this, Story managed to fit in one last degree in Literature from the University of Houston in 1987."
189,"Christian Bale, without a doubt.Before all the Bat-Fleck fans out there start raging out there, yes, I know the direction was crappy from The dawn of justice and that might be the reason for Ben Affleck’s appalingly dull portrayal as our favorite superhero. Nevertheless, had it been Christian Bale in his place, he would have pulled it off will all the awesomeness that Batman really is.See, in the Dark Knight Trilogy, Batman was cool, composed and amazing. Yes, most credit goes to Nolan’s direction of the film and the glorious effects. But Bale knew how to pull it off, he didn’t bring out a wimpy, talkative aid to Batman’s character like Affleck so negatively did.And yes, people would say that Affleck’s portrayal was like the “real batman” as in the one in the comics but in that case it is wrong as well. Affleck’s portrayal of the “real Batman” was quite not upto the mark either. “The real Batman” was played perfectly only by Michael Keaton in the 1989 movie.Affleck was neither here nor there. He really just blew the whole thing up. His action was so dull, I literally stopped watching Dawn of Justice midway. On the other hand, to this very day, I watch the Dark Knight trilogy over and over again.To add to my answer, I have a bit of proof here:The first image is to prove that I didn't google for “Christian Bale the best Batman or something like that”Business Insider is a plausible site and also the first option that google gave. So, take a look:So, there you have it! Clearly Bale is the better Batman."

191,"A short story.Mulla loved his wife so much. One day he found that his wife’s hearing ability is getting worse. So he wanted to cure her issue without his knowledge. So he went to a doctor and explains the situation. The doctor agrees to help with one condition. The doctor said I can help but I want to know how bad is your wife’s hearing ability so check from at what distance your wife can hear you.So Mulla started his process. When he returned home he found his wife to be in the kitchen. So from outside of the house, he shouted, What are you cooking today, there was no reply. So he went outside the kitchen and asked the same question even for this there is no reply. He was shocked. So he decided to go near to her and asked in front of her face.After hearing this, his wife slapped Mulla hard and said, at the first time itself I told you that I was cooking roti today. Then Mulla found it was not his wife’s hearing problem which is weak, actually, it’s his own hearing ability which is weaker.We are like this, for our problem we are complaining about others. So the only solution is to stop asking questions. Because ten questions arise from an answer. It is your imagination that is the root cause of possessiveness. Stop being a slave to your own imagination.Peace."

199,"I strongly disagree with most of the answers here. Don’t let “so called economists” mislead you who says after demonetization of 500/1000 rupees notes, the real estate sector will go down, without correcting your facts.People are claiming that real estate industry involves the maximum amount of black money, and as there will be shortage of black money after government’s bold decision, the demand for the properties will reduce. And as the demand supply graph works, lower demand means lower prices. The thing you are missing here is, real estate sector is not just about black money and pricing system in an industry is not just about demand and supply relation.We can divide this industry in majorly two parts to understand the effects of currency ban:1. Agriculture land and individual plots: These are the two types of properties which might see the downfall.These properties are generally bought long back with a very lesser amount compared to the present rates, so the prices of these two types of properties are completely depended on the market value. So if the market value of any property decreases, automatically the price of that property will decrease. Now since these properties involve the maximum amount of black money, shortage of black money will reduce the number of potential buyers from market, reducing market value, finally reducing the prices.2. All the other type of properties (Commercial office spaces, apartments, developer plots, villas etc.)These types of properties involve negligible or no black money. So the reduction of black money will have minimum effect on the demand of these types of properties.Secondly prices of these are not just depended on the market demand. A huge amount is first invested by builders to develop the property. So in these cases margins on invested amount plays a major role in deciding the property’s price. Since the real estate market has already been witnessing recession since last 3 years, builders have reduced their margins to the lowest. So there is no further scope of price reductions as no businessman will sell his product with a loss. The prices may stay still, but will not see downfall for sure.The mentioned points are the cases when the demand stays the same as before or goes down. But we should notice here that since the banks will be flooded with cash after government’s decision of demonetization of 500/1000 rupees notes, the loan process will be eased and the interest rates will be reduced. These properties were already being transacted without any black money, and now since there would be easy home loans at lower interest rates, demand of these properties might even INCREASE.So guys please correct your facts and stop believing everything you read. This time is the best time to buy property. The prices may not go up in a short span, but these will not go down for sure."

Feel it. Deep down. It’s there.“I’ll become a billionaire.”As if it was just a matter of when. If you just felt a slight tingle, I have a few questions for you. Questions for future billionaires.1. What’s your good reason for wanting to make a billion?I like David Blaine’s idea that success is giving as much as you get.He says what makes Bill Gates so great is that he’s figured out how to give the money he’s amassed to worthy causes better than most institutions can. Polio’s almost eradicated. Next, he’s going after Guinea worm disease.If the only place you want to direct the money is into your own pocket, you’ll never think broad enough to reach a billion.“To make a billion dollars, help a billion people.” – Peter Diamandis2. What’s your real reason for wanting to make a billion?Now that we’ve got the noble cause out of the way, why do you really need the money? What happiness can a billion buy you that 100 million can’t? That 10 million can’t? That one million can’t?It’s just another arbitrary number. What’s not arbitrary is the psychological hole you’re hoping it’ll fill. Where’s the hole?Are you insecure? Lonely? Do you lack self-worth? Self-love? Who do you want to prove wrong? Yourself? The world?It’s okay. Just like the idea of becoming a billionaire itself, when you dig deep enough, you’ll realize it’s there. We all have it. But know it’s there.“There’s always a good reason and there’s always a real reason.” – James Altucher3. How are you going to make your billion?Seriously. Do the math. The real, serious math. We’re not talking about revenue here. We’re talking about profit. Profit you can pocket.What does a billionaires bank account even look like? Is there ever a billion on there? I have no idea. And neither do you.Only 3% of billionaires made their money from running private companies. Can you take a company from zero to IPO? How big is your total market? Is there even a billion in there?“If past history was all there was to the game, the richest people would be librarians.”– Warren Buffett4. Who’s going to make your billion for you?That’s right. Not with you. For you. You have to be aware that in the end, that’s what’s happening. Everyone you hire along your journey will partly be responsible for making your billion. And you will hire people. You have to.These people will work with you. But they’ll make money for you. Tell me: Why should they? Tell them. You better have a compelling reason. A good offer.What are you going to give back? What are you going to do for them?“Help young people. Help small guys. Because small guys will be big.” – Jack Ma5. When do you expect your billion?If the answer is anything less than 20 years from now, you can stop right here. Warren Buffett became a millionaire just before turning 30. He first was a billionaire at 56. That’s 26 years, starting from millionaire status.Are you a millionaire yet? No? Whoops. That’s just the first part. But even that’s ridiculously hard.And don’t you dare tell me about Mark Zuckerberg. You’re not Mark Zuckerberg. Mark Zuckerberg isn’t reading this. Neither would you be, if you were already seriously working on your billion.“I’m here to build something for the long-term. Anything else is a distraction.” – Mark Zuckerberg6. What are you willing to give up for your billion?If being a billionaire is your number one goal, think about number two. You will not get number two. Or three. Or four. The bigger the goal, the bigger the sacrifice.0.0000272% of all humans are billionaires. They gave up not one, but all the things that make the other 99.99% of people what they are - the other 99.99% of the people.Whatever you think you can also have, next to being a billionaire, you most likely can’t. We’re not talking about giving up watching football here.Are you willing to be a bad father for your billion? An absent mother? Are you willing to lose your girlfriend? Or all your friends? Would you give up family? Sleep? Food for a week?Most importantly: Are you willing to give up being understood by every single person you know?“I was set free, because my greatest fear had already been realized, and I was still alive, and I still had a daughter whom I adored, and I had an old typewriter and a big idea. And so rock bottom became the solid foundation on which I rebuilt my life.” – J.K. RowlingPrivilege is a sweet syrup. There’s lots to gain from savoring it. Delusion is the bitter taste it leaves in your mouth when you get used to it.So here’s one last piece of bark to chew on. As of 2017, there are 2,043 billionaires in the world.How many of them do you think started with dreaming about being a billionaire?Sources[1] Fear{less} with Tim Ferriss[2] 2015 Gates Annual Letter[3] American Billionaires And Their Private Company Fortunes[4] The Age When 17 Self-Made Billionaires Earned Their First Million[Image] Warren Buffett is 'one-quarter Coca-Cola'PS: I write more articles like this one each week and send them out in Nik’s Newsletter.

201,"There was this tech fest at NIT Trichy. We registered for a workshop on ‘Quadcopters’. The description given was ‘Hands on training’ with a takeaway kit.<Similar to the one they show in 3 idiots>The workshop was offered by a private company. The company even promised to support us with advancements and developments after the workshop through regular emails.The fee for the workshop was 6000 Rs. for 5 people (as a team). It was for two days.We went earlier and the crowd there was overwhelming.2 freakishly dressed guys entered the hall.They introduced themselves as teachers.The morning session was a lecture on aerodynamics and how airplanes worked. By lecture, I mean the guy was reading from his PowerPoint slides. Not more than 10% of the class listened to it. Aahhh, even if you teach in Gibberish language, I'll listen to it. I've paid.The afternoon session started with distributing the kit for the quadcopter. 2 wooden planks were given to make the chassis of the quad (the base frame) . They explained nothing. They said to drill holes at specific points and to fasten the two wooden planks with screws. We screwed.That's it. The day was over.Next day, they gave us a microcontroller and the sensors. I was eager for this part. Coding for a quadcopter felt awesome.They gave us some files in a pendrive. It had the code. They told us to just upload the code.What ? That's it ? No programming ?They then made us wait for a few hours.We were still excited for the next part. Assembling a battery, the motors, the blades, the remote control and all.They made all of the teams to sit near the ground outside the hall. The teams were called one by one. After 3 hours of doing nothing, our turn came.They had only one set of motors, battery and the remote control for more than 200 students.A team of 3 guys, who were also dressed freakishly, asked for our chassis. They assembled the motor, the wings, the battery and everything. We simply had to watch it.Why on earth is this called a hands on workshop ?We dreamt of atleast flying it. That's when they poisoned our dreamsA guy who held a remote control, made the quad fly.“Students, your quadcopter is flying. Take video guys”, He said to us.I was furious. We did not pay to take a video. We paid to learn how to do it.It did not end there. They issued us certificates. Most students left.We were waiting for the takeaway kit. When we asked them, they said to take the wooden planks alone.Even worse is their continuous support through email. I've received 7 mails from them so far. One of them was a digital certificate and the other 6 were ads for their next workshops.The students didn't demand anything from them, as they got an NIT workshop certificate. I still have no clue, what on Earth are they going to do with that certificate.These private companies use the 'Workshops are conducted in IITs and NITs' tag to make money from other college students.In an era where, Khan Academy and Unacademy are giving free courses to students, some people tend to make money out of students' ignorance and curiosity.The colleges where the workshops are hosted should take efforts to ensure certain quality parameters.This scam on a scale across all the colleges in India would amount proportional to the other 'well to do' scams in our country.Edit 1 : Whoa. From the comments, it seems a large number of people were affected by this scam.Jayasuriya Rs"
202,"Hi, I unapologetically am copy and pasting this answer I've been posting over Quora because I believe it gives a good answer, motive, and inspiration for starting robotics. Following this stream of development will land you to a solid position in the future. Most people will suggest Arduinos, here is my argument against that.*** Self advertisement as this gets over 2k views/week (Edit): I’m now taking on contract development work! Message me if you have opportunities available. (noobaca2@gmail.com) *** Thank you and continue on to the post!I wish I could post the same answer as i did to another post. But contrary to what all these old folk are saying about robotics, Arduinos are NOT robotics! Just because you know how to program a microcontroller or know how an analog circuit works, doesn't mean you know diddly squat about robotics, the software architecture (which is a fancy two word thing for saying how the main ideas of a robot can fit together in a puzzle)An Arduino will not:- show you how to integrate multiple sensor and data feeds- actuate sequences of motorcontrollers via inverse kinematics solutions- do autonomous navigation by bringing together many low level peripherals- teach you about differential drives required to move a mobile baseWhat an Arduino is:- a tool for communicating with peripherals.- limited, stupid, a basic input output board (just like the people who talk about how they're also a robot)If you keep going down the route that all of these baboons on Quora I keep for some reason saying go down about Arduinos, Microcontrollers, PLCs, etc, you will end up just like them.. 30 years later and still having not built an actual robot.Now, I'll copy and paste what I've been throwing around out here a lot:No, Arduino is not a good place to learn robotics. Sure, you will learn how to control a servo or blink an LED. This is not robotics, it is programmable logic. If you think learning how to program an Arduino is going to teach you how to make a robot, that is equivalent to saying learning how to write a mouse driver is going to teach you how to build a computer.You will want to look at the Robot Operating System and begin with the tutorials there (see rest of post for links) You will want to get familiar with simulators Tutorials : Installation, real world architectures vs simulation architectures.. etc, and work from a top down view.The robot operating system Powering the world's robots is a essentially a filesystem that will let you organize all of your robotics code.Why start with software, and not hardware? In simulation, and with the way the Robot Operating System is organized, you WILL learn how to interface with simulated controllers and how to actuate simulated robots, and be able to put entire systems together. A long story short, a robot is essentially a local area network of sensors and actuators connected by physical joints in usually, a tree like structure. You will shortly realize that Arduino is just a device used to communicate to hardware, and the real stuff is done by learning the ideas that software organizes.With the Robot Operating System, I have learned to program and write software for the PR2 robotThe Husky Mobile manipulation robotand the Talos mobile manipulation system being developed at UBC Open RoboticsThe only time I have ever encountered an Arduino was because we needed to interface with a motor for the mobile base in the Talos robot. It was like 100 lines of code out of a 10k+ LOC project. Most importantly, you should start with something small and keep prying.I would start with the very thorough Turtlebot tutorials which can be run in simulation, found at: Learn TurtleBot and ROSYou can even get the Husky Mobile Manipulation robot up and running which will get you an arm moving around in simulation (you can whack things!) husky_ur5_moveit_config/Tutorials/Husky UR5 Mobile ..."
203,"As a woman in politics, you’re expected to be tough. Otherwise, you’re just a girl, and you should go back to cooking, or whatever.Hillary Clinton’s persona took that toughness to a new level.The result is that she doesn’t make anyone feel warm and fuzzy inside.I’ve penned more than my fair share of Hillary Clinton defenses on here, but she never excited me. And I have some residual anger at her, left over from the racist campaign she waged against Obama in 2008.The North remembers.In any case, people dislike her for different reasons:It’s hard for people to see it that way now, but many on the right saw her as unacceptably liberal. She was the poster child for a certain kind of unapologetic feminism. You can see it here in her “could have stayed home and baked cookies” statement, given in response to a rude question from a reporter:There were all kinds of right wing conspiracy theories against the Clintons in the 90s. When people are subjected to such a barrage of negativity, a perception that some of it must have been deserved sets in. The barrage of conspiracy theories against Hillary basically never stopped. It’s impossible to be an American Conservative and not have absorbed at least some of it.She is a pragmatist. If she supports gay rights but the rest of the country doesn’t support it, she’ll support advancing gay rights as far as politically feasible. She’s not going to campaign on idealism that she has no chance of enacting into policy. Some people view that as exceedingly calculating and untrustworthy.She is very pro-military intervention. A lot of people on the left dislike that.She is too comfortable with the big Banks. A lot of liberals, especially those of my generation, really, really, really don’t like that.I think those are the main reasons, as I see it."
204,"Are classes that factor in participation during group discussions biased against those who are more thorough, yet slower, thinkers? (Such as the student wants time to develop opinions, yet once they make up their mind, the discussion has moved on.)"
205,"There is no real difference between your two definitions. Atheism means ""lacking a belief in god"" because ""a"" means ""without"" and ""theism"" means ""belief in god"". Therefore it is generally considered more accurate (more respectful to the root of the word) to say ""without a belief"". To most atheists there is something awkward about saying you believe in a nullity. At the very best saying ""I believe there is no god"" is poor grammar. A bit like saying... ""Mum: do you not know where my socks are?""But if you lack a belief in god then you believe there is no god. The term is atheism for both your descriptions.   Hard AtheistIf someone believes there is no god with certainty then you could say they are a hard atheist. I sometimes use the term myself because it seems to mean something to people. Some atheists are likely to disagree with me about this, but even though I do use it myself, I think the term hard atheist is next to useless. Not useless as such; but next to useless - uselessish. I will come back to that point, and at the same time take issue with this idea that you can lack a belief in god with certainty.Gnostic AtheistI suggest you don't use this term. I would argue (am arguing) gnostic atheist is also being used incorrectly. Take for example the chart found in Jim Ashby's discussion of atheism and agnosticism on Quora's Atheist FAQ [1]. The chart suggests that a gnostic atheist claims to know god does not exist - i.e. has knowledge of it. That seems like a pretty awkward definition to me - and an even dumber position. Are there really any atheists like that? Agnosticism is the position that nothing is known, or can be known of the existence or nature of god. It's therefore true to say that if an atheist is certain there is no god, then you could not call them agnostic. The opposite, gnostic, means a person who thinks they do have knowledge of god. Sometimes you'll see the term gnostic atheist being used to mean ""an atheist who claims to know there is no god"". But that isn't truly what gnostic means (see below). Strictly speaking gnostic means ""knowledge of god"" - not, ""knowledge of no god"". The latter is - to me - an oxymoron.So I put my version of Barry Hampe's challenge out there: If you can present credible, objective, verifiable evidence that no gods -- supernatural entities associated with a religion -- actually exist, I'll immediately stop being an atheist and become a gnostic atheist.Wavering TheistsI'm not convinced lacking a belief in god can be on some weird scale of soft --> hard certainty. If you are an atheist , you are an atheist. What further definition is required? And why?You see, when you say ""does not believe in god with certainty"", I have to question what you mean by that. How certain? Absolute certainty would be a delusion for any rational person in my opinion. That would be a tipping point into insanity.The point atheists regularly make about this is pertinent, and so it bears repeating. To the same extent as any theist or sane person, I believe there can never be, and will never be, evidence for unicorns or dragons (to use the tired old examples). I believe we will never find an actual skeleton of a dragon in a cave with scorch marks. Would you call me an especially fervent disbeliever of dragons for that reason? Surely if someone thinks there may be dragons we would just call this wishful thinking?It's the same thing - my disbelief in dragons and unicorns and fairies and god. I don't have a special disbelief in gods because I'm an atheist. Just because there is a special word for that disbelief doesn't make it special to me. It makes it special to the billions of people who do believe in god. The word atheist only exists as a numbers game.So, I'm certain there are no dragons or gods (like you I hope) ...       ... but you never know. I'd prefer not have custard on my face. One day someone might fin..."
206,"Jack was great. I loved working with him. And he also taught me an important management lesson.We worked together at Odeo, which is where Jack built the first version of Twitter. He was an engineer and I was his boss, the VP of Engineering.When I joined Odeo, most of the team was already in place including Jack. There was a lot of confusion about whether I was there to help scale the team or whether we were wrong and needed to start pivoting.I think we experimented with at least six different pivots.One of the problems with not having clarity was that it was really hard to manage that team. Several of them weren't getting along and were acting out. But I didn't know enough about what we were doing to just fire any of them.So I spent most of my time trying to massage people's egos.However, during all of this Jack was perfect. He came in early, got his work done, volunteered for work that other people didn't want to do. He had a strong sense of duty and would work on messy code in any language.There was a key piece of infrastructure that was hacked together by one of the founders. It ran on a single desktop computer sitting in our server cage. This thing broke all the time and Jack was the only one willing to fix it.Given that, I didn't really need to spend much time managing Jack. I supported a raise and voted him some bonuses. But mostly I was working with the other people because they were causing a lot of headaches.I spent enough time with those trouble people that I consider several of them friends. But they were difficult anarchists back then. One of them sent me an apology note years later. He found a photo from one of our standup meetings where he'd refused to stand. That was his idea of anarchy.And I think that's a big management lesson--it's easy to get sucked in to spending all your time with the hard cases. If I could do it over, I would have spent more time with Jack. It's not that he needed managing. But I think he could have had an even easier time getting his viewpoint across if I'd spent more time supporting him.I do have a couple of anecdotes about Jack from those days.He definitely had a sparse sense of design. You could tell he was already thinking about focus and simplicity, especially in his own life. He only owned a few things, but those things were all of the highest quality.One day I asked him for advice about a gift. I wanted to get my mom something cashmere. Jack's eyes lit up and he got very excited telling me about a boutique that specialized in cashmere. So I went to this boutique. It was deep in some alley--I never would have found this myself. And it was the most expensive clothing store I'd ever been in. The cheapest thing there was a pair of $200 cashmere mittens. That was Jack.The thing I don't remember is why we all thought Twitter was such a good idea. As I recall, we jumped on it really early, even before we had a prototype.I think part of the issue was that most of us weren't yet on Facebook. So we didn't have a way to keep in touch with our friends.So when we had a version that was friends and family only, we all had a magical experience of feeling connected to our friends.My job during the very early days of Twitter was mostly to keep massaging the issues with the engineering team. Twitter was too small to have the whole team working on it. We also didn't know if Twitter was going to be a real thing on its own. So my job was mostly to keep Jack safe from distraction. Once I had to yell at someone who had kept trying to check in fixes to the code. But mostly, I was organizing the rest of the team to work on other Odeo projects.A story that I've never seen told was about sailing.Rabble, one of the other engineers, had bought a boat and needed to sail it down the delta to a dock he was renting in Berkeley. He asked for volunteers and said it was supposed to take half a day. Jack and Noah volunteered to help him on a Saturday.When the three of them came to work on Monday they were beet red, dehydrated and looked like they'd been stranded on a desert island.They'd managed to run the boat aground.Jack, who actually knows how to sail, was below deck getting changed. And he could hear Rabble and Noah speculating about the signs they were seeing on the delta. ""10? What does 10 mean?"" ""5? What does 5 mean?""Boom. Five means five feet. The boat ran aground and they were stuck there for awhile. Everyone who came to help treated them like morons. But that was a great anecdote for that team. Noah and Rabble were up for winging it. Jack was up for adventure, but he never would have run aground because he was so detail oriented."
207,"A select few quotes from the Assassin's Creed franchise are very profound indeed and leave a lasting impact in the minds of the audience. I'll quote them in the no particular order whatsoever (the ones in bold are my personal favorites):1. A good life (AC2)Federico: ""It is a good life we lead, brother.""Ezio: ""The best. May it never change.""Federico: ""And may it never change us.""(The music and title screen following it is an act of genius.)2. Ezio's last letter to Sofia (AC Embers)""When I was a young man, I had liberty, but I did not see it. I had time, but I did not know it. And I had love, but I did not feel it.

The Creed's maxim (AC1)""Nothing is True, Everything is Permitted.""4. Al Mualim quoting the Bible (AC1)""I applied my heart to know wisdom, and to know madness and folly.

But I know you are listening. (he leaves his weapons) I have lived my life as best I could, not knowing its purpose, but drawn forward like a moth to a distant moon. And here, at last, I discover a strange truth. That I am only a conduit for a message that eludes my understanding. Who are we, who have been so blessed to share our stories like this? To speak across centuries? Maybe you will answer all the questions I have asked. Maybe you will be the one to make all this suffering worth something in the end.""6. Arno's closing monologue (AC5 Unity)""The Creed of the Assassin Brotherhood teaches us that nothing is forbidden to us. Once, I thought that meant we were free to do as we would. To pursue our ideals, no matter the cost. I understand now. Not a grant of permission. The Creed is a warning. Ideals too easily give way to dogma. Dogma becomes fanaticism. No higher power sits in judgement of us. No supreme being watches to punish us for our sins. In the end, only we ourselves can guard against our obsessions. Only we can decide whether the road we walk carries too high a toll. We believe ourselves redeemers, avengers, saviours. We make war on those who oppose us, and they in turn make war on us. We dream of leaving our stamp upon the world... even as we give our lives in a conflict that will be recorded in no history book. All that we do, all that we are, begins and ends with ourselves.""7.

208,"If the print is pure black and white, and the printer has a dedicated black cartridge, it should just use the black ink. I can think of two things that might use more color ink than you might expect:First, every time the inkjet gets ready to print, it will prime and clean the printheads. It does that to ensure they aren't clogged and ink will flow freely as needed. It will do this on all colors, even if you only print black. This uses some ink.Second, if you are printing monochrome gray scale images (say a black and white photo on the page), the printer might use color inks in order to get more shades of gray. Higher end photo printers have black and gray ink so they can print high quality black and white photos without using the color cartridges. They often have light and dark cyan and magenta inks also for smoother color blending."
209,"Let me explain this with a simple example. Creativity can be linked to coming up with different solutions for a problem. It is about understanding the Problems, not Solutions.Sometimes it pays to dig a little deeper to find out what your customers really need.A young man walks into a hardware store looking to buy a hammer, but they are sold out. “What did you need the hammer for?” asked the proprietor. The man looked at him quizzically. “To hammer in some nails of course. Why else would I want a hammer?”The store owner persists with another question. What were you trying to hammer in with the nails? “A shelf” the man replied. “Good” said the proprietor. Maybe these will be of use instead - we have a nail free wall glue in stock as well as free hanging shelves - would either be useful instead?So you see, the customer is satisfied and the shop keeper just was creative enough to sell his product.It is left to you as to how creative you can be. Creativity cannot be taught but you just have to let your thoughts flow!"
210,"If Hillary Clinton could not continue her Presidential campaign how would the Democratic Party choose a new candidate?The DNC would quickly appoint another candidate, probably by informal teleconferencing, and delegate the final decision and announcement to the DNC Chairperson. Clinton’s running mate, Tim Kaine, would receive first consideration. I think.True, the full DNC consists of over 200 members in 50 states, but most likely the quorum for an emergency meeting is only a small fraction of the full list.The DNC is not terribly transparent online, but it may also be the case that the committee gives it’s Chairperson emergency authority between conventions."
211,"An antennae is a metallic conductor. Headphones are insulated metal wire with a coil surrounding a magnet at one end and a thick metal jack at the other. It works as an antennae by picking up the energy in a radio wave, an oscillating electric current, and supplying it to a tuner.FM radio works in the range of 85 - 100 MHz (approximately). Antennae length is proportional to the wavelength of reception. If the frequency is ~85 MHz, the antennae length would be around 35 inches(a quarter of wavelength for whip antennae). Most earphones are greater than or about that length and are a good alternative to an inbuilt antennae.Most mobile phone purchase includes basic earphones. Even if  cellphones include inbuilt antennae, user will be using earphones most of the time or at least they will have an option of using earphones. In such case either one of the two antennae- inbuilt or external earphone- will be serving the same purpose diminishing the inbuilt antenna's worth. Earphones are not optional, inbuilt antennas are.Inbuilt radio antennae will make a phone bulkier by few grams and would increase the thickness of the phone, not a desirable attribute for marketing.To know more about  antennae :Antenna (radio) (wiki article)Page on Howstuffworks (how radio works)Page on Public (an algorithm on minimum antennae length)Whip antenna (wiki article)Using headset as cell phone radio antenna. (electronics point forum)** There are some cell phones with inbuilt antenna like  Nokia 5030, Nokia X2-02 etc."
212,"As you have experience in testing you must be knowing that there are two aspects of software testing:1. Functional testing    Where we focus on the actual functionality of the software2. Non-functional testing    Where we focus on the non functional parameters of a software e.g. load testing, stress testing, performance testing.There are automation tools to cater the need of both the aspects.It is advisable to have a knowledge of both the kinds of tools.You can learn the following combinations:1. HP suit (vbsvript)QTP for functionalLoadrunner for non functional2. Open source (Java)Selenium for functionalJMeter for non functionalThese are the two most popular options as they have huge marker share and lots of job opportunities.Apart from these tools there are many other popular tools like IBM RFT(Java), Microsoft VSTS (c#).Now a days with the boom of mobile market, mobile testing is emerging, there are many options for mobile test automation. E.g. cucumber, robotium, silk test, appiumIt depends on your choice, the language you are comfortable with. Professional guidence is available for almost all of them. It is marginally less for mobile tools though.Open source tools can be learnt by your own and for fres. But for proprietary tools you will require licenced version.Before joining any classes for proprietary tools like qtp, RFT or vsts do consider this point as getting them on your home PC for practice is difficult."
213,"Every company is in need of money to grow and expand its business. They can do this by going public, which means by issuing shares, which people can buy. This first issue of shares offered by the company to raise capital (money) is called as an Initial Public Offering (IPO). Thus, IPO is the means by which a company gets listed in the stock market (and hence in indices such as BSE and NSE).Every investor owning some shares gets the ownership of the company proportionate to the amount of shares the investor holds. The exchange where this company gets listed is the place where you buy/sell the shares of this company.By this point you may think that it is a win-win for a company to go public, and there are absolutely no drawbacks. But this is wrong. A company going public (getting listed in BSE/NSE) has its own drawbacks as well. Some of them are as follows:The most important drawback is that a company needs to disclose additional information to its investors. This may seem to be a small thing, but is a very big deal.They need to comply to a lot of rules and regulations chalked out by SEC (Securities and Exchange Commission). The cost of complying to these regulations is quite high and might be a pain for new companies.Added pressure of performing in the market limits the company to short term goals rather than long term big wins and growth.Company becomes answerable to a lot of people and faces scrutiny for its wrong doing or lack of performance. This happens because investors always want to make profits after they put their hard-earned money in the company.The penalty for any wrong doing becomes huge.Due to all these reasons, any company thinks 10 times before going public by means of an IPO.Hope this information helps.Happy investing!"
214,"That’s an excellent question. But I doubt if it has an answer. Macro sized objects are made of atoms and molecules that behave somewhat independently. When you strike a billiard ball with a cue it doesn’t move as a whole, a shockwave passes through it so the atoms near the cue move first and the motion spreads through the ball. To a first approximation you might be able to imagine a single wave spreading out from the area of contact, but it’s probably a lot more complicated with interference from reflected waves resulting in fairly random vibrations that we call heat.Of course all this happens over such a short time period so we can usually approximate the blow as an impulse. A more detailed analysis gives us the average acceleration of the molecules over a tiny time interval. In that case the jerk would be indeterminate. With steady acceleration one could analyse the jerk, but there will be a maximum number of derivatives that can be analysed in practice.However, in the ideal world of the mathematician where rigid bodies are truly rigid there are no constraints. You can have instantaneous changes of velocity and nothing need be assumed continuous. That’s why impulses were invented (along with supersonic shockwaves where the air density changes suddenly). Although the ideal world doesn’t exist, that doesn’t mean it isn’t useful."
215,"A Neutron star is a collapsed supernova remnant that is too large to be a White dwarf.  And not dense enough to become a Black Hole.In general, compact stars of less than 1.39 M☉ (the Chandrasekhar limit) are white dwarfs, whereas compact stars with a mass between 1.4 M☉ and 3 M☉ (the Tolman–Oppenheimer–Volkoff limit) should be neutron stars. The maximum observed mass of neutron stars is about 2 M☉. The smallest observed mass of a stellar black hole is about 5 M☉, though compact stars with more than 10 M☉ will overcome the neutron degeneracy pressure and gravitational collapse will usually occur to produce a black hole.[9] Between 3 M☉ and 5 M☉, hypothetical intermediate-mass stars such as quark stars and electroweak stars have been proposed, but none have been shown to exist. The equations of  state of matter at such high densities are not precisely known because  of the theoretical and empirical difficulties.It's thought that Neutron Stars are indeed composed almost entirely of neutrons, but may have 'quark soup' or other complexities.  They definitely exist and some of them are pulsars.  Too small to be White Dwarves - which are made up of collapsed matter, still normal atoms.  And not black holes either.This is not 100% certain.  Some time back, I saw a suggestion that all of the neutrons actually transmute to Strange Particles - see Strangeness."
216,"No. A 3.8 is fine. Harvard regularly accepts students with a 3.8. That may sound surprising because Harvard rejects students with higher GPAs, but a 3.8 isn’t much different than a 4.0, and most schools don’t have a 4.3 grading range.The 3.8 student may win out based on SAT scores, extracurriculars, awards, the essay, and personal factors.Even a student with a lower GPA will at least have the other factors looked at, though it may be a quick look. Say a student with a 2.5 applies. What?! Who would dare apply with such a low GPA??? Before rejecting the application, though, the admissions people might see that the student has an SAT of 1540 and spent two of his high school years doing fundraising projects to get medical care for his dad who had cancer, and working to help support the family. He wrote an impressive essay and got letters of recommendation from his teachers confirming his potential and determination.My point is, whatever your GPA, they will look at your entire application and not just reject you based on your GPA."
217,"To start, let’s be clear: you can make money binary options trading. It’s definitely possible to generate a consistent profit. Smart traders do it every day, executing binaries in everything from oil and gold to stocks and currency pairs.I’ll give you a few tips to get you started. By following these you can start earning money by trading:Learn how to read candlestick chartsStudy the past price activity of your chosen underlying assets.Watch and follow pricing trends.Don’t bet your mortgage payment.Get some experience before risking a sizable piece of your cash flow.Types Of People Trade Binary OptionsTry to identify the category that best describes you.The first is The Gambler. This individual approaches binary options trading in the same way he approaches a roulette wheel. To him, whether he profits or not is based entirely on chance (e.g. red versus black). Hence, he doesn’t look at candlestick charts, pays no attention to pivot points, and couldn’t care less about Fibonacci retracements.In the second category we find The Investor. This individual looks at trading binaries as a method to “juice up” the return on his investment portfolio. If someone were to ask him about the things he invests in, he might respond, “IBM, Google, muni bonds, and some binary options trading.” Investors often fail to realize the high degree of risk they assume as they chase the high returns advertised by binary options brokers.The third category is made up of traders who are realistic. These folks typically have experience, and are well aware of the risks associated with trading binaries. They also know that having a keen grasp of the assets that underlie the options, and a familiarity with certain aspects of technical analysis, gives them an edge. And with that edge, they know they can consistently make money trading binary options.Beware of scam binary option brokersFor more information on how to earn good money on Trading binary go to …….

218,Best depression medicine in my view is to listen to soft and soothing music. You can watch those movies that you always wanted to but never had time.If you already play a musical instrument then you can try to compose a beautiful song.Another way to make yourself happy is to keep a pet at home. Playing with a puppy will make you happy.Little children can be another medicine for depression. Play with them. Help them in their studies or project work. Teach them for a fee. Busy mind doesn’t have time for depression.You can enroll for some language courses or online courses of your choice and interest. Use your free time to build a foundation for better future.

220,"Ah! If there ever were a question just for me, this one is is probably it.I’ve been making a significant, mostly passive income from Quora for about a year now. Admittedly, I only stumbled into it.I had only discovered Quora just a few months prior. I was working a summer internship in a city separate from most of my friends, so I had a lot of spare time on my hands. Having always been a voracious reader, Quora kept me up a bit too late many or most work nights that summer.At some point, I began to feel a little guilty learning so many amazing things from other people and not giving back myself. So, I started writing answers to questions in the e-commerce and distribution space. I had been working independently in e-commerce for 8 years, and my internship was at a Fortune 200 distribution company.It’s worth noting that the thought of putting so much effort into writing these posts with the potential to reach tens, even hundreds of thousands of people made me super nervous at first. The first few times I hit submit, I immediately stood up and paced around a bit to shake it off.While most of my initial answers received very little attention, one blew up. The response (upvotes, comments) was tremendously positive. It was a great feeling.Around the same time, I was also reading quite a bit about affiliate marketing. I knew what it was all about from previous reading. After all, I had spent 8 years selling physical products online.For those of you not familiar, affiliate marketing allows you to make a commission selling other people and company’s products online, without actually fulfilling product orders or serving customers. You just have to make the introduction. You don’t have to be hired. You just post a link to the product or service that is unique to you, and software tracks any sales that result from your recommendation. The software knows that buyer purchased after clicking your link.Finally, I decided to give it a shot. There were services I was already mentioning and linking to in my answers that had affiliate programs themselves, so I swapped my links out for affiliate links.Within 30 minutes, I made one $30 commission.I immediately did the math to calculate how much more money I would make that day. $30 every 30 minutes… 12 hours left in the day… Holy #$%^!!!I didn’t make a penny more that day. But over the course of the next couple weeks, I did quite well.As it turns out, you can’t just drop affiliate links wherever you please and without disclosure. It violates Quora’s policy, and disclosure of affiliate links is required by the Federal Trade Commission.This goes for most 3rd party platforms like facebook, LinkedIn, Medium, and reddit as well— even though you create and contribute the content yourself.Now, if you still want to make money from affiliate marketing on these platforms, the key is to build blogs relevant to what you are writing about. That way, you own the platform and what kind of links you post are up to my discretion (so long as affiliate relationships are disclosed).Then you can post really informative, helpful content on 3rd party platforms like facebook groups, Quora, and reddit to cultivate an audience. From that content you can link to supplementary resources on your blog where you are free to use affiliate links and earn commissions. If that content is great as well, people will continue to read your content, use your links to support you financially, and share with friends.Let’s explore an example of how this works in practice:Did you know many credit card companies offer 0% interest as an introductory rate for the first X months of having their credit card? Did you know credit card companies also pay hefty affiliate commissions for successful referrals?During my senior year of college, I was a little strapped for cash. I had money, but most of it was tied up in my online businesses and/or stocks. However, I had a job lined up for after graduation, so I knew I would have cash coming in soon.All of my friends were taking senior vacations. I didn’t want to ask my parents for money— they had covered enough.So, I opened a few credit cards with 0% interest for 6–9 months. During the second semester of my senior year, I partied through an online marketing conference in Vegas, visited a friend in NYC, went skiing in Colorado, searched for housing in KC, and spent a weekend at the lake.I paid the cards off in the first couple months after graduation using my salary.Now, it’s not the smartest financial decision I’ve ever made, but I’m not the only college student who would enjoy living it up a bit during senior year despite a lack of funds.How can I make money on that?Easy. Tell the story around Reddit, facebook groups, Quora, Medium… Link from those posts to a blog post titled something like “Top 10 Credit Cards Offering 0% Interest.” That blog post would compare the pros and cons of each, and link to applications using, you guessed it, affiliate links. Links to credit cards paying me $50, $100, even $150+ for a signup.Again, it doesn’t stop there. Readers will enjoy the content. They will share with friends. They will come back for more helpful content again and again, assuming I keep it coming.Building the blogs themselves is a piece of cake these days. Here’s a 5-minute how-to. You don’t need to know how to code, you don’t need to be an expert designer— even the writing is made easier with tools like Hemmingway App.You can find affiliate products and services to promote with a simple google search. There are a lot of spammy products out there which are no good for your readers, nor your reputation.While many companies run their own affiliate programs independently, many utilize affiliate networks to manage the link tracking and connect with people who will promote their products. Affiliate networks are great places for you to find products and services you can promote.Here are just a few:Amazon: That’s right! Amazon has an affiliate program for nearly everything listed. Commissions vary. The interesting thing about Amazon is that you will not earn commissions solely on what you link a reader to, but everything they purchase in the next 24 hours!Share-a-Sale: Home to more than 3,900 affiliate programs— Share-a-Sale is sure to have something for your niche. Not only do their advertisers, pay for referred sales, many pay for clicks and ‘leads’ too. My personal favorite.Rakuten: One of the oldest networks around. Rakuten is known for its intuitive interface and over 1,000 advertisers, including many well-known brands.FlexOffers: Many well-known companies use this network, including Macy’s, HP, and Hallmark, along with a variety of lesser known companies.Commission Junction: Probably the #1 affiliate network overall, CJ is home to many of your household names. Credit cards, banks, insurance, security, real estate, fashion, you name it. Because there are so many big name advertisers here, competition can be stiff. You may actually have to apply for programs, and your site will be held to a higher standard.To sign up for a network or affiliate program, you will want to opt in as a ‘publisher’ (‘advertisers’ are who you promote for). Most will require that you provide a link to your blog. Again, you can set up a blog in very little time (video tutorial here). Hosting your blog will cost just less than $1/day, or 66 cents if you pay annually.If you provide good content for people, not only can you expect affiliate commissions, but generally people will reach out to you for consulting, coaching, friendship, business propositions, and more, depending on what you write about.Plus, anytime you have influence like that, there’s always the opportunity to sell your own info product, for which you can recruit other affiliates to sell for you.Best of luck!BONUS: I’m trying to get out of my comfort zone and do more public speaking of sorts. Recently, I did a podcast with Google Product Strategist, Sonali Mangal. As it turns out, getting a lot of exposure on Quora is a bit of a science. You can’t just write an answer and expect lots of views. Sonali and I discussed what works and what doesn’t on Quora. Listen here and enjoy!"

When there is no grand prize winner in a lottery the prize rolls over and dollars are added.That grand prize keeps growing. However for it to reach a billion it means the lottery needs to go may weeks sans winner.On the other hand it is surprising the interest in that big number.

225,"Scary as any other narrow two-lane, unmarked road. Wet conditions should be taken with caution. Also when coming around a bend, take a look at the other side of the valley to be aware of another car approaching from the other way. The bridges are narrow so sometimes it's best to wait on your side of the bridge and allow the other (maybe larger) vehicle to go first. Reversing on a narrow road or bridge is tricky.. I banged up my dad's car once doing this. So really, just be aware of everyone else on the road and take it slow... you'll get to Hana eventually :)"

231,"Patients with kidney stones are often told to aim for 2 L of urine output a day. Considering you lose water while breathing, and in stool, and in sweat, 4 L is perfectly ok for many people (without a predisposition to retain water, kidney problems, or unusual diets). But that can't be routinely recommended without details. Think about getting rid of water. When you drink water, it dilutes your blood plasma, lowering the osmolality. This is sensed by the brain, which turns off a hormone called ADH or AVP. The absence of the hormone tells your kidney to release all the water it filters. But, to get water out, you have to get the water through the kidney filtration tube and out into the urine without being reabsorbed. So there has to be a sufficient filtration rate, and you have to have a healthy kidney which can reclaim salts while allowing the water to escape in urine. Healthy kidneys can remove almost all the salt in urine, but not all, and less healthy kidneys can't filter as much urine OR reclaim the salts in it. Thus, there is an obligate salt loss with urine output. If you keep losing salt in urine and don't consume enough (psychotic people can do this (psychogenic polydipsia) or alcoholics (beer potomania) or just frail elderly people with low salt diets (tea and toast syndrome)), your plasma sodium MUST drop, and the eventual result is that your brain cells will be exposed to a low salt environment. Water will move from the blood into the brain to equalize the difference. The brain swells, impairing function, and that can result in headaches, confusion, stupor, coma, and death. Some examples: excessive water challenges (Woman dies after being in water-drinking contest), or, sports. I have seen people with acute hyponatremia after drinking during a marathon (so they were losing salty sweat and replacing with mostly water presumably). Check out the last case mentioned at the end of the Wiki article: Water intoxication. That person had dangerous intoxication after daily consumption of 8 L, but he was probably a pretty healthy guy, and so an ill person could get sick at a lower dose.Conversely, some people cannot concentrate their urine or have high sweating losses or diarrhea etc. For them, drinking 4L daily might be required for survival! If their losses are mostly water, water would be a good replacement fluid; if they're losing sweat and diarrhea, they have to replace with salt containing solutions like WHO rehydration fluid: Oral rehydration therapy.In short, the answer is ""probably, but it depends,"" and the larger question is ""why would you do that?"" In general you can just drink to thirst. Avoid dehydration but don't kill yourself (literally) to drink lots more water than you need. "

It’s because what other people’s thoughts are, are what build us up as a person. When someone breaks that system with something we haven’t heard of before, we either get defensive or feel insecure.This insecurity makes us wonder if the good things the other people have stacked up for us is….actually true. What if there are others who had built us up who were actually lying. What if this new mean “thing” is stronger than what I’m built up on?All these new scary concepts burst out from our brain and we suppress our self-happiness.After a while, we move on and keep building up our happiness.

236,"Well this is a simple process as long as you put in your time to chalk out a routine that matches your pup’s daily routine. Having a pup at home is like having a baby in the house except that they grow up quickly :PGenerally these young naughty creatures have a very simple routine – Eat, Sleep and Play. And this cycle goes in loop throughout their life. The only changes that come in this cycle are the intervals between these three main activities increases and their duration decreases with their growing age. This was in short the entire life of dogs.Now a little homework you need to do before you start the training :-1.    Understand your pups entire routine. This will include all his day along activities along with time like when does he eat, when does he sleep, when does he go for a walk, how often does he eat and how much.2.    You need to understand when can you take him out and at what times and how far would be the places you can take him to pass off.3.    The words that you would use to prompt him to go out. These are very important as they are a lifelong learning for the pup and that’s how he can signal you that he wants to go out.That’s it. Just a little work. Pups generally want to pass after:-1.    Waking up in the morning(especially)2.    Sometime after having meals3.    Playing or rigorous activityThey don’t have much control over themselves so a good thing would be to take time out at least every hour or two. This absolutely does not mean that you wake him up from the sleep and take him out just because I said so. I am saying this because if your pup is very playful then it will need to pass after every hour or so. Morning schedule has to be followed strictly and not missed out at any cost else you’ll see wet patches on your favourite carpet. Eating meals stimulates their digestive system which is why when they are done, after 15-20mins take them out for a small walk. This will help them digest the food well as well as pass off.  You need to decide a place where you take him. In case you have a garden and want a specific spot to be introduced to him as his area to pass then take him there. This introduction has to be done in early years. Also always accompany him. Reasons – they feel secured and the bond between you and him enhances, to protect him from any unforeseen situation, to keep a check that it does not eat something outside(as this is the time when they are very exploring and when I say “EXPLORING” I mean every alphabet of it.), to keep him from scaring an older dog( which they love doing) and to watch his health as well. Initially, pat him whenever he understands your “secret” word and goes out to pass. You can also treat him for this. You can decide the time to take him out according to how far is the place from your house and fix the timings to take him out matching your and his schedule. As far as the words are concerned decide them carefully. Don’t mix them with any other command words. Some things to avoid disturbances in this routine: - 1. Don’t overfeed or frequently change their diet or the type of foods they generally have.2. Feeding at wrong times or not on fixed timings3. Excess of salt and spices(this makes them drink more water)4. Leaving the door open for the pup to come and go as it wants5. Restrict their access to carpets and rugs( just in case you want as they feel like grass).6. Don’t expect him to spend the entire night without going out especially when it’s so young.7. Punishing, scolding and shouting on him for any indoor accidents(this will make him scared of you and he might not pass in front of you)8. Leaving the pup alone for long hours. This will make him such an indoor person that it will not go out for long and will rush indoors quickly.Don’t be lazy. Laziness on your part would disrupt the habits of your pup. Some common problems faced by owners: --> Excited urination on greeting people or overdose of happiness – Sometimes pups get over excited when they greet people or get their favourite treat. To avoid this take him outside before anybody arrives at your house or before you are planning to give him his favourite treat.->Does not pass off when outside – Pups don’t relieve when out for  long walks and pass immediately getting indoors. You need to break this habit take him for a long walk so he is forced to go outside. Many a times things won’t go as planned. It’s okay. Understand you both are learning. He is learning something he doesn’t know and he can’t tell you what he feels. You need to give him time. And you are learning what he loves doing, eating and how much he loves you.Above all love him as much as you can. That’s the only emotion they have in abundance and they do it selflessly. Enjoy !! :D"

240,"Every dog is different, so anything anyone says is going to be a generalization, so just keep that in mind. They will be very smart, I've met German Shepherds and Huskies that were smarter than a lot of people I know (and I know a lot of smart people), so expect to be outwitted. I just texted a friend of mine who has a GSD-Husky mix and asked him what one thing he'd tell someone thinking about getting one, and he texted me back, saying, ""The dog will be smarter than you. Best to just accept that now."" Truer words...You must start training early. If you don't there's a tendency toward stubbornness, especially if you don't constantly reinforce training. They're very suited to a very active lifestyle, and would be best having a big yard.Also, expect fierce loyalty. That can be a problem, so make sure to socialize your pup early and often. You don't want your dog biting your date/spouse when you get frisky. It kinda dampens the mood. I'd also socialize with other pups and cats if possible at a very young age.Huskies and German Shepherds are consistently in the top 5 breeds that are likely to bite humans, so you must train, train, train and never allow them off leash when in public. If you let your dog off leash, the dog is going to pay the price if something goes wrong, so if you love them, leash them.Did I mention training?"

Then galaxies themselves will diffuse and spread apart, then solar systems (which will be long dead by then), followed by stellar remnant disintegration, planetary disintegration, molecular disintegration.What happens next is still open to conjecture, but we can do a thought experiment and come up with a pretty good answer.The accelerating expansion will then pull electrons from nuclei and pull protons and neutrons from the nucleus.Now things become interesting. All the neutrons will decay to protons, electrons, and anti-neutrino within a brief time, leaving protons as the next target.But what happens when the expansion rate becomes greater than the strong nuclear force? Well, we know that the proton is made up of three quarks (two up and one down). We also know that quarks cannot exist in isolation. So what happens? The increasing expansion of the universe becomes greater than the strong nuclear force and pulls the quarks apart. This takes a great deal of energy. Where does this energy come from?As the quarks are pulled apart, they combine with virtual quark particles from the vacuum energy and form mesons; quark and anti-quark pairs. Normally, the mesons would decay very quickly (10−8𝑡𝑜10−1610−8to10−1610^{-8}to 10^{-16}) seconds, but the rate of expansion pulls the quark anti-quark pair of the meson apart before it can decay. This produces two more mesons, which produce four mesons, which produce eight, and we have an exponentially increasing creation of matter.Where does the energy come from to create all this matter? One proposed form of dark energy is that it is equivalent to the vacuum energy of space, that is, virtual particles. And dark energy is proposed as the energy of acceleration.So now we see that dark energy is being converted to matter in the form of quark anti-quark mesons and thus the amount of dark energy is reduced. If dark energy is reduced, so then is the acceleration of the universe. Eventually, we have complete conversion of dark energy to meson matter. But the expansion continues and meson matter continues to form.We can think of the initial expansion rate of the universe as inertia. The continued formation of meson matter then begins to slow down the expansion rate. But since we have an exponential growth of meson matter, the expansion rate will slow down rapidly.When the expansion rate slows enough, the mesons will then have time to decay into photons (gamma), electrons, positrons, neutrinos, and anti-neutrinos. The electrons and positrons will combine and decay into two gamma photons. So the resulting universe will consist of photons, neutrinos, and anti-neutrinos.What happens next is completely unknown and would require some clever and difficult calculations to arrive at an answer. Will the resulting expansion rate become negative? Will the significantly increased mass-energy of the universe contribute to a negative expansion (shrinking)?Lots of good things to think about here.Cheers!"
245,"This is very old question. I am not sure, whether it’s a duplicate question. However, here goes my answer.Assumptions: You are trying to publish a novel. If you are trying to publish a text book the answer may vary.Following are various publishing processes.Self- publishingThese companies run with an assumptions that author will take entire burden while publishing a book.The model gets money from author.Edit/prints the book as per demand from authorTakes charges from author for marketing, cover page design, online posting.Royalty in this case varies between 10%-30%. However, the price of the book is normally high due to on demand print cost and higher margin.Most cases, very few self-published become successful best sellers unless author makes a gigantic effort.e.g. Companies includeNotion PressPatridge (They claim Penguine sister branch)Self Publishing and Print on Demand in Indiahttp://Leadstart.comWriter Place(Crossword backed)OnlineGatha: Self Publishing, Online Book Publishing, Print on Demand Indiahttp://becomesakespear.comMost cases the charges vary from Rs30K INR to Rs 300K INR. In US, the similar companies charge between $500- $15K.Advantage and Disadvantage of Using Self-publishingYou get your book in the print ASAP. Does not matter whether you have the skill or notRoyalty is bit higher compared to traditional publishing.Mark to market time is higher. I know many self-publishing houses who can get your book ready in 3–4 days.However, the higher price reduce the selling capability.Self-publishing companies focus only on selling the author package. They damn care about the book or the author.Traditional publishingCompanies like Penguine, Rupa, Random House, Westland etcThere is proper evaluation process, before book is selected for publishing.Royalty is very less(5–10%). Sometimes authors don’t get royalty if he is a new author.But if the book is a hit, he earns a lot due to distribution reach of these companies.Normally mark to market a book varies between 6 months to 1.5 year.There is absolutely no transparency to authors. Authors have no clue on how many number of copies sold etc.New Age publishingCompanies like Amazon, StoryMirror (My opinion might be biased).They do both physical and digital.Royalty is quite high(50% on profit) compared to both traditional and selfTransparency is there.Amazon does add based marketing. StoryMirror does not charge anything for marketing. Editing, Design, Marketing everything is free.It is upto you to choose, which one suits you.You can ignore following line if you want to not relevant to the question.P.S.About Me: I was an investment banker, working for a Swiss bank prior to starting StoryMirror. I was writing a book “Wheels Of Wish” - About a crime planned 800 years ago. I felt it was good book as later it turned out to be a national best seller. After I was done with the book, when I approached the publishers, I got resistance from traditional houses and self-publishing houses were asking exorbitant money close to Rs300K INR. I thought why not solve the publishing problem and a company was born. I along with Devendra built StoryMirror with an aim to give justice to creative community - Started with writing community - We have published 190 physical books so far, over 150K stories online, 3000 ebooks received and created 15 national best seller and reader base of 3M."
246,"Intrinio, where I am a writer, is working on this by building a financial data marketplace that addresses many of Bloomberg’s weaknesses.Bloomberg charges massive fees ($2,000 per person per month) for a terminal that includes just about everything any investor would want. This is great if you have $2,000/mo for each of your employees and need many types of data. Intrinio takes a different approach, allowing users to sign up for just the data feeds the need. This means that if you only need 1 or 2 feeds, your costs might be $40 or $140 per month, or even be free.Another problem with Bloomberg is that they restrict access to their data. This is changing somewhat, with online portals, but most Bloomberg users have to access the data they need through a specific “terminal.” Intrinio thinks this is ridiculous and so allows any number of users to access a single paid account via Excel, Google Sheets, or even API.This last access method, API, is probably the key difference. Fintech developers typically can’t build financial applications because company’s like Bloomberg have a monopoly on the data and charge outrageous prices if you want to redistribute their data via an app. Intrinio makes its data easy to access for developers and even has a program to give data away for free to startups.This article gives a good overview of Intrinio’s API.If you want to know who will disrupt Bloomberg, check out Intrinio. We are shaking up the status quo, making it affordable and easy to access financial data."
247,"The Flash (Barry Allen) originally wasn't very fast, actually.  He could run about the speed of sound, or Mach 1, in the comics and in the TV show.  This is because when he was struck by lightning and doused with chemicals, which sped up his metabolism to superhuman speeds, but not impossible speeds.  In the comics, Barry Allen then discovers a strange energy called the Speed Force.  This energy was found to actually exist outside the universe, surrounding it.  Barry Allen could then travel much faster, and, with practice, could travel up to light speed.  By siphoning kinetic energy from other objects in the universe, he could travel up to ""trans-time- speed,"" basically making him faster than any measure of time that exists.  The Speed Force allows him to do this because it supplies him with the energy needed to achieve these feats, and break the laws of physics."
248,"My suggestion would be the foreign exchange market (Forex). This is too little to invest in stocks (many brokers charge 10-15 bucks to make a trade whether in or out of a stock, this will eat profits. In Forex ( monetary trading, ie. the USD vs. Japanese dollar) the money is put in online and companies facilitating the trade make money off of the spread. This makes it much more possible to make money with frequent trades. First you will need to get aquainted with how these work (try out a forex simulator) however the possibilities are great, and I have seen people increase their investment by 12% in a week. You must be dedicated, however, this is no market to leave your money in and forget about it.If this is out of the question I would suggest loaning money to friends in need... ""Hey can you spot me $80 tonight?"" ""Sure, but you owe me $90 tomorrow""This works quite often, and can boost your return by a large amount over a few days if you get a bite.  The issue here is it works best among the young and their friends, and only in low quantities (if you tell somebody you'll lend them 4k today for 5k next week they are gonna tell you off)"
249,"The primary impacts will be in the form of:More employment[1]Better government services[2]Lower corruptionThis is why it attracts so much excitement. There are some side effects of lower prices over the long term, but compared to the benefits above, it is a relatively minor effect.The primary way to get India out of poverty is to have a manufacturing revolution. However, most entrepreneurs don’t want to setup factories in India. Part of the reason is due to extreme complexity in taxation. Clothing manufacturers would rather setup their factories in places like Bangladesh [already has GST and other reforms] rather than the traditional textile power of India.What the GST seeks to do is to remove one of the primary hurdles in setting up business in India. When factories can move things efficiently and effectively comply with laws, more factories will be created. When more factories are created, there will be more jobs, lower prices [more competition] and more tax collection for the government.The GST is expected to bring government more revenues and this has been the case in many other countries that have implemented: Goods and services tax (Australia).When governments make more money through GST either they can reduce other taxes or increase services. Either of these will be benefit for the common man.Finally, the GST will enable much more transparency and lower corruption as there is a single window of tax collection than an opaque system with babus inserting hands in every window.Biggest concerns:The tax rate is very high[3]especially for services. Even at the proposed 18% it is higher than most of Indian competitors such as Thailand, Malaysia, Singapore, China etc. The government doesn’t want to cap even this.There is no clarity on how the city municipalities will get their share as they are no longer allowed to tax octroi and other taxes.Hoping that these kinks are rolled out. Ultimately it is the big picture that excites.Almost every country in the world have moved to GST in the past 25 years[4] and the experience has been mostly positive. Hardly 20 countries are holding out, India one among them.Footnotes[1] India's reverse Brexit: GST will create million of formal jobs - The Economic Times[2] Here's Why the Landmark GST Bill has the Potential to be a Gamechanger for India[3] Worldwide VAT, GST and Sales Tax Guide - Rates[4] Countries Implementing GST or VAT"

251,"Contrary to popular belief in this thread, it is entirely possible to accurately self-diagnose a “mental illness”. The fact that it is risky, potentially unnecessary, and professionally unverified is where the ethical conundrum comes in. It may not be in your best interest, and you may not have the information that would lead you to a proper understanding of whether it is in your best interest.Secondly, it is also possible to figure out an appropriate medication regimen on your own, in the rarer cases that a medication regimen is the most useful strategy. But, once again, that is highly risky, potentially unnecessary, and lacking the professional oversight and resources that are ideal towards keeping drugging more productive and less dangerous.The first is not the worst idea, if it is a constructive step for you and you do not rely on that diagnosis to determine your life path or risk-taking therapeutic goals. The second is not a good idea at all. Even if you are one of the minority that could benefit significantly from drugging, the trickiness and substantial risks involved with psychiatric psychotropics means one could not conscionably suggest that you would be better off taking that sort of risk as compounded by a lack of professional input and oversight.Ultimately, the DSM and prescribing information packets are not the governing forces behind psychiatric decisions. They are guidelines and fuzzy boundaries and they neither guarantee accurate and helpful outcomes nor safety and appropriateness. The level of additional understanding and experience-driven expertise involved in tactical and risk-reducing prescribing of psychotropic drugs in the mental health setting is not reducible to a few chapters of a book, though handling the needs of a single patient is at least less of a potential shitfest than fancying yourself a doctor and taking on clients.Basically, can this turn out well? Sure. That does not mean it is more likely to, and it has not even been established on authority that medication is a good idea in the first place.Do understand that ‘finding the right dose’ is not the most difficult part of prescribing psychiatric drugs. Finding the drugs that cause the least amount of trouble for someone while still being meaningfully useful, and dealing with emergent side effects (which can be life-threatening, long term, or disabling)—including withdrawal syndromes—is a more pressing matter. So, it is not just about “right drug, right dose”, but how to taper up and down, what drug combinations to avoid, how to notice negative side effects and what aspects of the drugging to ascribe them to, etc.A professional will not necessarily do a great job at all, and thousands upon thousands of patients experience preventable harms and death because of how the mental healthcare system is run at the moment. However, this is not something you want to do without professional consultation—especially good professional consultation. If you are desperate and determine to do something about your experiences, focusing on the non-pharmaceutical methods until you can access a psychiatrist or other kind of competently prescribing doctor is probably the best idea.Some psychiatrists, to note, are available by telephone or videoconference. It is not the most reliable or responsible way to evaluate patients or prescribe drugs, but even that would be better than ‘flying blind’ in the professional sense. There are also free, low-cost, or sliding-scale psychiatric practices in many areas, though this may not be an option for you still.And, to be clear, I am not a healthcare professional, either. This is just lay commentary from someone who has dealt with many providers, facilities, conditions, drugs, and patients."
252,"There are several possibilities. One common issue with air travel is DVT - Deep Vein Thrombosis, commonly called blood clots. A blood clot may interfere with circulation and result in pain. Another possible issue is a bone spur or arthritis. It is commonly assumed that you can't have arthritis because of your age. I was diagnosed with arthritis at a younger age than you currently are and had symptoms that were ignored for many years at that time. There are many kinds of arthritis and many of them are not restricted to older people.There are other possibilities, but those are two that I am familiar with because I have both. I am not a doctor and I am not qualified to express an opinion on other possibilities. Whatever is causing your pain needs to have a doctor’s examination to evaluate. Don't ignore pain. Pain is one of your body's only methods of warning you that a problem exists. The problem may be easily remedied or it may be a warning of something much more serious. Early identification of a problem can save your life or prevent the problem from getting worse. So see a doctor as soon as possible."
253,"I firstly would like to mention: Perception. If you have a workaround how to think things from different perspectives, you can be an effective leader.I will list down the absolute qualities I can, and then state relevant examples of people who have been a good leader with respect to the qualities that I apprehend.The first quality I think a good leader must have, on the contrary, is being a good team member. No one respects a leader who is not himself a good team member but forces or implicates things on the followers. MS DHONI focuses his mindset mostly around starting with fitness. He calls on every member of the team to stay at the fittest level they can, and no one can even think of denying the fact, that he indeed is one of the fittest players Indian team has ever had.2. The second quality I would suggest is VISION. If every member becomes someone who has a vision, then it will be a problem. You need the thinkers and the doer’s, and leaders presumably fall in the first category. I must make it clear that I here don’t mean the reverse can’t be true: Every good leader must have VISION doesn’t mean, team members don’t need vision.The true power of VISION can be effective in settling down the scope of leadership, and how overall leader-follower working is gonna follow.I have dozens of leaders with good examples of VISION: Steve Jobs, Bill Gates(Arguably), Sundar Pichai, Larry Page and so on….3. The third quality every leader must have is a fighting spirit, which must mathematically be more than or equal to the unnerving spirit of each member of the team. I know its difficult to comprehend this directly but think about it. The followers will never retreat a leader who has such a fighting spirit, who can go to any extremes for the right principles, and the best example of such leader can be Nelson Mandela or maybe Sir Alex Ferguson, people who had literally remained calm in the worst of their times, possessed the fighting spirit that was needed for stability of their factions, and later on revolutionized their respective fields.4. The fourth quality a leader must definitely possess is incredible passion, you don’t follow someone who can’t follow their own passion. I think the example of Elon Musk is more than enough for this point. Probably, a million haters were invisible to him because of his passion to do what he wants to do.5. The fifth quality a leader must possess according to me is knowing the potential of their followers. I will quote this: “ A good leader doesn’t need to be the smartest person of the faction, but someone who knows who is the smartest”. A leader is not only someone who realizes the potential his team carries but someone who drives to push these limits either, by inspiration or direct influence. If a leader master’s this art, he can further achieve to more attributes very easily: a. Delegation of tasks and b. Network establishment.A leader must also have other typical qualities like perseverance, knowing when to be patient and when to be aggressive, strategizing ability and also ability to formulate rules that sound fair to everyone.“Remember, great leaders aren’t born natural, they become great in their journey”."

Trio of Congress, S.P., Mayawati. BJP Strategy is to divide Dalit & Muslim vote bank. Now, It will hard for Amit shah to divide vote & win seats.Now, Bihar has 40 seats. Here duo of Congress & Lalu Prasad Yadav will work. Dalit have 16 % vote bank & Muslim has 17% of vote bank & Yadav’s. Lalu have hold over these Vote. Muslim vote always divide between Congress & RJD. As they will come together they will have majority of seats.Now State like West Bengal, Kerala, Tamil Nadu where BJP has bare minimum presence. Consist of 42,20,39 Seats respectively.Now BJP has to work over 366 seats to get into power. Now, Andhra pradesh , Telangana, Odhisa have strong presence of local party.It will be very hard for BJP to manage & win over 366 seats. It will be hard to Win.Now, After 2019 election , Prime minister equation will come in politics. Party which won highest no. of seats will be Prime minister. Mulayam , Mamta, Tejaswani yadav, Rahul Gandhi will front end contender. If our Luck favour us Politician like Chandrababu Naidu may get top post. Modi or Amit shah will be opposition leader they will not move to Gujarat because they know it is “Chand dino ki sarkar” ( Few days Government”).History will repeat itself.As in 1996 HD Devegowda rule’s 324 days government. Mulayam will rule 324 days government.As in 1997 Indra kumar gujral has rule 332 days government Mamta will rule 332 days government.Now, Congress will go to president to resign from government.

But we will be building foreign Military base in Assumption Island, Sabang Island. We might see some of worst decision but some of the best decision but it will be much better than Inaction.In 2026, general election Modi will again loose election. Modi will retire from Politics as Vajpayee did. UPA will form government, Rahul Gandhi will be Prime minister. UPA I will be benefited with work done by Modi. Then, UPA II will come one of the worst ruling government.We will say we should have voted for Modi 2026 as well. As we say for P.v. Narshima rao, Vajpayee.

258,"As you know Swami Vivekananda was a Bengali so he must be eating fish, eggs and other non-vegetarian diets . His guru Ramakrishna Paramhans was known to eat fish. If you don't have any idea about Ramakrishna Mission then I would like to share my experience.When I was student aged 18-19 I used to visit Ramakrishna Mission Ashram almost every week and met many sanyasis there. Moreover I visited some section of Ashram which was not meant to be visited by common public.Now I am sharing what I came to know and how Ramakrishna mission is different from other religious organizations and still without any controversy since 1896.There was a fish pond in Ashram and all sanyasis were eating fish. My brother once went there to arrange books in book store and had lunch there. He was served fried fish.Moreover I can found book in Ashram like:""Gay palan kaise kare"" (How to run an animal farm)""Murgi palan kaise kare"" (How to run a poultry farm)""Madumakkhi plan kaise kare"" (How to run a bee farm)So it is obvious that they don't oppose eating non-vegetarian.Unlike other Babas who keep on forcing people to get Diksha from them, I had completely different experience.When I told one swami ji that I want to take ""Diksha"" he asked me ""Diksha lekar kya karoge. Manavta ki sewa sabse badi sewa hai."" (No need to take Diksha, serving mankind is the biggest service)Moreover Once I entered the Ashram there was a board on which it was written that ""Sabhi sampraday ke logo ka swagat hai"" (People of all community irrespective of their religion are welcomed)I had seen muslim & christian to come there for treatment in their charitable dispensaries or to study at library.They never organize any satsang program outside their premises. They never promote people to connect to Ramakrishna Mission or Math.Now Criteria for being a Sanyasi:1. You should not be married/separate/divorcee. 2. You should not be fade up of life and come to Ashram to become a sanyasi.3. You would not keep any relation to your parents/relatives/friends.4. You would never discuss about your previous home once you become a sanyasi.5. You will never join politics.Now see examples of other Babas1. Asaram is married, having kids and running his baba business2. Many babas have families which they left.3. They keep relation to their old home4. They never hide their old home5. They join politics. Example: Satpal Maharaj, Yogi Adityanath, Uma Bharti etc.Moreover Swami Vivekananda never objected any of Hindu rituals. Even he alwasy supported idolatry. No where in Hindu religion books it is mentioned that Hindus were vegetarians. Concept of vegetarianism came as an effect of Jainism.On every demise of President of Ramakrishna Mission and Math I see news that PM and President of India pay his condolences.Mahasamadhi of Srimat Swami Ranganathanandaji Maharaj""On his demise, condolence messages were received from Dr A P J Abdul Kalam, President of India, Dr Manmohan Singh, Prime Minister of India, Smt Sonia Gandhi, President, All-India Congress Committee, Sri S M Krishna, Governor of Maharashtra, and Sri T N Chaturvedi, Governor of Karnataka. Sri Gopalkrishna Gandhi and Sri Buddhadev Bhattacharya, Governor and Chief Minister of West Bengal, also paid their homage. Messages also poured in from many other Indian and foreign dignitaries, officials, organizations and individuals from different walks of life. Sri I K Gujral, former Prime Minister of India, and Sri L K Advani, former Deputy Prime Minister of India, wrote articles in eminent dailies about their association with Revered Maharaj and his great contribution to the social and spiritual welfare of humanity. On the 26th, the Rajya Sabha and Lok Sabha (the upper and lower houses of the Indian Parliament) paid homage to Revered Maharaj by standing in silence for a short while as a mark of respect to his memory. The press, All-India Radio and Doordarshan gave extensive coverage. Newspapers in Bangladesh also published the news of his demise prominently."""

260,"Good question, because people are often confused by this.Properly speaking, the CCS are a set of specific guidelines about what students should know at each grade level in Math and English Language Arts/Literacy. You can find the complete list of Standards at Common Core State Standards Initiative. You can read how these Standards were developed at About the Standards.It is important to note that these Standards were developed by a consortium of state and private-sector interests. The federal government was not involved in the development process, but strongly endorsed them after publication.The most common sources of confusion about the CCS is what they are not.They are not a set of classroom practices, teaching methods, or curricula. There are no official CCS curricula. Various publishers claim that their products are ""CCS-aligned"", but it is difficult to evaluate these claims independently. Likewise, you might see rants about ""crazy Common-Core questions"" (especially math problems), but such claims are nonsense--again, CCS is not a list of problems, it is a set of outcomes that you can read as linked above.They are not a standardized testing regime. There are actually two major standardized tests supposedly based on CCS (SBAC and PARCC), and numerous smaller ones (especially state-level tests). Again, these are neither a part of CCS nor necessarily endorsed by them.Bottom line: As both a parent and as a mathematics educator, I think that CCS represent a good, if incremental, improvement over earlier (NCTM) Standards, and have been much more effective at generating visibility (though sometimes more negative than positive, unfortunately). I am not sure that we are anywhere near ready for standardized testing based on CCS, since implementation is new and inconsistently supported. Professional development for teachers lags significantly, as it usually does. It would probably take a full generation of students passing through CCS--i.e, a K-12 experience--before it is fair to begin assessment of implementation. Unfortunately, I doubt that we have the patience for that."
261,"How do you go from nothing to a published research paper? The first and most important step is the least glamorous: Read, Read, and Read. You cannot go anywhere without first doing a thorough review of the literature. You picked a topic: now go to the library or to Google Scholar or something and read everything you can about that topic. Everything. This serves two purposes: you learn what research has already been done, and you get a foundation in your topic that will help you come up with a question and design your project. In the course of your readings you may come up with a question. Search for articles that may answer that question and, if you don't find any, keep searching a few more times just to be sure and, if you still don't find any, congratulations! You have a topic. Now do some research on methods that could be used to answer your question, and you're ready to start your experiments.Experiments done? Good. See which papers you read are close to the one you want to write, find the journal they were published in, see their submissiob guidelines, and write accordingly.Don't ever expect to be done with the reading, by the way: new research is always coming out, so reading literature is something you will be doing forever. If it's a topic you enjoy, however, you won't mind.While you're doing this, be sure to take notes! You will be citing all of these sources when you write your research paper, so be sure to record the citation information and the findings and useful information from each paper you read. I use Endnote, but there is other citation software out there.To give you an idea, in the past four years I have read (or at least skimmed or saw the abstract of) nearly 1000 papers related in some way to my research topic or methods, and another 150 on a side topic, and 75 on another side project. For a large review paper I wrote on yet another side topic, I read nearly 400 papers. I didn't / won't cite all of these in the papers I write (most papers have 30-40 citations or so), but to get enough information to know what has been done, what needs to be done, and how to do it all I have had to read a lot, and continue to do so.~~~Besides the literature review, running your experiment, writing and submitting of the paper, and the waiting while it gets reviewed and hopefully accepted for publication will take a long time. Your 4-6 month timeline is quite unrealistic unless you are doing something in the humanities or writing a review or commentary where lab work isn't needed."

263,"If you aren't having bad dreams a lot (in which case, talk to a therapist), there are several things that can help afterward:...write out or draw (simple stick figures/etc totally fine) an alternative for the bad part of the dream, or add something to happen just after that part that would change the ending; you can use something that could have been a different way of reacting/etc in the dream, or just totally make up something ...you can also tell that alternative to someone, but writing or drawing may work even better for your brain...tell someone you trust about the bad dream; then hopefully talk about little bits of the dream as well as the big parts...doing that can just make the feelings less horrible, but if you discuss/analyze the bits your brain may float up things that ""remind you of"" which could be situations that actually caused the dream and its feelings in the first place so you can understand where the general feelings might have come from (knowledge is comforting and power)...just draw little bits of the dream (any images at all, small or large, and from the bad parts of the dream or other parts)...there's something about doing that that can help; perhaps doing that (like some of the other strategies above) has put you in control of them even if just drawing or speaking them, and also anything you ""concretize"" by putting out in the world from your brain helps keep it from going round-and-round in your head and also does other good thingsBefore you go to bed, you can also try to avoid having the last thing on your mind be something unpleasant and/or where you don't have reasonable control. If that's a problem, try proactively to think of opposite things (or better, jot them down on a pad beside your bed or even earlier in the day) at that time. You can think of situations that would make you happy or ones where you were happy or things you'd like to explore, for example, etc. Doing that kind of thing right before bed kind of sets your brain in that mode, and some people feel you can even ""ask"" your brain to dream about certain things by doing it.Of course, also don't do things right before bed like eating a large meal; exercising; watching screens and/or especially violent, active or conflict-laden things; etc."
264,"I'll try to be serious and answer this question the best way I can. I have never heard of this internet phenomenon of ""Slav squatting"" until now, and I find it absolutely hilarious. I thought the whole world was squatting just like we are. You may laugh, but I am actually squatting on my chair while writing this. Now to the point. I will write from my point of view, and I don't know if it applies to the other people (Slavic people).First thing first: squatting simply feels comfortable for me. I lay my feet flat on the ground, my knees bent, and I rest my whole upper body on my knees and hamstrings. Sometimes I also squat on balls of my feet, putting few of my fingers on the ground for aditional stability.Sadly, most present day teenage and adult Slavs grew up in impoverished post-socialist countries. There were no videogames, and we didn't spent much time watching TV (There were only 3 channels in my country, none of them for the kids). We spent our time in parks and outdoors running, playing soccer, immitating cowboys and Indians, playing war games, and doing other silly things that (Slavic) kids do. When you get tired, you could either sit on the ground, as most parks and playgrounds didn't have benches, and get dirty, or squat. So squatting came naturally and became a habit for most kids.Also, most toilets in schools were squatting toilets, so that had some influence too. Even today I squat on my modern flush toilet. It simply feels better.Now for the photo thing. That comes from the pure utility: class photos were taken every year, and to make whole class of 30 student fit in one photo, boys were usually squatting in the first row, and girls were standing behind them in the second row. So the boys gained habit of taking photos in squatting position. Eventually, it became cool to take photos while squatting.I am sorry for my bad english, and I hope I gave you some insight on this squatting habit of ours."

266,"In thirty years I have never experienced the scenario you purpose. There is always a “lead” surgeon on a case who may not be the most experienced but there is always an implied “captain of the ship.” My first real “captain…” experience was when I was on faculty where I trained in general surgery. The Chief of Surgery was a man named John Kirklin who I respected greatly and was the world’s leading pediatric cardiovascular surgeon of his day. He referred a baby to me whose sternum opened exposing his little heart for me to repair. He asked if I would consent to using his OR and operative team for the procedure; which I did. We scrubbed together and talked bout my plan. As we both entered the OR, as I had done hundreds of times as a resident, his team insisted of gowning and gloving me first and directed me to the patient’s right side; the side where the operating surgeon stands. He was the perfect first assistant as we used the babies’ pectoralis muscles to cover his exposed heart. At the end of the case he was effusive with his praise and I realized I had passed the ultimate test for a trainee. Dr. Kirklin realized that there could only be one captain, and for this baby it was me."

269,"I am an expert on religious rights in prison.  They are extensive, but still have limitations.  Native Americans can't have peyote.  Rastafarian inmates can't have weed.  Muslims can't have congregational prayer five times a day (they may get together in the Chapel once or twice).  Custody levels normally kept separate cannot combine for Jumah prayer.  Asatru cannot use swords and war hammers, and Nazi symbolism is out.  Wiccans can't have an ritual dagger; neither can the Sikhs(tiny, 1"", daggers attached to a block of wood are sometimes allowed).  Religious head wear that does not obscure the face is usually allowed (a Rasta crown, a Jewish kippa, a Muslim kufi).  Jumah prayer will occur every Friday at mid day except during lock downs, even if hundreds are involved.  Ramadan will be observed, and the prison will go to great pains to make it happen.  Native American sweat lodge ceremonies will take place with regularity, with all expense paid by the government.  The complex I supervised, four prisons, used a cord of wood each week (mixed hardwood, about $300 here in the desert).  Oh, and we dispensed tobacco for the ceremonies, in a tobacco free institution, because the right to use it is part of the rights retained by Native Americans."
270,"Clash of Clans is a popular mobile game where you build your village and attack other players. One of the primary currencies in Clash of Clans is Gems, which are essential for building some of the most important buildings in the game. You can also use Gems to speed up production, but this should be avoided if you're trying to save them for important buildings. Gems can be difficult to come by, as the developers want you to buy them from the cash store, but with a little planning you'll never need to spend it.Part 1. Removing ObstaclesFind plants and rocks in your village. These are obstacles that need to be removed in order to build something at that spot. There will be about 40 objects around your village when you first start.Removing rocks costs Gold, and removing plants costs Elixir.2. Start removing obstacles. When you remove an obstacle, you are awarded anywhere from 0-6 Gems. The amount you receive is predetermined, and follows the pattern below, which repeats after reaching the end. This pattern cannot be changed, and will always repeat in the same order:6, 0, 4, 5, 1, 3, 2, 0, 0, 5, 1, 0, 3, 4, 0, 0, 5, 0, 1, 03. Leave space for plants to regrow. Plants will reappear once every eight hours, allowing you to keep removing them for more Gems. They will not appear, however, if all of the space in your village is taken. The plant must also have an extra tile of space between it and any other object, meaning the surrounding 8 tiles will need to be empty as well.Rocks do not come back, but plants do.4. Earn the achievement. You will earn an achievement for clearing obstacles from your village. After clearing five obstacles, you will earn five Gems. When you remove 50 obstacles, you will earn ten Gems. When you remove 500 obstacles, you will earn 20 Gems.Part 2. Completing AchievementsCheck out the list of available achievements. Clash of Clans awards you achievements when you accomplish certain goals in the game, such as upgrading buildings, winning battles, and collecting gold. Completing these achievements earns you rewards, including gems. The more difficult achievements will earn you more gems.When you open the Achievements screen, you will see your current progress towards available achievements. Prioritize your playtime to try to earn these achievements as quickly as possible.Each achievement has three levels, with increased rewards for each level.By completing all of the available achievements, you can earn up to 8,637 Gems.2. Fight other players. The most valuable achievements are earned through battle with other players. You can earn thousands of Gems by completing these achievements. Some of the more high-value achievements include:Sweet Victory! - This achievement is earned by winning trophies in multiplayer battles. Winning 1,250 trophies will earn you 450 Gems.Unbreakable - This achievement is earned by successfully defending against attackers. Defending against 1,000 attacks will earn you 100 Gems.Friend in Need - This achievement is earned by providing reinforcements to your allies. Donating 25,000 reinforcements will earn you 250 Gems.League All-Star - This achievement is earned by advancing through the Clash of Clans league. Joining the Crystal League earns you 250 Gems, reaching the Master League earns you 1,000 Gems, and becoming the Champion earns you 2,000 Gems.Firefighter - This achievement is earned by destroying your opponent's Inferno Towers. Destroying 5,000 towers earns you 1,000 Gems.War Hero - This achievement is earned by winning stars for your clan in War Battles. Scoring 1,000 stars will earn you 1,000 Gems.Spoils of War - This achievement is earned by collecting gold from Clan War bonuses. Earning 100,000,000 gold will earn you 1,000 Gems.3. Complete lesser achievements. There are a variety of achievements that aren't related to combat that can earn you some Gems as well. These don't pay out ..."
271,"The developers are debating that big time right now and I've been interviewing dozens of mobile developers lately. There isn't a clear ""one winner."" Most developers are developing for both (although I'm noticing more bleeding edge apps, like Word Lens, pictured above, are only available on iOS), but if you have to pick one, here's some of the things that will affect your choices.1. iOS has a more monetizeable audience  (IE it is more likely to buy apps for a variety of reasons). Notice that Angry Birds shipped first on iOS, where they charged for that, but when they came out on Android they made it free and put advertising in it. This is why Otavio Good, the developer of Word Lens, pictured here, went with iOS for the time being. He charges $10 for the full app. He built his app so the technology can be easily ported to a number of different platforms, but went with iOS first because he'll get paid. Listen to him at http://scobleizer.com/2011/01/13...2. iOS is somewhat more fun to develop for because the tools are stronger. Yeah, that question alone can get some good flamewars going, but I hear this often enough that I'll take a stand on it on the Apple side.3. There are more Android devices out there, and will probably be many more in the future, so it makes sense to ship on Android first. But, on the iPhone side, Apple users are heavier app and web users than Android users. Sephora, eBay, Starbucks, OpenTable, and other developers tell me that they see more users of their services on iOS, even though the total number of Android devices is higher. This is why VC Fred Wilson says to develop for Android: http://www.avc.com/a_vc/2010/10/... but why developers like Flipboard go iOS first.4. Iteration time is lower on Android. A developer this morning told me he develops on Android, because he can ship it nearly instantly and get feedback, then he ports it to iOS from there.5. Android is more open. Swype, for instance, showed me their very cool keyboard, which they were able to ship on Android due to its openness. They showed me it working on iPad/iPhone, but Apple wouldn't approve their app. So, if you are looking to do something that breaks Apple's rules, I wouldn't do it on iOS. (You can listen to Swype's founders, here: http://scobleizer.com/2010/09/14... ).6. Less fragmentation on iOS. On Android, developers tell me they need to test their app on dozens of phones to make sure that it works (it doesn't, they tell me, so you gotta debug on different devices). On iOS, debugging is a much easier prospect.7. In app sales easier on iOS. Because Apple forces every user to put in a credit card (and has taught them the value of doing that) app developers who are trying in-app purchases are seeing much higher adoption than on Android platform, where users aren't as used to turning over a credit card."

275,"Reading the answers already provided, I find myself a little bit frustrated. Many of the female characters chosen are women filling roles typically associated with masculine characters (no nonsense, aggressive, gun-toting bad-asses). These characters are strong, to be sure, but many of them seem to be strong only because they are doing things that male characters typically do. I'd just like to nominate the following women from my favorite American TV drama of all time, The West Wing. Since it was an ensemble cast, none of these characters were technically the protagonist of the stories told on that show, but each displays a strength that is both genuine and rooted in femininity.C.J. Cregg (Allison Janney) for routinely going toe-to-toe with the entire White House press corps.Donna Moss (Janel Maloney) for routinely going toe-to-toe with her boss, the ever-arrogant, ever-brilliant Josh Lyman.Abbey Bartlet (Stockard Channing) for routinely going toe-to-toe with her husband, the President of the United States, Josiah Bartlet.Delores Landingham (Kathryn Joosten) for routinely going toe-to-toe with everyone who walked into the West Wing, not the least of which was her former boss' son, and current boss, President Bartlet. **Sorry.

I tried to stay away from him, I tried to not contact him, but he always considered me a good friend and I did not want to end that. Also, I never ever wanted to create a problem in his life!Now I say, Love does not only make you blind in your eyes but also in your brains :D"

It's Bull Harbison."" *[* If Mr. Harbison owned a slave named Bull, Tom would have spoken of him as ""Harbison's Bull,"" but a son or a dog of that name was ""Bull Harbison.""] The dog, in other words, actually gets the dignity of the last name.  The slave does not. After Emancipation, as a previous answer points out, many former slaves took their former owners' surnames.  Since there were Irish immigrants in the American South, and some of them were slaveowners, it's entirely possible that there were and are African-American families named ""Dolan"" as a result of their history as slaves of Irish owners. This answer is not intended to speak to the conditions of slavery in countries other than the United States."
281,"The length of time that elapses before the body rises depends not only upon the amount of fat contained in the tissues but on the temperature of the water. If the water is warm, the formation of gas within the body occurs rapidly and the body may rise to the surface in a day or two. However, if the water is cold, bacterial action takes place very slowly and it may take several weeks before the body appears on the surface. When a body is fully distended it is almost impossible to sink even with counter weights."
282,"3 years.. a friend and you miss him.Are you alone? Do you not have something else to do with your life that can keep you occupied so that you won't worry about missing someone from 3 yrs or 4yrs ago?You can miss a person. Be it as a friend..be it a lover.. but we should not 'worry' about missing them too much. Either you are very lonely and you keep thinking about the past or there is something beyond friendship you feel for the person.(i am guessing)Hence a simple friend is now keeping you worried. Why can't you contact them?What you do when life moves on...people who you care become a part of past? YOU MOVE ON TOO. Because we have a life to live too. Because whoever it is that is haunting you in thoughts, that is hurting you somewhere in the heart with his/her absence is no longer there beside you. I don't want to know why, but they are not really there and not a part of your life. So move on. Say 'It's ok to miss but i have a life to live. They are not here anymore.' to yourself whenever you miss them too much. Take up productive work..or hobbies you love..spend time with people who are willing to be there for you.. This will reduce the missing feeling eventually."

When you take your time, you really get to experience the city like the French do- and you will meet and talk to locals, too. I’ve been to Paris 3 times, and I still haven’t seen all the sights.Wouldn’t it be nice to just go for a stroll in the Latin Quarter, and have no agenda, but just explore?Wouldn’t it be nice to take two mornings to see the Louvre- and enjoy a beautiful picnic in the park afterwards?Don’t forget Versailles takes a whole day to visit. Get there before 9 am and you’ll beat the crowds and be the only ones in the room. You can pretend you are royalty until about 11am- then it’s too crowded and time to go explore the gardens.The smaller museums are less crowded and you have more time to enjoy the exhibits. La Maison Victor Hugo and other period homes are so interesting and full of history.Enjoy Le Musee D’Orsay and have lunch there too! Don’t rush it.Montmartre is so pretty, you’ll want to spend a whole day there.Explore the parks and bridges (each one has an amazing history)- walk along the Seine, take a Bateau-Mouche at night for a romantic trip.Explore Le Marais and do as many walking tours (with your own map) as possible.I find that when you try to cram too much in, you don’t really have time to enjoy it, learn about a new culture and make memories. Take the time to get to know the people at the hotel, the conscierge, the waiters. Those will be the highlights of your trip.When you rush through a trip, you come back with photos, but few memories."

Delhi’s people, in particular, made it happen and deserve recognition. The policy shows that it is possible for Delhi to take bold policy choices and achieve remarkable results in a short time. ""Although there were several naysayers, including the Delhi Police (Understaffed Delhi Police says enforcing odd-even scheme will be tough ), BJP leaders (Odd-even scheme will fail, AAP looking for escape route: BJP , Odd-Even scheme has practical problems: Satish Upadhyay ), even Bangalore Police Commissioner who said that it was impossible to put a traffic constable in every hook and corner, the Delhi people surprised them by 99% adherence to it.Although BJP leaders still tried to create drama (BJP MP Satyapal Singh caught breaking ‘Odd-Even’ rule in Delhi; ex-Mumbai Police Commissioner forced to pay fine ), and at the 11th hour, LG passively ordered a government officers' strike (Delhi, Centre sparring threatens odd-even scheme (Evening Lead)) the people kept their faith.Following were the success stories:Good adherence: In 14 days (Sunday excluded), only 9,144 fines were collected.

India only has 250 Su 30 which are able to fight in the field.while Pakistan has 250 self made jf-17 4th gen fighters and 70–80 F-16s all of which are enough to comeback india. Furthermore, Pakistan is highly advanced in case of nuclear warheads so pakistan yield much more damage to India in case of a nuclear war. Also if you take a look at history despite of less military Pakistan was successful in obtaining half of Kashmir in 1947, was successful in defence against india in 1965, killed 4000 men destroyed 114 jets and 600 tanks , In kargil Pakistan killed 7500 soldiers with loss of 105. If we consider Russia as an allie of India we should keep in mind that China, Pakistan and Russia have developed strong bonds in the past 3–4 years. Pakistan also does joint military exercises with Russia.Another thing is the military inteligence which is ISI in Pak which stands the best in the world and the special services group which is SSG in pak standing 5th in the world and Indian MARCOS standing 8th in the world.Lastly, Pakistan has one thing which india lacks and will always lack.

288,"My grandfather died around two years ago at the age of 92.He was the oldest person in my village when he died.However, after looking at his pathetic state, I never wish to have such a long life.He lost his hearing ability around 4 years before his death.He lost his vision around 3 years before his death.He lost his memory couple of years before he died.He was bed ridden for last two years and unable to go to toilet also.He would forget after taking his food that he has eaten and then keep shouting for food.He would sleep in the day and remain awake in the night when he would shout loudly and disturb all family members.We have to accept that we all have to die one day.Death is also not the end as death is an opportunity to begin a new life and start afresh as a child because our soul is immortal.Bhagawat Gita says, “Just as an individual will discard old clothes and wears new one, so does the body-dweller discard old bodies and obtain other new bodies.”Why to stay in the old and stinking body and not accept a new body to start a new life.Even if you don’t believe in the immortality of soul, still death is not to be feared.The famous Roman philosopher Epicurus famously said, ""Death is nothing to us…. When we exist, death is not; and when death exists, we are not. All sensation and consciousness ends with death and therefore in death there is neither pleasure nor pain.”When you are conscious of death, which may come to us any moment, you appreciate every moment of your life and live your life to the fullest.Subscribe to my YouTube Channel Awdhesh Singh to watch my latest videos in Hindi and English updated daily."

293,"I think it's interesting that only VCs and entrepreneurs jumped into this conversation. As a professional who has worked at several startups, I have a slightly different perspective.The good professionals who work at startups - the people you want to be at your startup - have goals that don't line up exactly with the founders' or investors' goals. Like the investors but perhaps unlike the founders, they need a huge exit (or a good salary), because their small ownership stakes (<0.1% for middle management, 1% for a vp) aren't going to be life-changing otherwise. Like the founders, but perhaps not like the investors, they need the intrinsic feeling of doing something good for the world (not just making other people comfortably well off). Unlike either founders or investors, they need professional growth, and this is perhaps the most important thing for a startup employee - and the main reason why you need to raise more money than you think. A resource starved environment that's just scraping by can't provide any of that, least of all professional growth.So, before you've proved the model, sure, bootstrap like mad, raise as little as possible, run on fumes, overwork everyone, etc. This is especially true for software startups where salaries are the primary expense, and not equipment, and where a couple of co-founders salaries represent a large portion of total expenses. But as soon as you find the market, if you want to attract and retain the best team, don't starve the business. Raise at least what you need to ensure you can attract and retain the best people.PS - Some examples: Twitter, Groupon, Evernote, EventBrite, Zynga, and FourSquare recently raised money have followed this path of finding the model, raising money, and stepping on the gas. And you can see it by looking at their jobs postings and hiring. And I've witnessed firsthand companies lose top talent from being resource starved, but I'll refrain from making examples of them here."

Sensex halted down by a great extent.Sensex was closed at 27,591 and touched the low of 25,902 which is 1689 point down from previous closed indicating a drop of 6.12%.Apart from this, US election is also over the head pressurising the Indian economy if Trump wins the game.IT stocks are suffering due to US election. However, black money curbing event might not affect these stock much as most of the transaction are from overseas in digital modes. No interaction of notes.Real estate stock was suffering from this 500 & 1000 black money curbing. And real estate also need a good amount of operational ready cash to operate the daily operational expense limit.Banking stock was also suffered a lot. Bank Nifty faced a severe fall but that doesn't justify the case. The banks are the one which are benefited the most from this event.Yes! thsi step doesn’t have any negative impact on Indian economy. Right now, panic is driving the dalal street. Everything will get settle in a while.But one should stay prepared for this kind of events. It creates a mass destruction. Explodes a large amount of value.Side note: We are also working on a Fintech product which will work as a alerting service for such types of specific events.This year, there are many events like:Sensex was down by more than 1000 points on Brexit announcement.Surgical Strike against Pakistan - Sensex drove by 500 points.Now this 500 & 1000 note issue - Sensex touched the down face of 1600 points.US election is also creating a major fear as Trump wins the election.Look. How market gone crazy over these horrible events. Exploded crores of market cap in just one shot.But.No need to worry. These brings an excellent opportunity.These events - altogether - create a fear among Investors. Fear creates panic and people started selling off their shares. High sell-off resulted in price fall.Great investment opportunity comes when excellent companies surrounded by unusual circumstances causing price to misapraised. Long term underlying value of the stock is still intact. However, in short term the market will be like voting machine.This is the right to start your shopping. Acquire more of what you already have in your portfolio.That is why, keep some amount of cash always ready with you for such golden events.See. Berkshire Hathaway (managed by Warren Buffett) have $85 billion cash on its books as of Sept 30. That’s truckload of money WB have for uncertain events. I use to keep around 15% of my portfolio in cash ready form.So don’t invest all of your money in stock market in a one go. Keep some cash in bank.The big money is not in the buying and selling… but in the waiting. Investing is all about waiting for the best opportunity and when you got one, never let it go. Just pull the trigger.Agree?. . .I write at Sowmayjain.com where I share everything I know about stock market."

297,"The puppet wasn’t inferior. It is actually a more ‘realistic’ puppet, and it was of course puppeted by the same performer (Frank Oz).The problem was that they couldn’t get it to look like the original Yoda and/or they chose to make it look a little different to show Yoda’s age difference (which makes no sense…it would be the equivalent of de-aging an 80-year-old human to make them look 77). It is possible that the puppet was a last-minute change when they realised they couldn’t do the digital version. The Nemoidian characters were planned to be CG with a similar body shape to the battle droids, but were changed to ‘men in rubber masks’ to either cut costs or make shooting easier. The Geonosians in Episode II are based on the original Nemoidian designs (notice that the Geonosians look a lot like the battle droids they created). The same might have happened with Yoda.The visual effects guys wanted to do Yoda digitally, but couldn’t get it to work. In The Phantom Menace they were able to get Jar Jar, Watto, etc. looking great because they were new characters, whereas recreating Yoda digitally would have needed to be much better to convince the audience they were watching a character they have seen many times before. It would be interesting to see the early Yoda CG attempts.It sounds like Lucas wasn’t happy with the digital version of Yoda until late in production of Attack of the Clones. In the making of documentary you can see how much work went into creating the digital Yoda. It’s quite an interesting documentary. They also talk about it on the DVD commentary.The digital version is definitely an improvement in the tweaked edition of The Phantom Menace, and it’s weird that they did such a poor job of recreating the original character for the puppet, especially considering how loved the character is."

299,"To those who haven't traveled in an non air-conditioned railway coach (generally referred to as a sleeper coach) in India, I apologize for my choice of metaphor here. To give a bit of a background, more than half the reserved coaches in India are non-AC. They are generally messier, filthier, hotter, more crowded, and generally more of an unpleasant experience than their air conditioned counterparts.Imagine such a journey. You board the train at 8 AM in the morning, settle down, and feel yourself being slowly engulfed with excitement and hopeful anticipation. It is going to be a long trip; 24 hours to be precise. But the prospect of going back to your hometown, or seeing your lover after a long time, or starting a new chapter in a strange city, or any of the multitude of reasons you undertook this voyage, would certainly make up for it. Its almost noon. Things have been smooth for the past 4 hours. The weather's fine, but it is definitely getting hotter. Your coach is only ~50% occupied. You have already finished the book you had purchased earlier, at the onset of the journey. To be fair, it was a disappointment. However, it did help you kill a few hours. But you are no longer in the mood to read more, so you do not take out the second one, letting it sit idly in your backpack, hopefully to be picked up during the return leg.The first big station arrives. A great human wave overwhelms your compartment. In a few minutes, when the commotion subsides, and the train resumes nonchalantly, you realize that there are now more people than seats. A lot of people without the proper reservations have also got in. But being in India, there is nothing much you can do about it. An elderly gentleman comes up to you and asks you to shift a bit to accommodate him. You are well within your rights to refuse, but you don't want to sound rude. So you comply; you adjust. Another 3 hours pass by. The heat has become unbearable. You curse our little, ordinary, yellow star. You notice that another young man has somehow sneaked into your seat. Originally meant to seat 3, it now is carrying 5. There isn't enough room for you to get comfortable. Not fair, you think. After all you planned your travel in advance and paid for the seat. So you take a stand, and politely ask the gentleman to leave. It's 6 PM now. The sun has started to go down. You have become accustomed to the crowd, the crying children, the noisy group of teenagers in the next compartment, and everything else. The guy you had asked to leave earlier comes back, walks up to you, and apologizes. He is a student, who had to suddenly leave for home due to a personal emergency. He says his stop is next. And that he is terribly sorry for the inconvenience he caused you. You feel like an ass. You realize you had been a terrible person. You blurt out your apology too, hoping to make up for your earlier blunder. You offer him half you seat until his journey ends. You start talking. He is a good kid. 30 minutes or so fly by in what felt like a jiffy. You bid adieu but not without adding him on Facebook. You just made a friend. 7 PM and you are gazing our of the window. The cool counter-breeze is a welcome relief after the sun's unsolicited display of strength earlier that day. The scenery is wonderful too. Lush green fields, small lakes and ponds, a tiny creek, a rustic little settlement. You can almost feel the languid rural life calling out to you, a stark contrast against the hectic pace of the city. Is that regret you are feeling?Anyway, back to the present. Some of the scenery is so beautiful, you wish you could stop and admire it for a few moments more. But like Frost's reminiscence of a fateful winter evening passing through the woods, or Wordsworth's vivid memoirs of gazing upon a daffodil field, you know it isn't possible. Everything comes, stays for a while, and then leaves. Nothing is permanent. With that thought, both distressing and comforting, you eat your dinner and go to sleep. You wake up at 6 AM the next morning, mostly infuriated by the commotion in the coach. To your pleasant surprise, you find a cute girl sitting across from your seat. Being shy, you simply take out the second book and start reading. A few minutes later, the lady interrupts you inquiring about the said book. Not a bad investment, you think. One thing leads to another, and you soon find yourself in the midst of a wonderful conversation. You are pleasantly surprised to discover that the two of you work in the same city, belong to the same town, and have overlapping interests in most cases. ""Could this be love?"", you heart asks. ""Let's not get ahead of ourselves."", your brain replies. However, it definitely could be the beginning of something wonderful. You exchange numbers and outline some vague plans to catch up soon.The journey is coming to an end. You feel both relieved and a bit nostalgic. You are where you wanted to be, but in the process you will have to let go of the past 24 hours. That is life. A journey. A series of events, some memorable some not. An emotional roller-coaster of joy, sadness, excitement, disappointment. A constant battle between being a little sympathetic and understanding vs standing your ground. Friendship. Love. An elapsing sequence of scenes, of moments, of memories. All of them fleeting. Permanently. Irrevocably. The final destination for all is the same - irrespective of power, wealth, beauty, ambition. Death is the eventual finality that we all need to embrace and accept. However, it's the ephemeral nanosecond in the cosmic calendar, where you exist, that is all that matters. "
300,"I started a real estate business at the age 19 without any of the advice from anyone if I was given the following advice I would have easily avoided tons of hard work and failure. I went on to start 2 other successful startups and now helping a friend make his own. At this moment I work as a consultant. Below are some advice which I learned the hardest way .. there is a small secret in the end of the read..Make sure you are on board - what do I mean with this? What I mean is that, You need to get excited and the idea of business should make you go crazy happy and full of opportunities. You are the face of business people will follow you if you yourself are convicted with this business idea.Hire trustworthy people- this is probably the hardest part of business. If you are growing into a big venture, bring in your friends whom you trust the most and who will be ready to do whatever you say for the business. Such people are very hard to find and most businesses fail at this point forward.Do your research- Now a days real invention are so rare that if someone makes a new invention people look at them like they discovered fire. So a good chance is that someone has already started what you are going to start. The best you can do in this situation is improvise on the idea and make a new product or service. Much better than anyone else.Don't be the man in middle- if you are thinking of working full-time and starting a business then you are in so much trouble. The venture which will take 2 years to build will take 8 years because you are dedicating 40 hours per week to your full-time job. Quit either of the things and focus on one.It takes money to make money- Back in the day when Jesus was alive it took a lot of capital to start your business. But in today's age with a smart phone and internet you can start so many crowdfunding programs that the limit is infinite. Plus you also have access to thousands of venture capitalist who will invest in your idea. Those who tell you that you need to have a lot of money to start your business have probably started their business back in the 60s.Never give up- easier said than done. When I first started my real estate business in Mumbai. I woke up at 4:30am took the train at 5am and went 15km to churchgate(downtown Mumbai) opened my office where I worked alone and from 7am till 3pm cold called everyone on my call list to buy an apartment. Rejections were the maximum amount but those who accepted my cold calls and bought the apartment are the reason why the business ran so well.Remove the negatives- Look business and startup is a very energy draining job. The last thing you want is negative things or people brining you down. If you are really invested in the business then you will start seeing people leave you. Don't worry they will be replaced by much better ones. But it's your job to tune out the negatives.Don't forget to enjoy - have 12 hours/week for yourself. Don't do anything during that time related to business. Focus on other important things like family and me time! You won't get this again once your business takes off.Go to Investopedia - Sharper Insight. Smarter Investing. and Entrepreneur - Start, run and grow your business. to gain some knowledge about financial terms. Make that your vocabulary, you will need it to understand business and talk to businessmen as that's the language of business.Dress professionally- this goes long way because in today's world people view you by the way you dress. OK I understand that you are thinking about that Facebook dude who wore a t-shirt and hoodie. Well this is not the birth of internet and you are not the founder of FB and twitter. In real business which involves extremely smart people, self confidence and charm along with physical appearance plays a key role.Remember you are the leader and influencer don't let anyone take that position from you no matter who it is.Here comes the secret- Most people in this world, 96% will say that they want to start their own business but has it ever occurred to you why only the top 4% make it to the finish line?? Well let me tell you, it's because 96% people will never put the amount of work which the 4% puts in. You need to decide which side of the spectrum you are on.Cheers and happy venturing!!!"
301,"Start with a cleanse.Throw out the story of your life if you are not a hero in it. Buy a beautiful, brand new notebook. On the very first crisp, clean, blank page, write out your story. Take an objective look. Is it sad? Is it angry? Are you unlucky? Does it blame everyone else? Are you a victim? Do you have a sense of agency or do things seem to happen to you?On the next page, change something. Own up to something. Be more accountable. Be more powerful. You have a whole notebook to page by page change your portrayal of the story of your life.As the story in your notebook changes, notice the shifts in your real life.Stop bad-mouthing you. Does your inner voice criticize you, put you down? Can you really work on something if your enemy is on the inside? If you are talking to yourself in a way that you would never speak to someone else, shut that shit down.Don’t spend any time with people who are not good for you. Is there anyone in your life constantly putting you down? Anyone you feel is toxic? Is anyone draining your energy? Do you have “frenemies” and can’t explain why? You are fully responsible for the people you surround yourself with.Stop comparing yourself to others. When you tell yourself someone has it better than you, you are never even getting the full picture. Focus on the work you have to do on yourself. Inside. Look inside. Inside is where it’s at. Not outside.Don’t carry things that weigh you down. Are you feeling bitterness, anger, resentment, a drive for revenge? These things are the same as trying to get through a desert carrying poison instead of water. Throw it out. Let it go. Put it down. Forgive.Forever give up on getting anything perfect. Instead, take risks. Do a terrible job and watch what happens. (I’ll just tell you. Ready? Nothing. Nothing happens.) Every day, be absolutely relentless about learning something new.Say no to things you don’t want to do. This will often be met with disapproval. It might result in you losing some of those frenemies we talked about earlier. But, it will open up more time for you to do the things you need to.There. Now that you have more time, more energy and a new perspective, here are some things to add to your life.Nurture the glorious people who love you. Give them two things. Your time, and your full, complete attention.Come into the fact that you’re the boss. Forget about approval, what people will say or the fear of possibly making a mistake. (I’ll just tell you. Ready? You will. You will definitely make a mistake.) What do you really want? What do you really want to do? Be your boss. You are your boss. Own up to it.Make a list of things you are good at. In that same notebook that contains the evolving story of your life, make a list of things you are good at, or a list of things that fill you with pleasure. Do more of those things. They can make you feel competent (I’m a good listener!) or they can make you feel happy (I love walking barefoot in the grass!) Either way, discover, collect, list, repeat.Make a list of things you find challenging. By “challenging” I don’t mean “likely to cause you bodily harm”. I mean things that make you uncomfortable that you know you need to do. Walk up and talk to a stranger. Ask someone out. Speak up. Develop opinions. Check off every single thing on your list. Start small. Start big. Either way, feel proud of all the times you did things you thought you couldn’t do.Learn to accept compliments. One of the great ironies of life is that it feels like criticism has a special, VIP pass right into our soul and compliments are not allowed in until they show ID and then upon inspection are asked to leave immediately. Let them in. Say thank you.Take care of yourself. For me, this means eating better. Working at getting more sleep. Exercising regularly. Making a commitment to getting into shape does wonders for your self-esteem, teaches you about discipline, perseverance, dedication, and facing challenges. So much goodness rolled into a single objective.Practice being a better person. Be kinder and more considerate. Do what you think is right. Every time I am mean, petty, cruel, dishonest, I suffer more than anyone. Other people get to walk away from me. I can’t get away from myself.Realize you have every kind of resource at your fingertips. If I am feeling blue, irritated, anxious, tired, I get help. I go to a yoga class. I read a book. I talk to someone I love. I find solace in the kindness of strangers. I go for a walk and make it a point to appreciate the color of the sky. I notice things around me that are there to support me if I fall.I mean, even my seat cushion can be used as a flotation device."
302,"No! Not at all.I don't know what's your age, but let me give you the secret of life. Which I have experienced seeing around.At the age of 17,We feel love is more important in life.At the age of 19,We feel friends are more important.At the age of 22,We feel job is more important.At the age of 25,We feel money is more important.At the age of 30,We feel family is more important.At the age of 40,We feel time is more important.At the age of 50,We feel health is more important.At the age of 60,We feel life is important.Our priorities changes with time. Friends are only meant for schools and colleges. No one will be there to help you after that. Learn to survive alone.If you have money, friends and relatives will be there with you. If you don't have money no one care about you except your parents.Friends are just a part of life, not a life. Don't feel bad, because you don't have one to accompany to shopping, film or long drive.Loneliness kills, but once you get adjusted with it, trust me it is a bliss.Spend more time with yourself. Everyone is selfish around you.See, today I don't have any friend. When I was in college I used to have many friends. We used to bunk, we used to make all sorts of fun in college.Today, I get adjusted with my lifestyle. My so called friends are busy in their personal life.“Don't put the key of your happiness in someone else's pocket.”I'm alone and I'm happy. This is what I do if I get bored,I watch movies in theatre alone.I go for a short ride in the evening.I listen to music.I read books.I flirt.I watch inspirational speech from YouTube.I write on Quora.I go for a walk in park.I prepare for my government exams.“My dear brothers and darlings of Quora.” :pKeep yourself busy, then you don't need any friends for life. An empty mind is a devils workshop.You don't need friends to be happy, you can be happy being alone, trust me.Be alone to be happy, be happy to be alone.(Your little appreciation and honest feedback makes me write even more. A person who feels appreciated will always do more than expected.)Thanks for reading, Yours,Rakshith Akira ✍"
303,"Most theories I’ve heard go like “you know you can’t prove you exist so we don’t exist”. I’m going to attempt to answer this question a bit differently.Try to imagine, and bear with me:All of you live in my world. Every single one of you out there is simply just a projection with a single purpose: to exist in and shape the world that’s been created for the only real, conscious individual: me.I too don’t actually exist in this world. I’m asleep. Each one of you is just complicated NPCs created for the projection of me to live in this seemingly elaborate world.This reality which I’ve created is so intricate that my higher* mind has built stories and personalities for each single one of you in the world. Existence, physics, universe, logic, life, people, emotion, thoughts, events, inventions, media: everything has been invented by the higher me for the only single person who’s actually alive, the person who’s mind has created everything you and I know.The world didn’t exist before I was born. When I gained consciousness, my higher mind began creating everything around me and intricate causes and details for the existence of each, like stories, history, events and everything I could possibly access and believe.If you’ve lost me here, imagine this: it’s the first time I’m seeing food. My mind is confused and I start to try to find out why food has come to exist and works the way it does. My mind slowly starts to grasp the idea of creating reality the way it is as my ability to grasp bigger concepts improves. The definition of food, over the years, changes from basic like “something that comes from my mother” (a primitive explanation) to “something that grows on trees, caused by complex biological processes” (a more elaborate, mature explanation). To explain everything I come in contact with, my higher mind creates history, people, tastes, thoughts, books and everything that I would possibly need to believe that I’m not in a dream and the things I see aren’t inexplicable anomalies.Over the years, my mind matures to create more complex explanations for everything and everything feels more real. Miracles no longer feel like they exist. I further fall into the dream, unawares.I’m in a dream that’s trying to convince me that I’m not in one. Yet, I’m in one that’s trying to kill me and wake me up. My current state of consciousness seems to be caused by conflict and indecisiveness… and the moment my mind decides that it’s finally time to wake up, when my mind finally picks a side, I die. It could happen now. It could happen in hundreds of years. But everything I know and will come to know will be created only by my constantly growing mind.Prove me wrong. I bet each one of you would try to tell me that you’re real, that you can make decisions and shape the world too. But you’re just in my dream. You’re just telling me that to make me believe I actually exist. You’re doing this because my higher mind gave you the power and characteristics to define my world and make it the way it is. Your opinion is nothing more than just another little, insignificant lie created to assure my wretched existence.None of you exist. Each one of you are nothing more than a tiny reason for my world to exist the way it does.—In my answer, the word “higher” means my higher state of consciousness or the mind that created me and this reality. I couldn’t think of a better word to define what I had in mind.Edit: I finally edited out some glaring grammatical errors from the answer."

308,"There’s a bromide among mathematicians about calculus texts: They are all isomorphic. The term “isomorphic” roughly means that not only do two things have the same - or pretty much indistinguishable - objects (content), but the relations between the objects are the same as well.So if it’s big, thick and says “Calculus” (bummer on that 3rd count girls) - it’s a duck.I’ll cautiously recommend a terrible book on calculus. It’s small and thin: Calculus Made Easy by Silvanus Thompson. It was written way back in 1910 by a Brit who delights in repeating “What one fool can learn, another can.”The big stumbling block(s) in calculus is/are the concepts of “limits” and “continuity”. It’s the rare student that “gets it” the first time around. And I would say that is mostly because it can be made to sound very simple and reasonable by a skilled instructor. Thompson’s introduction to these concepts in about the first 20 pages is not, for my two cents, easy reading and doesn’t help that much. I got through it and most of the rest of the book seemed a breeze. Once he quit blathering about limits “in theory” and actually started using the concepts intuitively on the big problems of calculus (slope and area) - very easy reading.I read it cover to cover and it let me successfully challenge all but the last calculus class while going straight into differential equations. Two full years of math my first quarter. With that stellar start, I went down hard when I tried to move on to advanced calculus. If you want to be a mathematician, that should be a consideration. If you just want to learn the nuts and bolts of calculus with a crude idea of why it all works, Thompson’s book is OK or even fantastic.I’ll add there is one more thing that is critical to success in calculus: Algebra skills. If your ability to manipulate algebraic expressions (accurately) isn’t good to excellent - no calculus book ever written will help you.Good luck!"
309,"That is an answer for the ages… We've all had good and bad exes, and the appropriate stories of the ups and downs… Sometimes, the method of doing it can lead to friendship whilst other times to hardship.I can share a few stories with you:A girlfriend of 1.5 years: She and I talked due to our lack of communication and my unadulterated love for sports. She told me to pick and I decided for my sport.A girlfriend of 1.5 years: She was receiving messages from another guy and I wouldn't tolerate it… I told her that if he wants to tell her that he loves her, then I'm out of the picture. She gave excuses why it happened. And I didn't care… I drove off but I looked back in the mirror to see her crying… We lasted another 3 months before we mutually ended it.A girlfriend of 2 years: I took her out to a beach side in the evening and sat her down to tell her that it was over due to me falling out of love with her… She climbed out of my car window, started screaming for God to strike her with lightning and for me to run her over with my car… Eventually, people came over and I moved away cause they might have thought I was raping her… The only way to get her home was me accepting for a one month break, where I wanted total radio silence, and I pushed her away even more. I still loved her but the relationship was not going the right way.A girlfriend of 1 year: She never talked about her feelings and I would have to reach down her throat to pull them out. She eventually admitted that she loved me but there were so many things wrong with our relationship and I agreed. Then she proceeded to say that she wants to commit suicide, to which I said it's over. Then she curled in a ball on the floor crying (as she always did to manipulate me) and we had make-up sex but nothing ever changed. She kept wanting to change me, then we broke up for the same reasons via a post-exam meeting, where I told her I was done and she curled in a ball again. Crying and screaming. I was stared at by the whole bar…Relationships are never easy to form… even harder to end…"

314,"This question has been asked on Quora multiple times and I have also answered similar other questions before. Hence today instead of writing the same steps of analyzing one’s career, I will give an example which will help you understand predicting the career of the person using the birth chart alone :-Chart 1 :-Always, Start with the 10th house and see if there is a planet in the 10th House. Since in this case there is no planet in the 10th house we will just check the ruler of the 10th house and move to the next step. 10th house ruler in this case is Mars.Check where is mars sitting in the chart and what are the influences wherever Mars is sitting.Mars is sitting in the third house of courage, efforts, communication. So, the profession may have something to do with these things. Since Mars also represents sports we can also keep that as a possibility. Finally Since mars is a malefic we must always keep technical profession in Mind. Next check what are the planets influencing the house.In this case Ketu is sitting with mars, so it will have the maximum influence. Ketu represents mathematical abilities and also research. You can also try and understand how Jupiter and Rahu will influence the career, I am leaving that to the readers.So, till now we have sports, communication related profession or a technical profession with some form of research involved.Next check the sign in which Mars is placed and recollect what does it signify. You will find in the charts of sports person that the sign of virgo is significant so this person can actually be in sports. One other important signification of Virgo is Analytics which is technical and since the person in this field is working on data and drawing inferences it has research associated with it. So, we still have the dilemma Sports or analytics.Here the fact that the person is a cancer ascendant can give you a clue that he/she may not be physically that strong to be in sports. Though please do not take this as a generic statement. Presence of mars in the ascendant can make someone very athletic even if the native is cancer ascendant.Also, Mars itself is not so strong in this chart as it is on the rahu ketu axis and in the sign of its enemy Mercury. So we can think that sports as a career seems unlikely. But we will verify that in the next step.Check where Mars is placed in the Navamsa- In the case of this native mars is in the sign of Virgo, hence analytics is still a possibility. On the other hand let us say mars had moved into the Navamsa of Aries then sports would have again come into the picture. Because that would have made mars stronger for sports related activities.we can move onto the Dasamsa and further verify our conclusion but here the analysis done so far is sufficient to understand the career possibilities.Note##- Please do not think that virgo only represents - sports and analytics it represents many other things; but since I cannot run you through to all the possibilities I gave the significations of virgo which are related to this chart.Also, if you remember I also mentioned that the third house also represents communication, so this native actually has to make presentations based on the findings and present it to the client. He is a Data scientist and works extensively on data modeling. Here if we could have found the education first and then went on to career our job would have been much easier. In some other post I would do that as well. This person has a Masters degree in Statistics.Example 2 :-10th House has a planet in this case, so we could straight away ask the native - Has your profession got something to do with Management.Next observation - Jupiter is ruling the 8th house. So probably a lot of research is involved in his daily activities. ** Having 8th lord in the 10th is not always bad. If a person has 8th lord in the 10th that can indicate a career in research related fields. And yes, in other cases it can also indicate troubles during early years in the career or rise after someone else’s downfall etc….because the list is endless.Moving on the sign placed in the 10th house is that of Saturn and that too aquarius hence we can infer that the person is involved in some technical job.Saturn has gone into the 2nd house in the sign of Gemini(Communication) alongwith Mars (Technical planet-Engineering). So , my prediction for this person was are you into a technical job which involves some degree of research and management. I was unable to understand what how exactly second house is influencing his profession. I did not check navamsa etc. for profession in this case as I could sense the profession is technical. He said he is into manufacturing RAMs.Let us do some reverse engineering - RAM is used to store information. What is second house - It is the house of resources, apart from other things like eyes, wealth, family, food etc. So, Can we say that RAM is used to store resources ( Second house) for future use. But can someone ever predict a career where someone is manufacturing RAMs - Let me be honest , I cannot do that.It is always easy to backtrack and learn things but since there are so many professions available these days it is next to impossible to totally pin point the exact profession. Let us say in this case if the person had venus in the second house, then we could have said - Do you own restaurant or are you in the catering business or working as a cook?So, basically this is how you predict profession of an individual. I will present more examples if needed. Knowingly I presented examples where the profession was difficult to predict; In most of the cases it is not so difficult.Now, if you are learning astrology, What you should do to identify profession of an individual, Learn the significations of the following ;-HousesPlanetsSigns.Yes, basics. If you can understand these three things you can very easily identify few professions which the individual might be involved in, and then based on the background and education of the person you can arrive at the exact profession or at least be able to tell the nature of work the individual might be doing.In case you have any specific profession which you want to analyse then please leave that in the comment section and I will try to tell the houses, signs and planets which will be involved in those cases. Also, If you want me to present charts where I failed to pinpoint the prediction I will be happy to do that. In those cases I missed the dasha that the individual was running as they play an extremely important role.Hope this helps!"

317,"Countries do two very important things. They become more open. The build relationships among rest of the countries in the world and try to be part of one world. They do it through trade, partnerships and through human relationships, arts etc.They have to govern their countries well and satisfy their people's aspirationsThey strengthen their internal defense. Their intention is that their internal and external forces don't threaten their governments.Being a responsible member of United Nations that works well to ensure peace in the world.The above don't ensure that they can successfully prevent war. If relationships between countries are not strong, it could lead to war. They should have open trade. Trade is opposed to war. So, all countries should trade and interact with other countries well.There is no need to stress about the importance of good governance. When the leaders of the country don't govern well, people in the countries may revolt. While it is important for countries to strengthen their internal defense, it is not good if the military strength becomes too strong. Because some eccentric leaders may decide to misuse it. Which is why we need the fourth point - A strong United nations with responsible members will be capable of ensuring peace in the world. It requires some reforms in the United nations.This is something I believe: We need a strong country like US to be the police of the world. Without it some dictators will torment their people or unnecessarily wage war against other countries. Of course, the global policeman should have some kind of a control. Presently the citizens of USA can keep a check on their leaders. But it is not most effective. What is required is some reforms in UN so that there is good democracy in it."

Next, he’s going after Guinea worm disease.If the only place you want to direct the money is into your own pocket, you’ll never think broad enough to reach a billion.“To make a billion dollars, help a billion people.” – Peter Diamandis2. What’s your real reason for wanting to make a billion?Now that we’ve got the noble cause out of the way, why do you really need the money? What happiness can a billion buy you that 100 million can’t? That 10 million can’t? That one million can’t?It’s just another arbitrary number. What’s not arbitrary is the psychological hole you’re hoping it’ll fill. Where’s the hole?Are you insecure? Lonely? Do you lack self-worth? Self-love? Who do you want to prove wrong? Yourself? The world?It’s okay. Just like the idea of becoming a billionaire itself, when you dig deep enough, you’ll realize it’s there. We all have it. But know it’s there.“There’s always a good reason and there’s always a real reason.” – James Altucher3. How are you going to make your billion?Seriously. Do the math. The real, serious math. We’re not talking about revenue here. We’re talking about profit. Profit you can pocket.What does a billionaires bank account even look like? Is there ever a billion on there? I have no idea. And neither do you.Only 3% of billionaires made their money from running private companies. Can you take a company from zero to IPO? How big is your total market? Is there even a billion in there?“If past history was all there was to the game, the richest people would be librarians.”– Warren Buffett4. Who’s going to make your billion for you?That’s right. Not with you. For you. You have to be aware that in the end, that’s what’s happening. Everyone you hire along your journey will partly be responsible for making your billion. And you will hire people. You have to.These people will work with you. But they’ll make money for you. Tell me: Why should they? Tell them. You better have a compelling reason. A good offer.What are you going to give back? What are you going to do for them?“Help young people. Help small guys. Because small guys will be big.” – Jack Ma5. When do you expect your billion?If the answer is anything less than 20 years from now, you can stop right here. Warren Buffett became a millionaire just before turning 30. He first was a billionaire at 56. That’s 26 years, starting from millionaire status.Are you a millionaire yet? No? Whoops. That’s just the first part. But even that’s ridiculously hard.And don’t you dare tell me about Mark Zuckerberg. You’re not Mark Zuckerberg. Mark Zuckerberg isn’t reading this. Neither would you be, if you were already seriously working on your billion.“I’m here to build something for the long-term. Anything else is a distraction.” – Mark Zuckerberg6. What are you willing to give up for your billion?If being a billionaire is your number one goal, think about number two. You will not get number two. Or three. Or four. The bigger the goal, the bigger the sacrifice.0.0000272% of all humans are billionaires. They gave up not one, but all the things that make the other 99.99% of people what they are - the other 99.99% of the people.Whatever you think you can also have, next to being a billionaire, you most likely can’t. We’re not talking about giving up watching football here.Are you willing to be a bad father for your billion? An absent mother? Are you willing to lose your girlfriend? Or all your friends? Would you give up family? Sleep? Food for a week?Most importantly: Are you willing to give up being understood by every single person you know?“I was set free, because my greatest fear had already been realized, and I was still alive, and I still had a daughter whom I adored, and I had an old typewriter and a big idea. And so rock bottom became the solid foundation on which I rebuilt my life.” – J.K. RowlingPrivilege is a sweet syrup. There’s lots to gain from savoring it. Delusion is the bitter taste it leaves in your mouth when you get used to it.So here’s one last piece of bark to chew on. As of 2017, there are 2,043 billionaires in the world.How many of them do you think started with dreaming about being a billionaire?Sources[1] Fear{less} with Tim Ferriss[2] 2015 Gates Annual Letter[3] American Billionaires And Their Private Company Fortunes[4] The Age When 17 Self-Made Billionaires Earned Their First Million[Image] Warren Buffett is 'one-quarter Coca-Cola'PS: I write more articles like this one each week and send them out in Nik’s Newsletter.

319,"The answer to this question heavily depends on your background and your learning goals. Specifically,Are you brand new to programming, have dabbled a bit in programming, or are you currently a programmer in a different field?Are you learning for fun or hobby, or are you looking to break into software development as a career, within a time frame of, say, 6-12 months?Let's break it down:If you're a current practicing programmer and want to learn web development for fun and expand your horizon, I'd recommend the following:Consider learning a new language that's very different from your current working language. For example, if you're a C programmer, learn a high level, dynamic language such as Ruby; If you're android developer using Java, check out a functional language such as Clojure or Erlang/Elixir. Those languages will open your mind and help you grow as a developer. Go find books or courses that are written by developers for developers, for example, Zed Shaw's ""Learn Code the Hard Way"" series is pretty good; Pragmatic Bookshelf and No Starch Press also have books for experienced developers. Do some code exercises or take on a simple project to practice with the new language (For example, Dave Thomas writes a Markdown parser whenever he learns a new language). You should be productive with the language in a few days.Find project-based courses that take you along to build apps, oftentimes with a framework. Once you learn the language, you can probably get to frameworks quickly, and troubleshoot as you go with Google or Stack Overflow. As an experienced developer you probably constantly get distracted by new tech, therefore being able to quickly put things together will keep you motivated and entertained, so you can keep going.If you're a current practicing programmer who wants to transition into web development professionallyIf you have software development experience in other fields, when you look for jobs the expectation is typically that you will be able to quickly ramp up and contribute, and can work as an intermediate level web developer. To prepare to meet this expectation, your learning focus shouldn't be ""fun"" and ""personal growth"" focused like the first scenario, but to aim to have a thorough understanding of the web stack and the current best practices of a development stack.If possible, pick a language that's closer to your current working language, and one with lots of job opportunities. As of this writing, I'd consider Java, JavaScript, Ruby and Python. If you already program in one of these languages, stick with that and learn it really well. I don't find lots of online courses that teach languages beyond the beginner level, so I'd suggest that you pick up a ""canonical book"" of your language of choice. (see a list below)Learn the foundations of web development concepts: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, HTTP and databases. This is an important step - don't jump into frameworks right away. This is the foundation that all web development practices are based on, so if you have good understanding of these topics, getting into the higher level abstractions of frameworks is going to be much easier, and you'll find that you have a lot less to memorize, because you understand the core web machinery. (see a list of learning resources below)If you want to become a professional web developer, you have to have a solid understanding in the fundamentals. Udacity has a great course that covers this level you should check out: Web Development Online Course .Learn the leading stack in your language of choice (Grails, Node/Express/Angular/React, Ruby on Rails, Django) and study the abstractions. As an experienced developer, employers will expect you to be not just a user of frameworks, but can have deeper conceptual understanding and can bend them to your own will. Don't stay on the surface, it's important to understand how frameworks map ..."

321,"Q. How will the ban on 500₹ and 1000₹ impact Indian economy?There are already a lot of great answers for this question. I would like to keep it short and precise:-Pros:-Many black money holders will be under radar: People who have black money are mostly in pithole. Either they have to go to banks to exchange their money into new forms of notes and get under the government radar. Else they forget the money because it will turn into useless paper soon.The West Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee is so worried. She tweeted and asked to “withdraw this draconian decision”. Obviously she should be worried. Her party MLAs have acquired lots of black money from Sarada Chit Fund issue.Current 500 and 1000 rupee notes can only be exchanged at banks. The exchange can be carried out by providing valid proofs like Adhar Card, PAN card or voting card. Bank will keep record of each details, so it will check whether the money is black money or not.Nullifying fake currency notes: As of April 29, 2016 fake notes worth Rs. 16.50 Lakh crore has been circulating in the country. Recent studies have suggested that fake notes of Rs. 70 crore are infused into the system every year and law enforcement are able to curb only one third of them. 90% of fake notes are released in bigger notes like 500 and 1000. So this step will nullify all the fake notes.Decrease inflation: If I have black money or I have fake notes, I can even pay Rs. 600 for an item costing Rs. 500. This is because, this money is not my hard earned money and I have enough fake money. When a person purchase an item by giving extra money, this increases the cost of the money. Hence inflation increases. With this step, black money and fake notes will be nullified. Hence it will impose a check on price inflation.National security will increase: A huge amount of black money is used in funding terrorism which is direct threat to the national security. This step will curb black money. Arms smuggling, terrorist activities, etc will be reduced. Hence activities like 26/11 or Uri attack will be reduced a lot due to lack of funding for terrorism. This will stop funding to Kashmiri separatists. This will also reduce the “pelting of stones” by Kashmiri kids and youths who are asked to throw stones for Rs. 100.Reduce crime carried out by underworld: The black money and fake currencies are used by underworld and mafia too. From abduction to killing contract to a sharp shooter, black money is used to fund crime too.Reduction in activities of Land mafia and real estate corruption: Black money are used by lot of people in real estate business. This hikes the price of real estate. This step would be beneficial in controlling inflation in property related transactions. Also, real estate sector would get institutionalized. When housing price would go down, this will force the demand of reviving the sluggish housing segment.Reduction of inflation will be overall: Inflation are always overall. So reduction of inflation will be overall too including Higher studies and medical treatments.Cashless transaction will be encouraged: The new limits on ATM withdrawals has been restricted to Rs 2,000 per day. Bank withdrawals have been limited to Rs 10,000 per day and Rs 20,000 per week. hence it will increase cashless transaction like online payment and card payments. Countries with more cashless transaction face very less fake note threats because most transactions are digitized. Since more transactions are digitized, they need less printed currency and low quality paper for currency notes. That’s why US dollars are of low and thinner paper quality and Indian rupee are better and thick paper quality comparatively. US spends less in printing currency notes than India.Since cashless transaction will be encouraged, it will reduce the use of printed currency and hence reduce the use of fake notes.Since cashless transactions are digitized, government will be able to keep track records.Less use of currency note means less cost in printing currency notes.Cons:-People will rush to ATMs and Banks to exchange 500 and 1000 rupee notes. People will try to withdraw as much money in 100 rupee notes from ATMs. Even to withdraw Rs. 2000, they will transact for 5 times withdrawing Rs. 400 each time to avoid Rs. 500. That what happened on 9th November night after the declaration.Many people, especially from the rural India, aren’t aware of the total fact. Suddenly they will realize that the 500 rupee note they are carrying is useless. If the village panchayat or administration could help them, then they might understand the scenario fully.Extra cost to replace all the existing 500 and 1000 rupee notes: Printing new notes needs money. Declaring old notes as invalid and putting new notes into system will cost a good amount. The details are discussed in this link. Scrapping Rs500, Rs1000 notes a costly ideaPeople with low working class will be slightly affected: Generally people like plumber, maids, manual scavengers, electricians don’t have huge amount of 500 or 1000 rupee note. They only convert them to bigger notes when they have to carry out transaction in large sums and those are rare. Other than that, they get money after the end of month and that in 500s. These people aren’t aware with procedures of bank, mostly. Moreover, it’s not easy for them to not go to their job and spend times by standing on queues in banks.India is not fully ready for cashless transaction: Regions like rural India, North East India, township areas, sub urban areas, etc aren’t modified enough to go for total cashless transactions. Many normal people of metropolitan cities too, are not fully computer literate and they are not fully accustomed with internet, or payTM, etc. Basically, a huge number of people are not accustomed with cashless transactions.Ineffective for black money stored in other forms: Corrupt politicians like Jayalalitha don’t store black money as liquid cash. She converts them into gold. People like Amitabh Bacchan keep black money as foreign currencies in foreign banks. This decision can’t force them to surrender black money.Opposition will misguide people to take political advantage: Due to short period of notice, many people aren’t aware of how to exchange the 500 and 1000 rupee note. Many people don’t even know that Hospitals, Air ticket booking counters, petrol pumps are accepting 500 and 1000 rupee note for 72 hours till 11th November. They will be easily misguided by other political parties for the upcoming UP election. On 9th November, I saw some interviews of common people taken by various news media. Some people appreciated the decision. Some were criticizing it with abusive words. A guy said- “I have 500 and 1000 rupee note. I need to purchase petrol but Petrol Pump isn’t accepting it”. An old man standing beside him said- “Government had said that petrol pumps and hospitals have been asked to accept 500 & 1000 rupee note till Nov 11”. The other guys started objecting by shouting so much that the old man couldn’t even complete his sentence. He was pushed back by them who were criticizing the decision. Basically these guys stopped the man from sharing some information and clearing people’s doubt.Some points to know:Government has given time from 10th Nov to 30th Dec to exchange 500 & 1000 rupee notes.Till 11th Nov, petrol pumps, hospitals, air ticket counters will accept 500 & 1000 rupee notes.No confirmation from RBI that new 2000 rupee notes has nano GPS chips.Conclusion:Earlier, many people were worried about black money and wanted GoI to take step to curb it. Now GoI has taken a serious step and some people are creating issue out of it for temporary difficulties that will prevail only for a week. RBI doesn’t give a damn to two days’ minor difficulties when a long term beneficial decision is to be made for stabilizing the economy of the nation.Instead of being impatient for two days’ inevitable difficulties, we should support this for the better economy of the nation.Jai Hind.I was asked to answer by User-12096777814958329195. Thanks to him."
322,"When our hunting-gathering ancestors started cooking food, thus having more time and energy to develop their brain’s frontal lobe, they started to “simulate the future,” asking, what if this and, what if that?The drawback was that it created a metaphysical angst. Who made the earthquake and the thunder? Where do we come from and where will we end up?To overcome it, he created stories. Thor’s hammer, a creation and an eternal after-life. But what is philosophy? For Socrates it was: never stop asking questions. As such, anyone writing a book about philosophy … has stopped being one! ;-)In one of his book, Stephen Hawking tells the story that, during one conference about black holes, a woman stood up saying: “That is not true! The earth rests on one gigantic frog!” Mr. Hawking then asked: “And on what does the frog rest on?” She said: “On an infinite pile of frogs!”Then Mr. Hawking goes on writing a book about black holes, and so on. At the end of the book he writes: “Of course, I can’t prove anything of this, no more than the lady with the frogs!”… wise words from a wise man. What is the philosophy of death? For my sake, it is Nietzsche’s Eternal Recurrence … but I am open to any other idea! ;-)"
323,"Because people are ignorant - no scientist, nutritionist, or biologist would say that.Carnivore means that an animals nutrients are provided mostly by animal sources - whether through predation or scavenging. It does not mean that they are obligate carnivores (cannot survive without meat in the diet) and it does not mean that they never eat plants. It means that as near as we can tell looking at wild counterparts diets (wolves), dentition, etc they are 100% carnivores.Dogs do have a gene that wolves do not have which allows for better absorption of nutrients from starchy plants (potatoes, rice, etc). However, this does not alter their classification as a carnivore.This is a deer - a classic herbivore. It is eating meat:This is a cat, an obligate carnivore that will die if not fed meat. It is eating a plant:This is a dog, it is a carnivore. It is eating pizza:Just because an animal can eat something does not reclassify them as a carnivore/omnivore/herbivore. You look at the behavior or the animals in the wild about what makes up the majority of their diet. Wild wolves, coyotes, etc, somes eat feces, insects, and wild fruits, but the vast majority of their nutritional needs are met by meat. You can buy your dog a “vegan kibble” and if it has the right and properly digestible nutrients the dog can survive, but that doesn’t make it a soy-a-vore."
324,"June, 2016:By this time, we had completed two years of our togetherness and were cruising very well for a future together. One sudden day, a guy drops to see her, the same guy chosen by her parents to be her future partner.Displeased by this suddenness, she showed anger towards her parents for not informing her in advance and taking things forward without her consent. When asked, she told me that her mother has asked her to meet him as a friend and then they will deny their offer.She met him, he was a pretty rich banker who was wealthy and showed up to be a good guy in front of her. Their numbers got exchanged and then began the cheating part.She showed disinterest after meeting him, told bad things about him and said that her parents are forcing her but she is strong. They started chatting over texts, he was already floored down by her beauty and she seemed to have not liked that guy at all. By this time, I had appeared in my SBI Mains and was waiting for my results.I cleared SBI Mains and was waiting for my interview dates. I went to Bhopal for my interview, came out of the room and called her since it went pretty well. I was hopeful of a selection and wanted to meet her since she was in the town.35 missed calls, 30 messages, 3 hours of wait and I left Bhopal with sadness wrapped over my face.Couple of days later, she revealed that she is getting married with the same guy. She told me that she was pressurized by her family to do so and was swear in by her grandparents for this guy. I believed in her story, she kept on blabbering all the stories and I kept believing. She told that she will break the alliance very soon, would reveal everything and I was kept hanging for few more days.More drama, verbal abuse and some well-crooked stories in coming days.Then came the twist.One fine day, I happened to visit her best friend’s bank for some personal work where she was employed and had no idea about our relationship at all. During conversation, it drifted towards my girlfriend and then she showed me something which swept away the floor beneath me, I still feel those nervy cramps in my body and a rush of anger and despondency crept in all over my face.She showed me a part of it, rest I took it on my own to know the truth. They had a WhatsApp group of three female friends and she was very happy about the marriage. In fact, she was taking a lot of interest in first night rituals, asking for suggestions on her apparels and fascinating about the gala wedding that was going to happen.That day, I found out that whatever she told me was a pure lie. Their meeting was arranged after informing her in advance, her parents had met the guy and she had given her green signal to meet him. If this was not enough, she showed extreme interest in that guy and when she revealed things to me, it had already been a month.The day I was informed about her decision to marry him, tickets, garden and everything was booked and I was foolishly swindled by her. Well, if that was not the end of it, she had spoken negatively about me in front of her friend and termed me as a guy who asked her out and she denied the offer at the outset.So, what it is like to be cheated upon in a relationship?Brutal, extremely brutal. The faith, the trust, the hopes, you lay down everything in a single person for two years and it just fades away in a moment. You feel screwed up from top to bottom, lose the whole of your self-respect and confidence and the question of “Why” keep troubling you day in day out.You feel devoid of energy, you lose all the trust and your eyes see suspicion in every act of people around you. To make things worse, if you never knew it coming, the reality hits you very hard and it becomes tough to cope up with the severity of it.Well, in the end, if you put all your trust into a single person, you either get the best person of your life or you learn a lesson.I got the latter one.RegardsA Nomadic BankerEdit: We share the same organization, the guy and me both."
325,"There is only one sure fire way to know if someone has blocked your number. If you have repeatedly sent texts and got no response then call the number. If your calls goes straight to voicemail then it probably means your number has been added to their “auto reject” list. That means your text messages will never come through to their phone and your calls go straight to voice mail. I’ve been forced to do this myself to obnoxious ex-girlfriends.However they can also be one of these losers that say “I just don’t have time to respond to texts” and those words are always spoken by lazy, disrespectful losers. If a persons life is SO busy that they don’t have 15–30 seconds to respond to a text then they don’t have time to wipe their butt after using the bathroom and if they don’t have time to wipe their butt then you definitely don’t want to hang out with them."
326,"The best food I have eaten is a very specific type of Idly called Mallige Idly. By this sentence most Indians will know that I am a south Indian. Anyway, almost a month back, there was a war going on twitter. Gordon Ramsay v/s South Indians. Just because he said our every day food which is Idly and vada looked like prison food for him.. Frankly speaking, it hurt me.. Because I am no prisoner and the food I eat is in fact so healthy that many hospitals serve them on a daily basis to its patients and many doctors recommend this to be consumed on a daily basis as it causes zero affect on health. But, I am least bothered as I know what Idly is made of and how tasty it is and he is the one who is at loss as he will never be able to taste what we taste.Moving on let me describe how this became my favorite food.. As long as i remember, my mom used to make terrible Idlies.. They were full of rava and i hated it (sorry mom). So I could hardly eat idly. But, it was twice a week mandatory breakfast at our place.. we had to eat it as breakfast and then take it to school for lunch.. But, at school i would eat other’s lunch to satisfy my taste buds..I am from Mysore, so the famous festival Dasara gives us a lot of opportunity to have variety of food.. There will be fair and exhibits of lot of stuff which can be bought and also lot of tasty food.. Its called “Mysuru Dasara exhibition”.We used to go there every year as there will be lot of games to play for children (which I wanted to to back then). When I was 9 or 10 years old we were walking in the exhibition, looking around for something exciting to eat with my mom and my brother.. My mom saw that there is a stall of “Mysore Mallige Idly”. So she took us there. She ordered 2 plates of Mallige Idly. One for her and me and one more for my elder brother.. As I used to waste a lot of food back then, she wanted me to taste it first..Maillige idly usually will be served with 2 or 3 types of chutney as shown in the below photo.But, the size and shape of the mallige idly was not like the one in the photo. Just to give you a rough idea.. Have a look at the below picture which shows the thickness of a idly.But, a mallige idly will be 1.5 times thicker that the one in the picture. A lot softer, in fact it will be so soft few people call it sponge idly.. literally it will be like a sponge if to try squeezing it.. but it will not be chewey at all.. it will just melt in the mouth..So, continuing the story. My mom smeared some red chutney and some green chutney and a broken piece of Mallige idly and gave it to me for tasting.. Just for me to decide, if I wanted it or not.. I just put it in my mouth and the flavours of red chilly, ginger, garlic, coconut, coriander, curry leaves, Roasted gram (Hurigadale), with occasional encounter of muster seeds, along with all these the the soft soft mallige idly started bursting in my mouth.. It just melted like butter in my mouth.. I felt like i just visited heaven..I had never tasted anything like that before.. So, i ended up eating 3 or 4 plates of mallige idly that day.. My mom had to call it a day and drag me out of that place..Since then, my mom kept trying and trying to make those idlies. But, till date she hasn’t been successful.. But, the idly of hers has improved a lot.. now i like my mom’s idlies..But, after that, over the period of several years, I have tried Mallige idlies at several places none of them were like the one that i ate that day.. I used to hunt for Mallige idlies in and around mysore but, dint find anything even close to that.. One of my uncle said there is one place near pandavapura (Mandya district) where, in a small house one old man prepares mini idlies which tastes similar to mallige idly.. Immediately I told my dad (he is my partner for all kinds of food exploration, we always keep each other updated on “New good places to eat in Mysore” he is a big time foodie) that we should go there.. so the next day morning we left mysore by 6 am rode on a two wheeler for almost 40 kms (approx) for few plates of Idly.. But, trust me it was worth it.. we enjoyed the journey and the food was amazing (Not a mallige idly. But, fantastic idlies) I would have eaten 3 -4 plates there too..So there it is the best food ever eaten..P.S: I am still searching on the Dasara Exhibitions every year to find that perfect mallige idly. So far I have not been successful.. Anyone knows any place in Bangalore or Mysore which serves awesome mallige idly.. Please let me know.. A hungry soul is waiting to be satisfied."

Clearly, audiences and users consume and interact with content for many different purposes and on an increasing variety of media platforms. For example, mobile devices are becoming very significant. They are replacing /have replaced the TV in many parts of the world as the number one way we get news and entertainment.However, when people talk about “journalism’ they often have a unitary definition in mind. That is to say, they think of the classic ‘public service’ journalism model represented by well known names such as Woodward and Bernstein - ‘All The Presidents Men’. This type of investigative reporting that may appear in quality broadsheet national newspapers is viewed as classic journalism for many people…Exposing the rich and powerful for the scum-bags they (sometimes) truly are!But what about consumer magazine journalism or gossip websites? These outlets may place a greater emphasis on entertainment rather than education. Such articles may be created simply for profit, but represent journalism in so far as article may obey traditional conventions on writing style, accuracy, contain interviews and show a degree of research by the journalist.In quick summary, academics increasingly refer not to journalism, but there being many ‘journalisms’.

329,"Here are some of the points I have observed:First of all, get enough sleep before going to the class.Try to be a good listener, because whatever you understand is always some fraction of what you listen in the class.If you have already missed some portion of a topic, open any book and try to understand them. There will be more chances that you will understand better in class. It will also help in concentrating.Try to answer questions in the class.Try not to get distracted by -Your smartphone.The boy/girl sitting next to you. You can talk to him/her later.Others doing something else than studying.Don’t think what you’re getting taught will not be of any use in future. Believe me, this is not true.Always go to the class after eating something. A cup of coffee/tea will also work. You won’t get distracted by hunger."

331,"Pros:Exceptionally loving, loyal, easy to train, and care about your feelings. I used to leave food on the table and go out for hours: my German Shepherd mix would guard it instead of eating it.Sensitive, sweet, kind and playful. At one point I had a kitten and my dog was completely besotted with him. They would roll around on the floor together for hours. The kitten would pounce on his tail and playfully claw and bite his face, and the shepherd would just snuggle up and lick him.Intelligence. They are rated by Stanley Coren as one of the top ten breeds in terms of working intelligence. From my own experience, I'd describe them as highly trainable rather than smart exactly. Very beautiful and athletic, especially the working lines. Instinctively protective and usually sensible about it. I felt safe walking alone at night with my shepherd mix, even in rough neighborhoods. The only times he showed any aggression to humans were when he sensed that I felt threatened -- in which case he could be extremely intimidating. None of my other dogs have shown such good judgement.Cons: They're somewhat nervous: because they are also loyal and protective, they need substantial socialization to ensure they won't endanger people and animals. This may be a major time sink. Some shepherds will never be trustworthy with small dogs, which means you can never let them off-leash in a public place. I knew a well-bred shepherd owned by very experienced, responsible people, who bit a stranger in her territory severely.They bark about the average amount for a dog, which is too much for many people, so you will have to train them to bark less. They also shed and stink about the average amount.Some people are really scared of them. You may have difficulty getting a lease.They are usually Velcro dogs. They don't want to be alone, and when they're awake, they really want to participate in whatever you're doing. If you have to go out a lot, or you don't want tennis balls dropped in your lap while you're watching TV every night, or you like to shower alone, don't get a shepherd.They are fairly active dogs, both mentally and physically. Just to not be miserable, they need about an hour of exercise every day, toys to chew on, and big open spaces to explore. Young dogs are too big and rough to be around young kids without frequent intervention.They have been through periods of popularity in which unscrupulous breeders produced lines with unreliable temperaments. In addition, some responsible breeders select for much more tough guard dogs, whilst others aim for a softer, more gentle animal. So finding the right breeder will be challenging. They are very prone to a wide range of health problems, more so than similar but less popular breeds. Be prepared to shell out money for hip surgery. For this reason alone, I would choose a first generation cross if possible rather than a purebred shepherd. Or you might consider a Belgian shepherd, which are very similar but have less problems.Most of these cons can't be predicted or controlled for any individual dog. There are ways to deal with them, but they're costly. German shepherds very often end up in shelters because their owners either didn't think through, or found they couldn't deal with these issues when they actually happened. This is heartbreaking for everyone involved, and most of all for the dog. You might consider adopting an older dog since shelters usually screen them carefully and will know which issues are likely to arise."
332,"First.  Some re-education.If you ask what a vehicle is to someone in the 19th century and you may have been answered with, ""a cart.""If you ask someone in the Delphi SUV going across America, you may hear them argue that they are riding in an driverless car.Definitions change.This is especially true with Deism.While people have been turned off to God, church, and religion (if I had revealed religion as my standard, I would too), some others still search to identify with a belief that they have.  They are looking for who they are as a spiritual being and sometimes they try to accomplish this surrounded by Apatheists, Agnostics, and Atheists.  This is much like trying to define your political views surrounded by Anarchists.To use a definition for Deism from the 18th century would be unfair to postmodern philosophy, so here is one new definition formed by a consensus of Deists."" Deism is belief in the existence of God  based on rational thought, without any reliance on revealed religion or  religious authority. Deism emphasizes natural revelation, that is, God's  existence is revealed in nature.""Furthermore, in the scope of Deism today, that definition is left to the person to define what they believe, but belief is crucial to the Deist.Certain Deists are close to Agnosticism as they believe, and have total comfort in believing, that the true nature of God may not or cannot be known.https://www.facebook.com/pages/T..."

The nickname for that is the “money shot"" and it seems that porn viewers expect to see this. In real life, intercourse usually (but not always) ends with ejaculation in the vagina."

335,"Figure. From ASAP Science's (link in citations) video on lacrimation.The reason that we cry, or lacrimate, is still open for debate. Theories range from crying serving as a non-verbal cue to it being part of some kind of hormone release valve mechanism.There could have been social evolutionary benefits for those who cried. Crying could have served as a signal for help or pity, or a bonding tool by which the crier is consoled and a bond is formed through that consolation. Note that these would be advantages to have in societies where the proficiency of a group's communication is key to their proliferation as a whole (e.g. a primate society like ours).Another theory to explain crying is that crying is the body's response to too much stress. This theory could possibly explain the different chemical composition of tears developed during crying, as opposed to the tears that are created for natural lubrication or in response to irritation. This theory speculates using both the aforementioned differential composition as well as the ""relief"" that is felt after a cry. The premise of this theory is that ""tearing"" up is the body's way of getting rid of the hormones that developed during stress. Tears, in this way, would be a product of our body's means of decreasing excess hormone levels.I don't know how this would account for the tears developed when happy, however. Perhaps happy tears evolved for a similar purpose to the aforementioned social advantages.It is thus likely that lacrimating evolved for multiple purposes.Citations:image and a great video from ASAP science about it - general - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryinghttp://www.npr.org/templates/sto...http://www.livescience.com/7854-..."

339,"Rather than give you the usual opinions and political diatribes, why don't we start with what I learned from researching the tobacco industry and what they know?Myth #1: Smoking is stupid and gives you nothing. You were suckered into it and now you are a big fool who is stuck with it.Myth #2: Nicotine addiction is worse than heroin.There are probably a few more myths but these are the ones that matter most because they lead you to believe that you were crazy and now trapped. It also separates the physical aspect of smoking from the mental side and explains why you need to fight the habit on two separate fronts - and not necessary at the same time. The reason most people fail to quit is because they do exactly that - they fight the mental and physical side of smoking at the same time, and it is virtually impossible to succeed. Napoleon couldn't fight Britain and Russia at the same time nor could Hitler, so take wisdom here!Granted, you will always hear stories from people who say they did just that - thereby making you look like a chump and them remarkably superior. In most cases, they weren't truly committed smokers: part-timers who really smoked to be cool. Committed smokers are engaged in a form of existential self-medication. So, if you are smoking a pack or more a day and especially, if you started on or before age 18 - listen up, this is about you, the committed smoker whose identity and life-coping skills are now deeply entwined with smoking.Answer to Myth #1: Smoking is stupid and gives you nothing.Smoking may be terrible for your physical health but it has recognized benefits for your mental health.Depressives are 3 times more likely to smoke than non-depressives. Smoking has long been used as a folk-cure for anxiety, ADD, plain boredom and so on. Nicotine has been shown to address early stage Alzheimer's, and smokers tend to be attracted to other smokers, especially those that share their brands - like fellow tribesmen. So it is also very social - especially for young people.The fact is, you smoke for a reason - or a bunch of reasons and you need to deal with them. You don't have to resolve them, most run really deep but, at the very least, you need to find a strategy to deal with theses issues which may include transferring them to some other activity, preferably sports, yoga or some other physically fulfilling pursuit. Even a little overeatin' is better than smokin'….. easier to lose weight than fix a diseased lung, as they say!Sadly, however, most people transfer to prescription drugs (watched any TV commercials lately? drugs dominate the media) but in that regard they are far from alone. According to the Centers for Disease Control, prescription drug rates have increased as a mirror image to the decline in smoking. That's right folks, 30 years ago when about 44% of the adult population smoked and 24% took stuff like Valium, Xanax, Ambien, Ridalin, Concerta (or their precursors) now only 24% of the adult population smokes and about 46% are chomping down those drugs. (Let's not forget the quit-smoking Chantix on that list, which is essentially an anti-depressant.)In other words, while no one was looking, Big Pharma took over from Big Tobacco. In fact, if you go back in time to TV 1966, you would be amazed by the number of cigarette adds. Then flip to today's primetime TV and you will see they have been replaced by prescription drug ads.If you are literate enough to read my book, Cigarette Seduction, and willing to dip into your cigarette money account to buy a copy - you will see how your brand choices reflect your underlying mental condition (we developed this from smoker surveys and a semiotic analysis of brands). You can use this to analyze your reason for smoking, the triggers and even develop strategies to transfer mentally.In other words, what you smoke is how you quit……Myth #2: Nicotine addiction is as hard to quit as heroin.Having interviewed heroin addicts, I really have to laugh at this. When you listen to former heroin addicts, they talk about their habit as if they went to paradise, met God, had lunch with Jesus and ravished all the virgins in heaven. I know of no cigarette brand that has this power. The fact is, you can quit nicotine over a bad cold. You just need about 3 days for it to leave your body - enough so your nicotine receptors can stop going crazy. If, however, you are foolish enough try to resolving the mental, self-medicating side at the same time as the physical cessation, it may certainly feel as bad as heroin (at least in your mind's eye) but I can guarantee you it's not the same. Not even close.Bottom line: take the time to understand your personal relationship with smoking, get a handle on the motivation and the triggers. You should buy a book to help you along (I mentioned one….). There's no giant rush here. I spent 4 years doing this before taking the leap and quitting for good! It also helps if you start debranding and even moving to a different delivery platform such as mini-cigars, tobacco chews (Skoal Bandits, snuff etc.) or best of all, eCigarettes.Then, when you are comfortable, and in control, you catch a really bad cold, a touch of flu' or, you just take the leap, say at a nature weekend and quit. Then, just stay away from other smokers (who will always subconsciously try to ""draw"" you back in), your usual haunts and so on, as you say good goodbye and good riddance to smoking. You start chewing baby carrots, make more love (but without the smoky ending), run, jump, play tennis, swim or otherwise keep physically busy…..and you'll get there.Most important - once you demystify smoking and replace it strategically, you will never feel the pull to smoke again. At that point it, makes no sense - smoking will seem as big a joke as ""heaven"" is to an ex-heroin addict."

341,"Earthquake Resistant Design Philosophy:The engineers do not attempt to make earthquake-proof buildings that will not get damaged even during the rare but strong earthquake; such buildings will be too robust and also too expensive. Instead, the engineering intention is to make buildings earthquake-resistant; such buildings resist the effects of ground shaking, although they may get damaged severely but would not collapse during the strong earthquake. Thus, safety of people and contents is assured in earthquake-resistant buildings, and thereby a disaster is avoided. This is a major objective of seismic design codes throughout the world. Building Twist During Earthquake:A building with identical vertical members and that are uniformly placed in the two horizontal directions, when shaken at its base in a certain direction, swings back and forth such that all points on the floor move horizontally by the same amount in the direction in which it is shaken.But in most cases are buildings are not symmetrical, Hence there will be unequal amount of swing and shake. This will cause what is known as Twist or Torsion. This unequal movement will cause more damage to columns, which move more during the shake.This twist or torsion due to unequal distribution will cause maximum failure of buildings. Design :Buildings should be designed like the ductile chain. For example, consider the common urban residential apartment construction - the multi-storey building made of reinforced concrete. It consists of horizontal and vertical members, namely beams and columns. The seismic inertia forces generated at its floor levels are transferred through the various beams and columns to the ground. The correct building components need to be made ductile. The failure of a column can affect the stability of the whole building, but the failure of a beam causes localized effect. Therefore, it is better to make beams to be the ductile weak links than columns. This method of designing RC buildings is called the strong-column weak-beam design method (Figure 4). This will make the buildings better resistant to twist. Brick Masonry Structures :In case of brick masonry , the walls lying perpendicular to the direction of ground shake will fail first. Their joints will give away and the walls collapse. Hence it is important that we eliminate this kind of seismic behavior of buildings.  This can be achieved by (a) ensuring good interlocking of the masonry courses at the junctions, and (b) employing horizontal bands at various levels, particularly at the lintel level.Framed Structures : For a building to remain safe during earthquake shaking, columns (which receive forces from beams) should be stronger than beams, and foundations which receive forces from columns) should be stronger than columns. Further, connections between beams & columns and columns & foundations should not fail so that beams can safely transfer forces to columns and columns to foundations.               When the strategy of Strong Column and Weak Beam is adopted in design, damage is likely to occur first in beams . When beams are detailed properly to have large ductility, the building as a whole can deform by large amounts despite progressive damage caused due to consequent yielding of beams. In contrast, if columns are made weaker, they suffer severe local damage, at the top and bottom of a particular storey. This localized damage can lead to collapse of a building, although columns at storeys above remain almost undamaged.  The Beam Column Joints can be strengthened using more stirrups towards the joint. How to Reduce the effect on Buildings :Conventional seismic design attempts to make buildings that do not collapse under strong earthquake shaking, but may sustain damage to non-structural elements (like glass facades) and to some structural members in the building.

342,"She isn't a bad actress. But she is more suitable to a certain genre of films. She wouldn't be convincing as a girly, bubbly, social, next door girl character with too many dialogues. She has some mannerisms like pouting, sounding incoherent, biting her lips, running her hands through her hair constantly, which many people find distracting. You may say that she's a limited actress. But you never know. Maybe if she widens her choice, we'll be able to observe better.Twilight- She's perfect as Bella. There's a reason these movies are hits. If you think Robert Pattinson's responsible for it, then you are half correct. KStew made her Bella vulnerable, desirable, awkward, beautiful, enclosed. You could feel that the vampire wasn't able to read her like he could do with the other people. And that's a great achievement. Imagine any other actress in her place, and you could tell, that maybe they are more expressive, but Bella isn't suppose to be too expressive.Speak- She hasn't got many dialogues in this. But her silent portrayal was great.The Cake Eaters - Her body language was superb in this one.The Messengers, Cold Creek Manor- Angsty teenager played nicely.The Runaways - I am not culturally aware of Joan Jett and that band. But through interviews, Joan Jett has praised KStew for effectively playing her. And she acted nicely here.On the Road- Mary Lou in the book hardly has anything substantial to do. In the film, with all that sensuality, she was able to grab eyeballs. This film, if it has made any money, is largely because of KStew. And she's got favorable reviews for it as well.Welcome to the Rileys- She was very good in her portrayal of a ""stripper"". Again a very rebellious teen character.Adventureland , Into the wild - I found her very hot in this one :PZathura, Jumpers, Catch that kid- hardly anything to do.Panic room- I was 13-14 and developed a slight crush on her :DCamp X-Ray - She's comfortable here and her acting doesn't look fakeStill Alice - miniscule role, but the ending does leave an impactClouds of Sils Maria - WOW! She's very good here."
343,"Your question is founded on two false assumptions.The notion of what is considered feminine or masculine dependents entirely on that specific culture and its own contexts. What you consider to be feminine might not be considered feminine in Japan. Therefore, you’re imposing your own culture’s gender norms on another culture, which never works. I once went on a night out with a few friends who play in the American football team for my university in Britain. When intoxicated late into the night, I saw these large, muscly men embracing one another and giving each other a peck on the cheek as an sign of friendship and camaraderie. This ‘bromance’ culture of heterosexual men hugging and kissing other heterosexual men is largely absent in Japan, and most would consider it very unusual and ‘feminine’ behaviour. I’ve also seen Italian men engaging in what I, as a Japanese, would consider to be an ‘excessive’ outpour of romantic emotion towards their partners, something that would also be considered abnormally ‘unmanly’ in Japan where men are often expected to refrain from displaying their emotion. Gender norms are social constructs and relative to that culture.Japanese men don’t actively try to look more ‘feminine’. What they do to make themselves look like they do are either gendered to be masculine or not gendered at all. Another reason why many in the West might think that Japanese men look feminine is because Japanese men, by in large, are shorter, skinnier, and younger-looking than men of other racial backgrounds. For most Japanese women, it’s generally considered unattractive if you look old and scruffy, too bulky, and especially too overweight. Grooming (shaving, plugging eyebrows, using hair products, even wearing makeup for some) and dressing fashionably are considered essential social practices in Japan, especially in the big cities.One reason why Japanese men are seen to be more ‘feminine’ is because much of the Western attention on the country focuses on what’s going on in Tokyo. And in Tokyo, you might see many men who fit into the ‘metrosexual’ category, which also exist quite abundantly in other major world cities like Paris, London, and New York; well-dressed, well-groomed, and often in good shape. If you leave Tokyo and head to the provinces, there are more men who would be considered ‘chavs’, ‘douchebags’, ‘lads’, and ‘bros’ who often display testosterone-driven aggression, barely make any effort to look presentable, are open about their misogynistic views, and like to start fights with strangers, fitting more into what you might consider to be ‘masculine’."

That business requires at least internet, camera laptops/PC , requires qualified candidate.And you may end up with losses.In my case you can start your business with only Rs.100.When I was in college I was able to pay my college fee from my business, my college fee was 1 lakh per year.I started my business 4 year agoWhen I was student I had seen many students looking for accommodation .I thought I can make money from it.I decided that time I will.I went to down town roamed around, I found one family they are looking for paying guestI started discussion with family I had collected all information regarding fees,water supply electric supply, advance amount.On next day I woke up early morning taken my laptop and started designing advertisement of that roomIn that advertisement, I had mentioned all facilities, fees and location of room.I went to Xerox shop to take printout.I pinned that printout advertisement on college notice board and mentioned my number.Within two days I received 50–60 calls.I made a list of all buyers.(approx.55)I told them about that room and my fees 500 per person.I also told the landlord about my fees - 500 per person.I showed that room to 4 guys, and one of them was ready to move into that room.So I made my 1st deal on that day.So now I have Rs.1000 in my pocket and have 54 tenant contacts, so thought this is a potential goldmine.I appointed a local boy who was not very literate and didn't belong to my college.I told him to search for rental house in city and to give me details and contacts and I would give him Rs.50 rupees per house.This time I was left with 40 potential buyers.I successfully made all 40 deals.I got 40×1000=40,000(+)Local boy reward 40×50=2,000(-)My initial investment was = 500(-)So I made total = 37,500This all happened in one month.Now I appointed two local boysOne to post advertisements in crowded areasAnd one for finding out the rooms.So I made around 12 lakhs in my academic years excluding local boys payout and investment.Now this time I bought a car of 5lakh and attached it to company for transportation.I charge around 15,000/- per month.So my monthly income is 15000+35,000= 50,000.(including local boy payout , investment, car maintenance)Annual income is 6lakh rupees without jobNow I am working with MNC as engineer my salary is 8 lakhs per annumSo my total annual income is 14 lakh per year.My work load is to handle local boys and to maintain the car.My Future plan is to open security agency services, man power supply, school buses etc. Soon I will make income beyond 25 lakhs per annum.

349,"Thanks for the ask to answer.For me it depends entirely on where you live and what activities your dog participates in as well.Spot on applications consist of a liquid that you place on the skin on the back of the neck. These as great as they are easy to do and are given monthly. However,if you wash your dog frequently or your dog goes swimming these applications will wear off faster. If you have children there is always the risk they will be exposed to the liquid.Oral tablets such as comfortis (name of product in Australia) are great as it not only kills fleas on your dog within 30 minutes of ingestion but it also prevents fleas from being able to live on your dog. There is almost no risk that children will have access to it unless your dog spits it out or vomits the tablet back up."
350,"J was originally distinguished from the letter I at some point during the mid-1500s by a Frenchman named Pierre Ramus. The J character had existed for a while before, but was used for other purposes, not in english. The letter J originally made the ""y"" sound, but at around the same time that the letter J was introduced, many of the Western European languages made a sound shift, and began pronouncing the vowel ""y"" like the consonant  ""dʒ"" or what we now commonly use the letter J for. The older vowel use is still seen in a few European languages, German and Norwegian for example."
351,"Shop for (up to) four weeks, not one.It's hard to tell much about a class from the first week alone --- you typically only get two lectures to try out, and the first one is often an overview that doesn't give you a good sense of how the rest of the course will actually be run.  But the add/drop deadline is the fifth Monday of the semester (with $10 fee, or third Monday with no fee).If you're still deciding between two classes on study card day, put both on your study card.  Try out the first few weeks of both courses, then whenever you're confident you know which course you prefer, drop the extra class.There are many advantages to this approach:  You get to try out the first few problem sets (if your course has them), see how your professor lectures when it isn't shopping week, and meet the TF and other students in your section, not to mention having a better sense of whether you enjoy the material in the course and whether the level of difficulty will be appropriate for you.Sometimes even the first 3-5 weeks of a course aren't representative (CS 121, for which I was a teaching fellow, picks up quite a bit after the fifth Monday), so it's worth asking your professors what to expect.  The other main drawback is that you have to some extra work for a course you end up dropping, but the beginning of the semester isn't usually so busy anyway, and I've found I've chosen courses more wisely with 3 weeks of information rather than 1."

The ending lines in the closure of the novel which are the final thoughts of a man who sacrifices himself for the woman he loves is still etched in my heart ““It is a far, far better thing that I do, than I have ever done; it is a far, far better rest that I go to"" I think it’s one of the first novels that made me cry inconsolable tears. )5.Oliver Twist( This book did not fail to make me shed a few tears over the way poor little orphaned Oliver was treated by some cruel people who were supposed to take care of him. And when Dick says his farewell to Oliver! That was the first occasion on which Oliver had ever encountered kindness. Thank God for the happy ending for Oliver though-Dick dies)6.Great expectations(another masterpiece of Dickens’)7.David Copperfield(This book has one of the best female characters in all books I’ve read-Agnes. Lovely, kind, intelligent she’s loved David all her life and finally a tad thickheaded as he is, David realizes the fact and they get together.)George Elliot:(one of the best writers in English!)8.Middlemarch(One of the best books I’ve read with so many interesting characters in it.Dorothea, Will, Lydgate and Mary were my favorites. Beautiful written prose, insights into each character and their thought process, the problems they encounter and their reaction to it, kept me hooked to the end. A book that shows that even intelligent women in those times found it difficult to carry out an action they knew to be right without a man's approval and that how often what we perceive of others is so wrong!)9.Mill on the Floss(Another favorite of mine, even more beautifully written than Middlemarch if that’s possible and one that I connected with more than any other because it has sibling love in it.)Jane Austen10.Pride and Prejudice(Another favorite female character of all novels I’ve read-Elizabeth Bennett. Enough said!)11.Sense and sensibility12.Emma(A woman that is a shining example to her gender)13.Persuasion(Best novel of Jane Austens’ in my opinion and a must read!)14.Mansfield ParkRobert Louis Stevenson:15.Kidnapped (Best novel by this author. One couldn’t help sympathizing with David-the Hero in the book and I read the book hastily to see what destiny awaited him after he was arranged to be kidnapped by his own uncle to deprive him of his rightful property.

355,"It depends on what aspect of psychology you're looking into. Clinical Psychology is research and theory--playing with furry mice and then dissecting them, for example. I don't know much about the money in the research part of psych except that it can be very cut throat and if you are interested in studying something esoteric, it can be nearly impossible to get funded. OTOH, some research gets tons of funding. If you are interested in the people/counseling/teaching side of psych, then you can teach, probably on the community college level. You could probably find any number of jobs in the non-profit social service world: Case Manager for housing programs or mental health programs, for example. Depending on what you did as an undergraduate and what state you live in, you might be able to find employment in a school district, a Head Start Program, an addiction treatment center or working with domestic violence perpetrators or victims, or in prisons or with troubled youth. Different states demand different levels of extra training, usually certificates.If you are a creative thinking entrepeneur-type, you might be able to channel your Masters into something unusual, such as writing books or curriculum. The likelihood that  you will make a lot of money is slim. Unless you lucked out and landed a job with a university extension doing something in academia, you might never earn more than 47k a year.

358,"All these first world problems are making me think of some third world problems:After a hard day's work in front of my laptop, I lie down on my bed and realize that the maid who made the bed before she left for the day kept the remote controls on the nightstand to the left of the bed, instead of the right side of the bed where I sleep. Which means that I'll have to stretch all the way across the bed to get the remotes. Sometimes, she even puts them on the TV stand, which means I have to get out of bed to get the remote!I have a meeting at 10:30am at a place 30 minutes away from my home (a.k.a. 5 miles), and the driver (chauffeur) comes at 10am, which means he will not have enough time to clean the car before we leave. I'll have to go in a dirty car (overnight accumulation of dust)My driver's cellphone is the same model as my cellphone - oh the horror!There's a power cut and the fan makes a slight grunting/grating sound when it is running on the inverter backup (geeks, that's because of the non-sinusoidal wave), which is very irritating, especially if it is going to keep making that noise all day.Someone in the cook's house died, so she's taking the day off. Which means that I have to cook. Which means that the kids get to eat instant noodles again, which is very unhealthy.The American economy is tanking, which means that the dollar is weak, and the resultant exchange rate fluctuation could result in 5% less money for me on the next payment from the US. But that's not all bad, because outsourcing is also likely to increase.The stupid revolution causing my Egypt vacation to be postponed indefinitely. (I guess this is a first world problem too.)Talking of ruined vacations, I can no longer go to Goa for New Year's because of all the Americans and Europeans landing up there and driving up the prices.My doctor has raised his per visit consultation fee to $3. What does he think - I'm made of money?! The psychiatrist is even worse at $10.There are 10 restaurants here which serve Mexican food, but none of them have that authentic taste (by which I mean Mexican food in the US - you know, Chilis, Taco Bell, ... I don't even know if Mexicans in Mexico eat Mexican food. I can tell you from personal experience that the pizza in Italy is nowhere near the real thing.)It's pathetic that not all movies are released here on the same day as their US release. In this day and age! And if you think that I enjoy downloading the torrentz via my third-world broadband, you're very mistaken. Waiting 2 days for a download to complete is something I'm going to stop doing as soon as they start releasing all the movies here on the same day as the US release. (And when the movie theatres here stop catering to the masses, so that I can enjoy the movie in peace without having to tolerate all these natives...)Thanks for the question. Writing this answer has been an experience of self-realization for me. The third world has indeed caught up with the developed world, and we can be just as miserable here as you guys over there. The world is indeed flat.(All the above bullet points don't apply to me. They're all friends and friends-of-friends. Not me. Honest.)"
359,"What!? There’s no such thing as being ‘too little’ or ‘too much’ racist. Racism is racism, and even a little bit of it is potentially damaging.And that’s not the same thing as having a preference for a particular thing. For instance, let’s say for the sake of argument that as an African-American I tend to more more comfortable around other African-Americans.That’s perfectly okay, though that doesn’t mean that I can’t have friends of different colors, beliefs or whatever.But let’s take my thought exercise a little further. Let’s say that I am uncomfortable around white people.Why am I uncomfortable? What about them bothers me in particular? I understand that the history of people of African decent and whites in this country is fraught with potential minefields, but that doesn’t mean that every white person bears any animus towards me or other African-Americans.Now, I may get to know a white person and find their behavior in some instances offensive, but that doesn’t meany ALL white people feels the same way.In other words, it’s complex though understanding starts when we not only stop pretending that we’re fine with certain differences in people, though healing starts when we see those differences, and ask ourselves why it is that we feel a particular way about them.Here’s another example. What I have come to notice is that some white people are very uneasy around black people. They cross the street when you approach, and often will pretend not to see you when you’re literally standing right in front of them.Based on what I can see, their feeling is entirely without logic because they don’t know me, and I have never hurt anyone (outside of being in a fight or two when I was younger) so they have a problem, but their problem literally has nothing to do with me, and everything to do with the baggage they’re carrying around in their own heads.Let’s take another hypothetical. Suppose you were a white person, and were mugged by some black youths. You might, understandably so, be somewhat uneasy among black youths.And if you hang on to that fear–which is what it is–then it poisons everything you see and do, which is a bit tragic."

364,"Thanks a lot for A2A Arun!If you just search for public speaking on Google, you can get plenty of resources featuring it but since still that question persists then you might be seeking personal experiences which I would try to be deliver honestly. TL;DRPublic speaking is an art of persuading people- well that's what the gist of its definitions says and that should be your aim too. Its a skill which needs to be mastered- important to be acquired but at the same time to be controlled abiding by implicit protocols. After entering the college, I felt there are plenty of occasions where you need to leave behind your hesitation - whether its asking questions from certain dignitary in any seminar or presenting your ideas before the audience- the basic thing is to overcome your fear and speak up while many non-familiar people are around.I've mentioned certain factors which would help you in enhancing your public speaking ability as they've helped me a lot-Reading - Read as much as you can- books, novels, magazines, newspapers, articles anything. More you read, more you would get to know things. You may not remember much of what you read but that's OK after all its human nature to forget which is essential too! - its psychological effect on person is equally important as its substantially adding to your knowledge. If you get involved in a conversation with an individual or speaking in an auditorium packed with people, its important that you have the sufficient knowledge of what you're speaking about along with how firmly you stays with yourself.Be honest - Who could be the better public speakers than the stand up comedians or witty celebrities?- they apart from conveying what have to say, also ensure that it reaches the audience effectively. One major factor in their proper execution is honesty. They speak whatever they have to say without bothering much about it and they're prompt too. They believe whatever they've prepared is product of careful observation, humor and wit and they're honest to their work. Personally I feel Jennifer Lawrence is a very good example of it (she is not stand up comedian officially but surely a good public speaker). Whatever she says is quite honest and that's why people admire her.Don't underestimate yourself and don't overestimate public as well- I don't think it requires much illustration. Most of the people fear about being the subject of laughter if the things didn't go well and that's where the confidence dies. Accept the fact that there will be many knowledgeable people there or you might go wrong somewhere but that doesn't matter, atleast you did what you were supposed to. Moreover, genuine people will always support you instead of laughing on your mistakes, its those people who can't do that themselves will laugh. No one cares and so should you- keep this in your mind in such situation.Aesthetics- Sometimes besides obvious factors, somethings might assist them as well but there effect might not be that conspicuous like do exercise, keep yourself healthy, do meditation for your inner peace, enhance your body language, etc. Be nice to people and never boast about yourself - it would help in bringing up a positive image of yours in people and that will certainly be a mental boost for you.Confidence- This one governs all of factors that I had mentioned and what I would mention in the following context. Have confidence in yourself that you can do it. People expect something from you when you're speaking before them and your confidence would reflect your leadership quality and determine how effectively you persuade them. The points mentioned above would certainly help you in being a public speaker but what ensures that you're good too? Reading along might help :) -Have a smile on your face while you speak. I don't how people react to it but as far as I've experience, if you have a nice smile on your face then beside making you look more confident it also psychologically urge people to have a sense of authenticity in your talk.Practice regularly and be consistent. For mastering anything you need practicing it because one doesn't simply become good at it. Talk to your friends, then small bunch of people, take part in competitions or join the clubs. Do whatever is feasible and put your effort.Don't be monotonous or dominating. Many a time, you need to listen patiently rather than making it monologue. Understand that the other people too have a share- while you speak in public, make the people feel comfortable in asking questions to you as well. Though the scenario might not be same always but it exits.Look in the audiences' eyes while you speak. Even if you have to read out some script or speak some mugged up speech, making eye contact will surely add up in making you a good speaker. Initially you may get nervous but as said earlier that's how you get better at it.Don't utter anything irrelevant or offensive. Don't try to make others fool by saying anything that may seem funny to you but has no relevance to what you're supposed to speak about. Come up with relevant examples or share your personal experiences. Keep in mind that a good speaker is the one which can interest people with his/her words so that they're bound to listen.There are plenty of apt people who would be suitable for answering your question, I just tried to share whatever I realized myself so far. Hope it helps :)Image sources- Peter Dhu & Kameron Hurley respectively."

366,"As strange as it is to say, probably Trump.Let's start with the disclaimer that both of them are likely to be in a world of hurt when they reach the general election -- both are massively unlikeable in their own ways. But Trump's appeal, such as it is, does have some ability to cut across party lines whereas Cruz is ONLY going to appeal to the portion of the Republican base that doesn't hate his guts. Republicans will hold their noses and vote for Trump, and he might pick up some Democrats and independents who like his brand of bombast; even if everyone holds their nose and votes for Cruz, it's hard to imagine any Democrats and independents doing so.Honestly, if there's a Republican that scares me this time around, it's Rubio. His positions are pretty much just as bad as Cruz or Trump, but he's managed to avoid swimming in the cesspool with them."
367,"The name of a bastard really depends on their parentage. Samarth is correct by saying that it depends on the region they are from but let's look at Jon as an example.  He was born in the south and brought north by Ned after Robert's Rebellion so I think it's more correct to say that it is based on their parentage than on their region of birth.Another example of this is Obara Sand. Daughter of Oberyn Martell, she was born in Oldtown to a whore. So being from the Reach as far as anyone knew, she should have been named Flowers but when her father came to claim her she went with him and went with the name Sand.  No idea whether she used Sand from birth or took it up after meeting Oberyn but the fact is that she was born in the Reach and used the name Sand anyway since she had been acknowledged by her father."
368,"Bermuda Triangle is the greatest unsolved mystery of the modern age. Also called Devil's Triangle. It is a triangular shaped area in the North Atlantic Ocean, from Bermuda Island to Miami, USA and Puerto Rico. Hundreds of people and numerous boats, ships and planes have disappeared inside this triangle. Reasons given for these disappearances vary from scientific to sheer myth. Here are 10 facts about Bermuda Triangle :Fact No. 1The Bermuda Triangle is not small. In fact, it is quite large and covers an area of 440,000 miles of sea. This is larger than the combined area of Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh & Maharashtra.Fact No. 2The bermuda triangle is certainly not fixed and its effect can be experienced outside of the triangle too.Fact No. 3The disappearances are ascribed to UFO's and alien activity, city of Atlantis lost under the triangle, and various other technical, natural and geographical reasons.Fact No. 4Whenever any plane or ship disappears in the Triangle, its debris cannot be found. The reason behind this is that Gulf Stream runs near the triangle, which quickly gets rid of the debris.Fact No. 5At least 1000 lives are lost within the last 100 years. On average, 4 aircraft and 20 yachts go missing every year.Fact No. 6Inside the Bermuda Triangle, US Government has AUTEC (for Atlantic Undersea Test and Evaluation Center), which is located on the Andros Island of Bahamas. Here US Navy tests their submarines, sonar and other weapons. However many are of the view that it is more than just the testing center.Fact No. 7People have experienced electronic fog in bermuda triangle, which can be a Time Travel Tunnel too. Pilot Bruce Gernon claims he lost 28 minutes after flying through a time-warping cloud tunnel. The plane went missing from radars, only to re-emerge in Miami Beach. (Source: The Fog by Bruce Gernon.)Fact No. 8One of the biggest and famous losses of US Military occurred in 1945. Five US Navy Avenger torpedo bombers flew from Fort Lauderdale, Florida for a sortie to the island of Bimini. The mission had 14 men. After about 90 minutes, the radio operators received a signal that the compass was not working. After that the communication was lost. The bombers were never found. The three planes that went for their rescue also disappeared.Fact No. 9The first person to report about Bermuda Triangle was Christopher Columbus. He wrote in his journals that inside the triangle, the ship's compass stopped working and he also saw a fireball in the sky.Fact No. 10Bermuda Triangle is one of the rare places on earth where the compass does not point towards Magnetic North. Instead of that, it point towards true north, which creates confusion and that's why so many ships and planes lost its course in the triangle"

372,"A primer on your height & what you can do about itYour height is determined between 60%-85% by your genetics. The remainder of that is environmental, primarily nutrition[1]. If you're malnourished during your growing years you won't reach your full potential. If you get enough nutrition you'll likely reach your genetically predetermined height, possibly a little taller.There is some indications that getting enough protein through your developmental years can add to your height positively. In Japan after the war, the population had access to more fish protein and the average height of the country increased 3 inches[2]. Denmark has become one of the tallest countries in the world, and it's rise in height is strongly correlated to it's wealth per capita .[3] The most likely take away here is that people that can afford to eat, and eat well, will be taller over generations. It’s easy to make this connection between these two long term correlations. Nutrition can slowly cause an increase in height between generations. It's no guarantee that you'll be taller through eating, but proper nutrition through your formative years, can add a bit onto your genetics. A good, balanced diet of fats, proteins, and carbohydrates -- eat food, not too much, mostly plants -- you'll do fine.They've been doing some research on fraternal twins to try to determine what the specific gene is that determines height. The reason that they're looking at fraternal twins rather than identical twins is that their exact DNA is different but most of the environmental factors are the same (what the mother ate while they were pregnant, probably how they were treated after they were born, etc). They can then compare the genomes of the twins after they reach their height and see what is different between them. They do this for thousands of fraternal twin pairs to determine which parts of their genomes are different. As of writing this they think it's partly in the X chromosome and chromosomes 7, 8, and 20. Scientists haven't narrowed it down entirely, genes are pretty complex and it's not as simple as it's explained in your general science classes with recessive genes and dominant genes.[4]As you grow up, your bones get longer. Everyone has Epiphyseal plates at the ends of their bones. As you grow, these plates are added onto. When you go through growth spurts, particularly puberty, they are added onto rather quickly. Some people experience growing pains in their bones as they expand. When you're done growing (mostly by the time you're 18-25), your bones Ossify, the epiphyseal plates seal themselves, and you stop growing taller and longer. At that point you're done. No more growing. That's it.How do I know if my Epiphyseal plates have sealed?I’m going to quote this answer: Thomas Johnson's answer to How do you know when your epiphyseal plates are sealed (disregarding age)? (Please go and up vote his answer if you find this portion illuminating)When looking at an x-ray of your limbs, look for the line between the diaphysis (shaft of the long bone) and epiphysis (rounded articulation/ where the joint lies). Here is a picture of the epiphyseal plates of the distal tibia and fibula in an ankle:You can easily see the dark line above both ""ankles"" or malleoli. These are the epiphyseal plates you are looking for. Here is a picture when the ""growth plates"" are ""sealed"":You can see the white line on both sides of the knee, known as an epiphyseal scar. The white line means the area is more dense, whereas the dark line from before means it is the less dense, growing cartilaginous tissue. If the white line exists, it means the epiphyseal plate has ""closed"" and no additional bone will grow from the cartilage.Daily fluctuationsYour height actually decreases slightly through the day. In between your spinal disc s there are fluid sacs. When you stand up your head and shoulders put a..."

374,"I make yogurt much of the time utilizing 2% drain and the whey dependably isolates a bit. Indeed, even locally acquired yogurt does this. (However, maybe I'm not understanding your question.)We generally strain the yogurt in a colander fixed with material (i.e., cheesecloth) over a bowl to permit a great part of the whey to deplete out. This is on the grounds that we like the yogurt to be thicker. This is significantly more work, in any case, in the event that you favor less whey then you could attempt this strategy.

The quality of education remains same throughout Germany. The education system, the style of education and other things remain same.

379,"Massaging your temples or another's temples to soothe a headache can help with the pain in several different ways: distraction from the pain and also maximization of circulation and optimal myofascial (muscle/connective tissue) function.   This answer is mainly directed toward someone with a headache in the temple region, outside of the eyes.  The answer may be different for someone with a headache in a different region of the head.  When you massage the temples, you can do several techniques: mainly friction (rubbing across the skin) or various methods of kneading (rubbing into the skin and underlying tissues).  Friction mainly is for draining pain-inducing chemicals from the tissues, to be resupplied with fresh blood supply, which essentially ""cleanses"" the tissue of pain and result in inflammation.  Kneading (like the circle patterns we usually do) is to break up areas of myofascial tension and adhesion to underlying structures via repeated tension cycles. This will be for several goals: to break apart connective tissue that is cutting off blood/lymph/nerve supply and also to stimulate and reset optimal fluid flow in the tissue.   Now, if you apply constant pressure to trigger points in the temporalis muscle, you will get relief from tension in the following areas (of red/referred pain):The tricky part is that these areas can be referred and triggered from other areas, which is a whole other question.  But, it does feel good to release these points if you have a tension headache.  If one has a true migraine, they may release part of the tension headache component with this, but the true migraine is unfortunately a different beast. It requires much more complete and systemic measures to address."
380,"I DO NOT regret joining MIT, Manipal.Before coming to Manipal, after going through all the admission processes of various colleges, I finally got into SRM, Chennai (kattankulathur) with Mechanical (which I wanted) and I was satisfied and happy about. I didn't want to apply or appear for any other college after finally securing a good seat. And then I received my MIT's counselling dates. My mother and my aunt (who did her MBBS from KMC, Manipal) convinced me to just visit the place once for counselling. I finally agreed as I already had paid for SRM, so no harm in just visiting Manipal. When we (me and my mother) landed in Mangalore, the airport, long drive to Manipal and the rains were a big turn-off for me. My mother was very optimistic about the place. We didn't book the rooms in good hotels before coming, so we finally got a room at Hotel Ashlesh (for the price of one room in Fortune Inn Valley View). Another big turn-off. Next day, we went to the campus and got into the campus tour bus. After seeing Marena, Audio-visual theatre, Edu Building, the campus, facilities, hostels, medical insurance facilities for students, international hostels, etc., I just wanted to cancel my SRM allotment and come and join Manipal (even if I were I getting Biomedical Engineering). So, that's how I got into Manipal.After a year of failing 9 out of 12 subjects and getting a year-back, I questioned my decision of joining Manipal and whether I was really interested in the field of Engineering or just joined the Bandwagon. The next six months I was at home, thinking about my past and future, and concluded that I was more into Business Management than Engineering, and that I joined the Bandwagon and was trying to become just another engineer. As I couldn't get any admission in any college in the mid of the year, I decided to finish what I started (pass all the subjects which I failed) and then start applying for Business colleges. I re-registered for 8 subjects and cleared all in that one semester with a rise in GPA from 2.14 GPA to 7.4 GPA. During that period, one of the professors and mentor (Prof. Dashrathraj K Shetty) offered me a project if I were to stay back during vacations. I stayed back for those two months, published a few research papers in the field of Management after completing the project, during those holidays. I joined other senior professors along with my mentor for an international conference for Business Management and got the best paper award among all the other researchers. I later, went on to represent MIT for the Social Entrepreneurship Conclave organised by Fourth Ambit and the Government of Karnataka where we won the third prize. I joined Lions Clubs of Manipal University and became the president after a year. So, being in an engineering college, I learnt management and entrepreneurship, something that I always wanted to do.So, I don't regret any part of being an MITian. Next year, this time, I'll get a degree in B. Tech. with a lot of experience in Business Management. MIT always provides you with opportunities. It's on you, how you utilise them. And if you start regretting your decisions, you will never learn from that phase of life. Instead, start enjoying every moment, no matter what your circumstances are. Be determined and tackle your hurdles with ease, cause the hurdles are going to get bigger at every stage, only thing that can change is your ability to deal with them.Things are always going to get better. How worse can they be?My LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/name..."
381,"We were sitting in KFC’s small outlet. (We had no choice.)Both hungry after 8 hours of jee-mains lectures which hammered our every last desire to live.I ordered a regular sized paneer zinger burger & fries. He ordered some tender juicy chicken wings.I brought in our orders. The AC was too rough which made the urge to pee greater than the urge to hog in food.But when I returned, half my fries were missing along with a huge bite of my burger. I felt a current of anguish and pain running through my spine. The only person I trusted, the only person who knew I’m vegetarian & would not even taste his stuff, betrayed me & was now devouring on his chicken, half immersed in that bucket!I knew this was the end of friendship. I knew something greater than bro-code, the pen-ultimate Joey code was broken.I never trusted that guy again, I never left my fries under his watch again!If you were expecting a story of friendship seeing an end because one of them got a girl, that’s pretty much normal for me these days.Image source: Pinterest."

386,"Yes, during early pregnancy it’s extremely normal.Pinkish discharge is implantation bleeding. It happens when a fertilised egg attaches itself to the uterus and starts growing.Around 1/3rd women experience this.If the pinkish discharge is accompanied by brownish colour then it’s probably any old blood coming out of your uterus to make room for the baby and the amniotic sac.Worry when:The discharge is bright red in color.Discharge is actually bleeding and not spotting.Discharge lasts for more than 2 days.If you experience sever cramping which also lasts for more than 2 days. Normal cramping is okay and it’s called implantation cramping. But abdominal pain which is so worse that it interferes with your day to day work for more than 1–2 days is not normal."
387,"First & foremost you need to check this links  http://www.tnlounge.com/1180/how...http://www.tnlounge.com/sexualityQuick Note: Make sure to trim and file your fingernails, and wash your hands beforehand to prevent any injury or infection.You're going to be probing inside your body, so you want to use proper hygiene.Step 1: Relax and Start With Your Nipples Begin by taking a warm shower or bubble bath to relax, empty your bladder, and make sure you have some uninterrupted privacy time. Gently caress your breasts and focus on your nipples. Try stroking or pinching them until they begin to get hard and erect. If your breasts are large enough, you might try to lick the nipples yourself. Fondling your breasts is a great way to get in the mood for self-gratification.Step 2: Include Your Vagina While continuing to caress your breasts with one hand, use your other hand to tease your body and begin to explore your vagina. Gently run your hand along the parts of your body that are more sensitive to touch than others, such as your belly button, before reaching your vagina. Eventually you'll want to focus on your cl*tor*s by sliding back the hood. Try rubbing or stroking it using two fingers to expose the clit, while keeping your other hand busy with your breasts.Step 3: Finger Yourself As the excitement begins to well up, your breathing may become shorter and shallower. Remember to keep breathing while continuing to caress your breasts, and stroke your cl*t until your arousal fluids begin to flow. When you are ready, move your finger(s) into your vagina simulating intercourse. Experiment by learning how to finger yourself using the hook method by shaping your finger(s) into the shape of a ""C"" when sliding them in and out, and remember to continue rubbing your cl*t with the palm of your hand. This will accomplish what only a hand and finger(s) can do, and that is stimulating both your cl*t and your G-spot at the same time.Step 4: Stimulate Your G-Spot You can locate your G-spot two to three inches inside the top wall of your vagina. You'll know you have got it when you feel a small cluster of skin with the texture of walnut. A lot of girls can achieve an orgasm by stimulating the G-spot. Gently rubbing the G-spot leads to a vaginal orgasm that is much deeper and stronger than a clitoral orgasm and the good news is you can have multiple orgasms in the same session.Step 5: Try Different PositionsYou can finger yourself in a number of other positions besides the missionary position.From behind: Try fingering yourself from behind while laying on your back by reaching around your lower back, over your anus, and inserting your finger(s) into your vagina. The disadvantage is that this position makes it difficult to stimulate the G-spot; however, the advantage is that you can stimulate your an*s with the palm of your hand at the same time.Sitting: There are several ways to learn how to finger yourself while in a sitting position. Try using the headboard on your bed to support your back, or the top of a dresser with your back against the wall. The advantage of fingering yourself in this way is it allows for deeper penetration with your finger(s).Standing: You can also finger yourself standing up. Try using a chair to prop up one foot and have at it. The wonderful thing about masturbating while standing is that you have the best of both worlds, the option of front or rear entry. Just make sure you have something to hold on to when you reach a climax. If you really want to get a little bolder, try watching yourself in the mirror while masturbating.Doggy: Although a bit more primitive, going doggy style is just another way to enjoy self-gratification. Just get on your knees, throw your 6utt in the air, and with your head down reach around and let your finger(s) create the magic. Try it, you may like it.NOTE It is very important that you have an appreciation of your own body and how to finger yourself. Besides, it only stands to reason that the more you masturbate and become comfortable being sexual with your own body, the more you'll want to be sexual with your partner. Self-gratification is going to stimulate the part of the brain that is going to keep your libido alive, it's extremely sensual, and you will be so turned on that you might just kiss your social life goodbye for a short while.Read more about sextalk at http://www.tnlounge.com/1180/how..."
388,"The process is actually ridiculously simple. Scientists perform science the same way a child learns to open a tap. They try one thing, with a result in mind (e.g. turning a tap will result in it releasing water). If it happens, great - they then try to explain why this is the case (e.g. water pressure from below ground drives water up and through the tap when it is opened). If it doesn’t happen, they try to explain why that happened (e.g. I turned the tap the wrong way, the opening of the tap remained closed, and therefore no water was able to escape), and then try another method (e.g. turning the tap the other way).It’s literally just trial and error. It’s so simple that there’s even some evidence that animals can do this. The reason why scientists still have jobs is because the problems they tackle are usually much more complex (e.g. there are millions of factors that influence whether a person develops cancer) and require much more complicated methods to try and test than just turning a tap on and off. However the principle always remains the same."

390,"I had both of them.I come from a family with a Chinese culture and I married a women who comes from a western culture. We had 2 weddings (Chinese and western wedding) to respect both families’ culture. Given that both of our families, relatives and friends live a thousand miles away, we had to plan 2 weddings so no one is left out. I originally didn't want to have 2 weddings but my mom insisted to have a Chinese wedding as well, but our Chinese wedding was designed to be a bit more modern, and not to look like a stereotypical Chinese wedding with red colours painted across all rooms. Though, red colours still dominate the event.The experience was quite different. In fact, the whole philosophy of both weddings felt very different.I'll start off with my experience with the Chinese wedding.The Chinese wedding is more of a big celebration party. This is an event for everyone, not just you and your partner. And this good news is to be shared to as many people as your family knows, yes, your family knows, so you might see a lot of faces you don't know because they are your parents’ coworkers or friends. It's rude for your parents to not invite,say, business partner to his son’s wedding, because if you don't invite your dad’s business partner, and they found out about the wedding, it might just put the business relationship in jeopardy. Chinese wedding attendees could go up to hundreds. My wedding only had a modest 750 guests. I also felt like that it's a big announcement event for my parents to tell people that their son/daughter is now married, and that's an achievement. for them. Because it's a success if your parents could have offsprings who are married.I got the impression that the wedding is designed to be this big because we're only expected to marry once, because it's still very much taboo to get a divorce in Chinese culture. There's also a lot of symbolic customs and traditions I had to go through, like the tea ceremony, cutting ribbon, giving a red envelope, balloon release, or bowing down to in-laws.At Chinese weddings, guests are expected to give red envelope containing money for the groom and bride’s family. Some Chinese weddings even designed their wedding to get a great ROI, they would spend a ton of money to create a great party for their wedding but the amount of money they get from guests in red envelopes sometimes is higher, thus making it very profitable event.Chinese weddings are just bigger and more glamorous. Like a Chinese New Year on steroids.Tea ceremony at my weddingGlamorous decorations and faces I didn't recogniseNow, onto western wedding.It's a wedding that requires a lot of effort because everything is DIY, especially in the UK anyway. You can pretty much do whatever the hell you want with your wedding and you invite whoever you want to invite to your wedding, because hey, it's your wedding.But we opted in for a normal traditional English wedding in a church. Even though it was held in a church it was not necessarily for a religious intent.Western weddings are much smaller in size. We only had a 75–80 guests. I knew most of the people I saw at our wedding. People will go out their way to help your wedding, especially the bridesmaids and groomsman because this is your day, it's all about the couple and everyone is going to make sure that you feel special on your wedding day.Based on my experience, the food is usually pay per head instead of buffet and a lot of weddings will require an accommodation for the guests to stay overnight since there will be dancing and drinking all night. There are more venue options for western weddings, either indoor or outdoor, church or no church, so on and so forth. The budget can be low or high, and generally even the higher end is still lower than Chinese wedding budget.Western wedding is a celebration with close friends and family.At churchThe thing in common between two weddings is that both are a day to remember. Both events celebrate marriage in its own way."
391,Pakistan and India may be the only countries who have been blessed with all kind of weathers and landscape simultaneously. India as usual has upper hand here too. Yearly thousands of tourists visits India but on the other side Pakistani government and tourism department failed to attract the tourists from all over the world. This even became more worse with ongoing bad security situation in Pakistan.Pakistan has beautiful land and natural beauty is one of the blessings of Allah we have. But we also have the most dumbest people working in our departments who can't make good policies. Bottom line is Pakistan's tourism industry is going through a bad phase but situation is becoming better now. 
392,"This is pretty easy. Outsourcing is passing of some part of the work or even complete project to the external third party organization, while offshoring is just an outsourcing but to the remote country.So, offshoring is a kind of outsourcing with the notion of the distance between the client and the contractor organization. In general, there are three types of outsourcing according to the physical distance between two parties.Onshore - outsourcing of some of the business process to the contractor located in the same country with the client.Nearshore - it is an outsourcing to a neighboring country or not to a very distant location or within the same region with the time difference not more than two hours. For example, when organization located in England passes some work to the third party contractor located in France it’s a nearshore outsourcing.Offshore - it’s and outsourcing to the very distant location with the significant difference in time and all the related pros and cons of such choice like lower price and culture difference. A very standard example is an outsourcing from US to India.Also, I think that you might be interested in reading following articles to better understand outsourcing and offshore outsourcing in particular.Offshore Outsourcing: 3 Examples of Successful It OutsourcingIt’s three good examples of companies like General Electric and IKEA who have outsourced their IT to the offshore locations and its turned into a major success.How to Manage Dedicated Software Development TeamThis is the article about best practices in the management of the remote teams including offshore teams.

He always did romance.And in so called movies that his fans thought were different.Raees, Zero, Swades, Kal Ho Naa Ho, Rab Ne Bana Di Jodi, Kabhie Alvida Naa Kehna.Their are better actors than Shahrukh Khan.Aamir KhanForbes called him the biggest movie star of the world.He met Bill Gates & Hillary Clinton.Ronit RoyThe perfectionist of television.His roles as Aparajit Deb, Mr. Bajaj required much greater acting skills than any of the movies that SRK was a part of.Hrithik RoshanAjay DevgnMore hardworking than Shahrukh ever was.Sanjay DuttAkshay KumarBetter at realistic cinema, comedy, action, and a bigger star as he is known by al pacino.Shahrukh Khan does not learn from his mistakes as an actor.That’s why after Fan he made Jab harry Met Sejal, then after that he still didn’t learn his lesson he decided to star in Zero.He went to USA in 2016 after his previous humiliation in 2012 (also after his first humiliation in 2009).People say he’s a selfmade man and came from poor/middle class family of India but that is simply not true.HERE IS A BRIEF HISTORY OF HIS FAMILY:“Khan was born on 2 November 1965 into a Muslim family in New Delhi. [2] He spent the first five years of his life in Mangalore, where his maternal grandfather, Ifthikar Ahmed, served as the chief engineer of the port in the 1960s. [8][9][b] According to Khan, his paternal grandfather, Jan Muhammad, an ethnic Pashtun, was from Afghanistan. [11] [12] Khan's father, Meer Taj Mohammed Khan, was an Indian independence activist in Peshawar, British India (present-day Pakistan).”He came from a royal background of rich, succesful famous people who had alot of money. His family is filled with ancestors that were important political figures, one was a activist of India’s independence, another was a chief engineer of a port.So he clearly had a strong start as he already had several family members to back him up and guide him, he did not come from any poor family.When your grandfather is the cheif of all engineers, your father is a well paid political acitivist. His other grandfather was born in Afghanistan, while his father was born in Pakistan, and SRK was born in India. (His family was born in three different countries)."
394,"I would like to learn how to stop thinking about what other people think of me. That said, what is the best self help book you've ever read on this subject?"
395,"At first it will seem useless, as you will end up using it for brief notes (you never refer to), clipping web articles (you most likely won’t read again) and creating shopping lists. You can do these with a range of other apps. So for the first few months the benefit will be negligible or zero.The key to finding Evernote useful lies in integrating it with how you work; in my case I use it as my information and ongoing thoughts store. So if I get important emails with attachments, I put them in there, write comments and tags and (depending on how you use Evernote) then put it in a notebook. Other things you can do are add meeting minutes, store other files (with your own summaries attached) and almost replace your paper notebooks. I still use the latter, but now I scan my notebook pages into Evernote (which I can search in). You can create reminders and to do lists.If you dump information into Evernote, it will quickly become chaotic. One useful feature is that you can link different notes (pages) together. This can save a lot of time if you currently have to search lots of emails or various file stores. Tagging and notebooks are critical to staying organised, so look up some tips online.One useful think I have found is to create two folders in My Documents on my computer, one is the working folder where I have for example all Word files I am editing for a particular project. I then have an Evernote Sync folder. Once a document is complete, I move it to the Sync folder and erased from my computer. If I need to find the file again I go to Evernote. Don’t forget that services such as IFTTT and Zapier to connect lots of online services together and can automatically feed information into Evernote. This can include creating a daily summary of all the files changed in shared folders or data from CRM systems. Integration with third party systems such as Google Docs/Drive is useful and improves workflow.Evernote is only useful if you make use of its many features like notebooks, links and tags plus also use it as your main data store. However, if you do that, it is a lifesaver in this age of email and endless Cloud file folder options. Don't forget there are many excellent tutorials online and it is a matter of finding the right usage style for you.A long answer, but I hope it helps. I have no connection with Evernote."

Precisely because they just wanted to be “friends” or “hangout”.Your insecurities, tell you that there's something wrong with your current emotional content.You have every right to feel the way you do, you have every right to make your demands on your relationship, that will bring you piece of mind and conform.It's not like asking her to cut ties with these particular people will have such a devastating effect on her current life.It's not like her want, because is definitely not a need to have contact with this people is detrimental to her happiness. And if she says it is then kick her to the curve.Because it means that this people are holding hostage some of her emotional content and the only way they can do that is that she gave them that power.And no one, especially no other man should have any power over your girls emotional content. You should be the only one that has just some of that power. And that's because she gave it to you.Because of the chemistry you guys have or in this case had. And that's the problem here, shes building this chemistry with other man, which means she will feel affection for these other man. And it doesn't matter if she acts on it or not.The fact that she was willing to share that bond with someone else, while you loose sleep and feel like at any moment your world will be turn upside down is cause for termination.Don't listen to this ridiculous ideas, that's okay if your girl is hanging out with some dude, who has a hard-on for your girl. Because in one moment of weakness (i.e. Drunk, drugs, perfect scenario were you won't find out.) this dude will cream-pie your girl.Don't lie to yourself to think your girl is different. That's shes a saint that couldn't possibly cheat on you. Because you girl is not above the laws of attraction.I know I have done it. Monogamous relationship are not natural. As such there must be a constant, conscious commitment to stay loyal to your partner. And most times that means to cut ties with other humans beings that can potentially alter your emotional content.Essentially cutting ties with threats.And while this idea of layolty is created among the participants of said realitionship, you can bet your ass is okay if one of those ideas is for your girl to stay away from douchebags, like myself who don't care if we fuck your girl and your world up."

I’m not sure if this fits exactly as with lucid dreaming a person has control over their dreams (I can control them at times but not all the time).Like you, even if I’m extremely tired, once I go to sleep my dreams are very vivid, somewhat highly imaginative and sometimes just bizzare. When I wake up I always remember my dreams and can recall them days, months and even years later. It’s a common thing between my friends and I for them to ask ‘what did you dream of yesterday’ as they always find is so fascinating due to not remembering their own dreams!This isn’t a new thing for me either. I’ve been like this since I was very young and growing up, used to frequently confuse dreams for reality. For example, around 8/9 I had a dream that I was driving an uncles car and had crashed it through a local supermarket window. I was convinced this had happened but my family just didn’t want to talk about it with me as every time I brought it up they’d say it was just a dream! Even to this day I still have to remind myself at times that it was actually just a dream (a long with other dreams of course!)Do you by any chance have (or have had) any mental health issues? The reason I ask is that I once suffered from severe social phobia and whilst seeking couselling discussed my very vivid dreams which I was told at the time is quite common amongst those with mental health issues."
402,It has actually come from the old tradition where people used to drink tea more those days than the energy drinks or something.Generally tea break is just for relaxing after a session of play and discuss the plans for next session of play with their team and coach. But of course they drink tea and other stuff just for their relaxation and make them fresh for playing.—— Rithish
403,"I admitted the undergraduate students to MIT for 28 years, nearly 10 as Dean of Admissions.  It is very difficult to describe how one gets admitted because it is a subjective process based on a variety of factors.  But let me say that of all the answers below, Anonymous is closest to the truth.  Simply put, you need a 'hook', which means something so special that it is pretty rare.  (A hook is also known in the admissions business as an 'institutional need', something that the schools want but will never tell the public about.  Div 1 athletes, children of major donors or celebrities, best in state, best in nation, academic superstars, someone who is published in a major publication, etc are examples nationally.  MIT has its own institutional needs that their outstanding admissions office works hard to identify and admit.)  Note that this is not just high scores and perfect grades, as most people believe.  It's different.   As Anonymous says, for MIT  be world-class at something (accent on 'world class'), crush school (that's right - crush it, no excuses) and build writing and interpersonal skills so you can communicate effectively with others.  MIT people are action people so the admissions office is looking for people who regularly make things happen for themselves and others with great self-initiative.  A deeper than normal curiosity is critical because that screams MIT.  And a fearlessness is necessary because not only is MIT the most extraordinary university of its kind on Earth, it's also one of the most demanding.  (There's no place to hide in the curriculum there as one can in Ivy schools.)  Each of these attributes must be represented by actual evidence in the case.  But it's the hook that gets one admitted.If I could tell future applicants anything, it is to understand the culture of the individual school and see if you are a match.  For example, MIT is an action place and so is well suited for action-types and not really that suited for intellectual types.  Also, do not pick a college based on ranking.  That's just ignorance.  All ranking systems have been designed to sell products so they are neither neutral authorities nor really true. You must learn about schools yourself in this era of Big Spin.  That takes work. And most importantly, don't take advice about college admissions from anyone who has never admitted for a living.  Your friends and parents know nothing about such an arcane process and do what we all do - make assumptions about how it appears to work and then act on the assumptions they just made up as if they were true (a process I refer to as M.S.U. - making sh*t up).  That never ends well since it isn't based in truth.I hope this helps."

409,"I get asked a lot about this. I will speak only to my own regrets.We had a very loving relationship, particularly in the beginning.Things escalated fast, we went from long distance relationship to quickly living together, and soon there was pressure for us to get married. We eventually did and that added a type of pressure our relationship wasn’t quite ready for.In terms of regrets, there are a lot of things I would have done differently. As a young hard-headed man, and in the moment, I was blind to a lot of the issues that were afoot. And if I had a chief regret, it would be that I wish I’d been a more attentive husband.The worst part about the divorce is not necessarily the divorce itself, after all, no good marriage ends in divorce.The actual worst part is the descent from a loving relationship to an ugly place where people say and do a lot of things they regret. Things that cloud and pollute the good memories you had.By the time you get to the courtroom, the damage is usually done and the divorce is just a formality."
410,"From the point of view of a basic biological model, yes. However, as you go more into detail, there are plenty of exceptions that might be notable.Natural mutations can occur in cells of living organisms due to a variety of causes, and actually it does so quite often. We have a DNA repair mechanism, but sometimes it fails. Substances that may facilitate this are called carcinogenics, because an accumulation of natural mutations may lead cells to go haywire with uncontrolled replication (i.e. cancer). In addition, many cancers evolve mutations that increase mutability of their DNA.Germline cells create gametes by meiosis. These new cells are, of course, haploid and thus have ""different"" DNA. Not only that, but some epigenetic changes such as Genomic imprinting occur here.Immune cells that create antibodies. Each antibody binds highly specifically to a single antigen structure (epitope), at which point the antibody and its target are removed from the body by white blood cells. Because the body does not know in advance the structures of possible invading cells it needs to catch as many possible structures as possible -- around 10 billion different ones in humans.To achieve this, the immune cells that produce antibodies change their own DNA in the loci that contain the antibody genes. This way, each immune cell has its own signature antibody that it produces like a factory. When a target is actually found corresponding to an antibody, the unique cell that produces it is made to replicate and live longer, so that the recipe for that antibody may be remembered in case of future invasions. This is the principle that drives vaccination.Viruses introduce new DNA into a cell, and some can even insert themselves into their host's chromosomes, i.e. changing their DNA. This is called a provirus.Epigenetic changes do not pertain to the sequence but the structure of the DNA, which changes continually. An extreme and famous example is that of X-inactivation.Mosaics and chimeras are organisms composed of two or more populations of cells with different genomes, due to mutations or other changes early in the developmental state of the zygote. For example, some people have male and female cells in different parts of their bodies.I'm sure there are plenty more examples, but these are the ones that I come up with off the top of my head."
411,"It is always right to be open and honest about your feelings, with one caveat:You have to think about the person you are talking to. Being open about your feelings always feels good, but if you are making someone uncomfortable, or jumping into something deep without an understanding about how that person feels, then it turns in to a selfish impulse.So it depends on your immediate circumstance. You know a girl, a friend, and think it’s time to try and take it to the next level? By all means, tell her that you are interested. Don’t say she has your undying love (just yet), even if you feel that way. :)If the girl is a stranger, don’t say anything at all until you know her better.Finally, after considering all the above, and don’t let a potential friendship or relationship die because you were a little too timid to make a move.Good luck!"

And the weird nature of the medical releases made by the Trump campaign, and the candidate’s persistent claims to have “great stamina” (something which stimulants would make much easier to sustain) and the campaign’s constant attacks regarding his opponent’s health put his own health quite fairly into legitimate question.Instead, Trump’s campaign has taken the position that there were no sniffles; apparently, those weird snuffly noises we were hearing were caused by a “defective microphone”."

417,"According to http://monsterhunter.wikia.com/w...The biggest ones are Raviente and Dalamadur. Raviente is only found in the Japan-Only Monster Hunter frontier online. It is a colossal tusked snake that is apparently fought by up to 16 people over the course of three in-game days, and is the size of a small island. A size isn't given on the wiki. Dalamadur also looks like a huge snake, except it has front legs as well. It is found in Monster Hunter 4 Ultimate. It is covered in spines and has a devastating breath attack that can one-shot underprepared players.The Wiki lists it's size at about 44,000 cm, making it about 44 kilometers long. That would probably qualify it for the title of ""largest""."

423,"Currently Uber is the only ride share operating in Springfield, but Lyft will be here in a week or so. From what I have heard, Lyft has a much more rigorous “interview” portion for new drivers, so their drivers are probably a little better than Uber, but most Uber drivers are excellent.The taxi providers here absolutely blow. They charge an arm and a leg compared to Uber and the vehicle are usually run down, with driver’s who are late, even you called them 2 hours in advance of when you need them. If you go with Uber, you better not request that ride until you’re ready to go! The most you will wait is 10–15 minutes, but usually it’s less than 5.Also, taxi services are a cash only business. Uber is totally cash-less. Me being a person who doesn't carry cash, Uber is my speed. Lyft, being an online ride share app as well, is also cash-less."
424,"It is a problem of free energy. The charged molecule (depending on polarity) prefers to interact with the polar/charged heads of the membrane (the outside). The inside is non-polar/hydrophobic. The de-solvation barrier of the molecule in question alone is enough to prevent its passive diffusion through. Otherwise, the molecule would have to physically change the permittivity of the membrane to enter the hydrophobic part.Some charged molecules/ions (e.g. chaotropes) can actually adsorb and change the permittivity of the charged membrane. They become more permeable to water, and maybe this will cause leakage. But in general, thermodynamically, diffusion of polar and charged molecules is not favorable, at least in a kinetic time-scale that matters."
425,"Being in a polygamous relationship is nice once you finally decide to try it and let go of what it means to be monogamous, which means to somewhat force yourself to only love that one person.A polygamous relationship gives you a lot of freedom and is very healthy as long as everybody involved is happy with the situation. Not everybody in a polygamous relationship are the same, and not all said relationships are the same either.Some people are in a polygamous relationship with people who also have multiple partners ( IE: 1 guy can have 3 girlfriends, and each of those girlfriends might have 2 boyfriends each )But some relationships ( like mine ) are some where a select number of guys/girls are in a relationship with one person. I have three boyfriends who all love me and I love them all as well. Two of them are twin brothers and the other is a good friend of theirs. They apparently all fell in love with me because I was one of the few girls who was nice to them, and eventually we ended up in a four way relationship and we are still very happy today ( Started the relationship when I was fifteen. Currently 19 )We made sure to keep it secret from the public, since it isn’t seen very well by many cultures. But if you’re willing to give up the pride of letting everyone know you’re in love with someone, or many someones in this case, it’s definitely worth while. You feel a lot safer when you have more partners, and the guys don’t mind sharing me at all, which is a big thing. You don’t want anyone in the relationship to be jealous, otherwise it can ruin it for everyone.When it comes to sex, there are many avenues you can take: Sex with one at a time, or sex with multiple/all partners at the same time. This is something that can also be helpful, as if one person doesn’t quite feel like sex, you have others that you love that might be in the mood. If everyone is in the mood you can try group sex, which is an amazing experience on its own.Overall I recommend it. If you can manage to forget the words of the many that judge you for what you decided to do with your own love life, it’s a wonderful experience that should never be completely dismissed!"

Both have beach attractions, but you can only see Coney Island-type of attractions in Brooklyn. Only Staten Island has got the ferry that allows you to have a more closer view of Lady Liberty. Generally my impressions of parks in both are similar, although I find that Brooklyn’s Prospect Park is admittedly better known than Staten Island’s Silver Lake or Clove Lakes.Brooklyn has the Brooklyn Bridge Park, but Staten Island has got Sailors Snug Harbor. Plus, with the emerging Fresh Kills Park in Staten Island, you’ll find it hard looking for something similar in Brooklyn. But then again, you can see Floyd Bennett Field in Brooklyn, which is also a huge, expansive park, being formerly among NYC’s airports converted into a park. Oh, well, you can find Jacques Marchais museum of Tibetan Art only in Staten Island. So, whichever attractions you’ll decide to visit in either borough will call for you to draw from your personal preferences, time, inclinations plus available logistics.You can take:the bus that crosses both boroughs via the Verrazzano Bridgethe train (R, 4, 5, J,Z) from White Hall, Bowling Green, or Broad Street. Then walk the distance to the South Ferry station of the Staten Island ferry boat.your own car to cross the I-278 via the Verrazzano Bridge again. Or take a cab."
428,"I take Spirulina daily 3 grams AM and 3 grams PM and I have been doing this for many years. I have noticed my health is more balanced and easier to maintain since I have been taking it.

The blue-green algae shot to fame in the 1970s when National Aeronautical and Space Agency (NASA), USA, used it for astronauts food in space Spirulina is rich in proteins (60%), amino acids, essential fatty acids, Gamma-linolenic acid (GLA) fatty acids, nucleic acids (DNA and RNA), beta-carotene (pro-vitamin A), vitamins- B, C & E, minerals like iron, potassium, magnesium, sodium, phosphorus and calcium, and phytochemicals such as chlorophyll (the green pigment) and phycocyanin (a blue pigment). Its outstanding nutritional profile, high protein and low calorie count makes it a ‘superfood’.Centuries ago, the Aztecs and the Mayas realised the healing properties of spirulina and enjoyed this source of vegetable nutrition as a ‘power-food’ to boost their energy levels and enhance stamina.Recent scientific research has revealed numerous health benefits of this ‘super-food’. Spirulina has been shown to help regulate blood sugar, blood pressure and cholesterol, alleviate pain, inflammation and allergies, balance the immune system, improve digestion by increasing good gut flora and deliver antioxidant activity to protect from life-threatening diseases like cancer, Alzheimers and strokes.It has also been shown to suppress appetite and help weight watchers. Its high beta-carotene content helps maintain good skin and hair.A study conducted at the JC Bose Institute of Life Sciences, Bundelkhand University, Jhansi, published in ‘Current Pharmaceutical Biotechnology’ in 2005, reported that spirulina improves the activity of white blood cells, stimulates antibodies and increases the population of natural killer cells.Spirulina’s concentrated nutrition makes it an ideal food supplement for people of all ages and lifestyles, fussy eaters and especially those who do not manage to eat adequate amount of vegetables. However, pregnant and lactating women and people allergic to seafood or seaweed must consult their physician.Tropical weather, strong sunshine, pure water resource and pollution-free environment is all what Spirulina needs for its cultivation. However, if water is polluted or contaminated with heavy metals, it is not suitable for spirulina cultivation as these metals and toxins will get highly concentrated in spirulina and make it unsuitable for human consumption. Hence, the source and purity of spirulina is critical.Commercially, Spirulina is available in the form of powder, tablet, capsule and health tonic. It can be added to soups, pastas, fruits, vegetables, salads, pulses and lentils. Being high on nutrition and easy on digestion, it certainly is a good addition to our daily diet."

432,"The syllabus for UGC NET English is extremely vast, but unfortunately there is no shortcut-it is a continuous process, there is no point starting a month before the test and thinking you’re going to clear it. You need to strictly dedicate a certain amount of time every day for the preparation; make it part of our routine. Firstly, one has to be thorough with one's MA coursework. Get a general idea about all literary periods (right from Chaucer to the postmodern/contemporary), major authors and their works.Make sure to have read a standard history of British literature book- A Critical History of English Literature by David Daiches, History of English Literature by Edward Albert, An Outline History of English Literature by W H Hudson are some of the affordable choices. Also read Beginning Theory by Peter Barry. While you are reading through these, make sure to collect as much info as possible about each important author/critic and works mentioned in it. You could use the Oxford Companion to English Literature for this. It is a costly book to buy, but most libraries will have a copy in their reference section. Or you could buy the Concise version which is affordable and supplement it with info you collect from the web and the library. Reading entries from the Oxford companion (the latest edition is better as it will be the most updated) daily will help us to learn about works and authors from other literatures like American literature, Post-colonial literatures, world literatures in English etc that you won't find in the British literature history texts.Another important step is to be thorough with terms from M H Abrams' Glossary of Literary Terms. You need to make sure to have studied at least one or two entries from the Glossary daily.Also stay updated on contemporary developments in the field of literature especially the important literary awards like the Booker Prize, Pulitzer Prize, Nobel Prize etc.Maintaining a healthy reading habit is also important. Also solve previous question papers to get an idea about the kind of questions asked.An important step: Do not ignore Paper I as many people tend to do, because it is easy to score marks in this paper, which will help in increasing your average percentage, and thereby the chances of making the cut-off. You may buy any good guide for Paper I available in the market and practice as many sample questions as possible.While the NET is a hard nut to crack, with timely and systematic preparation, it is doable. Simply solving previous question papers is not enough, you need to develop good knowledge of your subject. Combined study is a good idea if you have friends who are also preparing for the same. All the best! :)"
433,"The European diet was heavy on grains (minus maize, of course), heavy on the brassicas like cabbage, and used Old World spices like black pepper and cinnamon, cloves, grains of paradise, etc.There was, of course, much greater regional variety. While Italy may have been growing rice, wheat, and barely, northern European countries were eating oats and rye in greater quantities than they do now.Thee was no Turkey, but there were Guinea Fowl brought up from Africa. Game was important as long as forests existed. Fish was big along the coasts and rivers, and drying, salting, or smoking them made them available inland.Cows and their milk (and the cheeses made from them) were important dietary items, but so too were sheep and (regionally) goats.  In fact, if you just take away the New World foods from today's diet and you pretty much have what they were eating then. Northern Italian, Swiss, Eastern European, and Scandinavian diets of today are quite close to their historic forebears'."

436,"Unfortunately Angular 2 is pushing users very hard to use TypeScript instead of Babel, but this should not be an obstacle for learning the framework as TypeScript is very easy to pick up if you're competent with JavaScript.I love JavaScript, but I'm a also a huge fan TypeScript. I think it's absolutely the way to go if you're looking for either an improved tooling, value static analysis, or are simply looking for a reliable, high-quality ECMAScript transpiler.Having said having said that, as appropriate TypeScript you may wonder why I consider Angular 2’s push toward TypeScript unfortunate. The primary reason is that Angular 2 uses TypeScript in a very awkward, non idiomatic, and frankly confusing and off-putting way. It's a terrible introduction to the language that will confuse just about anyone because what the end of their team wanted was a language with reified types and TypeScript is not that language. All of the types in TypeScript code exist for static analysis, tooling, and static code verification. They are by design completely erased from the emitted JavaScript. One very big caveat to this is classes which JavaScript programmers tend to think of it types but are actually values. Since TypeScript models class-based programming patterns, to a degree, it can be confusing to distinguish between the runtime and compile time nature of a class in TypeScript. Angular 2 complete these things with reckless abandon and to the detriment of its users and itself. It tries to pretend the TypeScript and by extension JavaScript are different languages than they actually are, trying to see them as more like Java, but this is not a viable way of coding. Typescript get this right, it tries to model JavaScript with types that match the way the language behaviors and is used, and stays true to its dynamic nature.Definitely learn TypeScript it's well worth it, but learn JavaScript first. If you learn typescript by way of Angular 2 you will likely end up with a distorted view of the language. For example of one of TypeScript's main purposes is to provide tooling and static checking but Angular 2’s APIs are loosely typed to the point of almost an almost 100% negating this benefit.It's also it's also worth mentioning that it's very pleasant and productive using AngularJS 1.5 with TypeScript."
437,"I used to have this problem.  As a teenager, I would stay up until 4 in the morning playing World of Warcraft, crawl into bed, and still not be able to fall asleep.  It was terrible.A bunch of doctors suggested medication and/or sleeping pills.  I was never one for that sort of ""answer,"" so I chose insomnia instead.It wasn't until a few years ago that I started meditating, and I was finally able to fall asleep.  Now, I lie down and am asleep within 30 seconds, and I don't wake up until my alarm goes off.This is something that takes practice, but too many people mistake their busy thoughts as ""themselves,"" and either accept insomnia or resort to sleeping pills—neither of which are very desirable, in my opinion.  We all need sleep!  To meditate, simply sit in a comfortable, upright position (I usually sit on the floor with my back against a wall.  Comfortable enough, but not so comfortable as a chair that I'll fall asleep).  Close your eyes, place your hands on your knees (palms up if you want to feel more buddha, palms down if you're still that ""this shit doesn't work"" phase),  and breathe deeply.  You will hear your thoughts very loudly.  Don't tell them to shut up—this will only make them louder.  Instead, just listen.  Breathe and listen.  Stay there for at least five minutes.  Shoot for ten.  Fifteen and you get a gold star.Do this every day for six months and let me know what happens.  My guess: sleep."

439,"Withdrawing high denomination currency notes [demonetization] has been done before [1946, 1978]. However, I believe the present move [2016] might have a bigger impact than the one done by British India and Morarji Desai. This is a move I have been dreaming for years and glad that it was done.The fact that the government was able to do this so secretly in such a connected manner speaks volumes. Indira Gandhi tried this in early 1970s, but could not as the move leaked out and the bad guys quickly changed over the notes. The government had to back out of the move then. I’m even thinking if the move to ban NDTV was just a ploy to distract the whole media, to pull this off. And it was possibly scheduled on US election day likely to get the global media off the heat and attention, as foreign media has been ultracritical & condescending of any major move in India.There are 5 key incentives for this:Bringing out illicit money sloshed stashed in the parallel economyHaving a lid on the fake money racket supported by our western neighborIncentivizing India to go cashless. The banks would not hand you wads of the new cash, but will just credit the money to your bank account in place of your old currency.Moving the notes to a more secure standard - with better protection against counterfeiting.Curbing inflation in real estate and reducing gold imports.As the 6th incentive, it would impact coalitions ahead of the major elections in UP and Punjab. It is not shocking that elections, especially in these states with multidimensional politics [a lot of parties fighting] involve a lot of illicit money. MLAs get traded like horses - with suitcases of cash. Some of that trading will get impacted.Unlike in the past, I don’t see much impact on normal users of currency. The transactions that happen on Rs. 500 and Rs. 1000 should be moving to netbanking/cheque/cards anyway. If someone is still holding out against modern transaction methods, this is the opportunity to come out from under the rock.For the poor who don’t have debit/credit cards, there might not be much impact either - as most of their transaction happen under Rs. 500.Impact of the move1. Black Money & corruption: The impact on black money usage will be temporary as those would eventually move to the new Rs. 2000 notes in time. Also, a lot of the black money lies in real estate, gold and other physical things. Still even a temporary, small impact on this sector is better than nothing. The mere fear of government taking out your black money is good enough. That the government could so secretly do this will increase the fear.2. Elections: Especially with the major elections barely weeks away, the move would impact politics in the crucial states. My guess is that the government waited for the Diwali to pass [will be a huge pain for many to have this move before the festival] and do it reasonably before the elections [EC could throw a spanner on any major move just before the elections]. Thus, unlike the previous occasions, the government didn’t do this on January 16. It could have impact on corruption in those elections and it is a way of the government saying, “Maha Gathbandhan, Check”.3. Counterfeiting: The impact on the counterfeit notes would be more significant. Many “dealers” with the existing counterfeit notes would be stuck as they would have to take the notes to the bank and have better chances of getting their racket exposed. Thus, they are more likely to destroy their notes and incur losses. Losses to the bad guys is good and maybe some of them could get shot unable to pay their debts. It would be quite hard to counterfeit the new currency and until they develop the technology for that, there will be an impact on counterfeit notes and terrorism that is funded through that.4. Cashless society. All of the above things are temporary things. But, I believe the long lasting one could be in moving cashless. The pain of transferring cash could incentivize many to think about going bits and plastic. Today could be a day to introspect for the legal users of the currency. That could have a more significant impact on counterfeiting and unaccounted money.5. Gold/silver. In the short term, gold and silver buying will be hampered, as a lot of the buyers buy with their black money. That means less importing. Over the long term, there might be more purchase of gold as the black money guys will be afraid to hold too much cash.6. Real Estate. In the short term, prices of real estate would come down for the same reason above. There will be less suitcases moving. It is not clear what would happen to this sector in the long term. Maybe there could be a little more land buying, but that could be neutralized by the spiraling down of the prices that could go now.7. Markets. This is overall a positive move that is lauded by a lot of people and could bring more confidence in Indian markets by overseas investors. However, the exit of black money temporarily could cause other repercussions in buying. I would not be surprised if the market goes a bit down in the short and medium term.8. Overseas Indians. There is a lot of INR that gets transacted outside of India. Technically it is illegal [NRIs, foreigners can’t leave with rupee], but there are not many practical alternatives. They would be impacted as they cannot change the money to the new notes quickly and those overseas currency trading markets on rupee would be impacted [UAE money exchanges won’t accept notes in India recall]. Some of these transactions are good ones that improve the economy, while others might help Dawood bhai like ones.9. Banking to all. The government’s key objective is to bring banking to all and this will help that. If you have more than Rs. 4000, the bank will not give you new notes, but will just ask you to open an account and credit it there. This when followed with the fees on ATM transactions will make it harder to transact on cash.10. Consumption and economy. This is one thing I believe it is going to be negative. Black money drives a lot of the economy and now that it is gone, it will impact consumption levels. There could be a deflation and damp economic growth for a couple of quarters. In the long run it doesn’t matter though.Think about this. India’s total tangible wealth is of the order of 280 lakh crores. World bank estimates at least a quarter of this is black. That means 70 lakh crores. It is possible that 10% of it is in cash, with the rest in real estate and gold. That is 7 lakh crores of black cash that is lying around. Maybe 80% of it will turn white and even with that Rs 1.4 lakh crores of black will be gone. That is big.The government gave the black money holders enough time [until Sept 30] to come clean [Black money: Rs. 65,250 crore disclosed under Income Declaration Scheme] and following up on its warnings would make them take the government seriously in this aspect.On the whole, the government has announced that it is alive and bold. At a time it looked like the government was sagging and losing speed, it is a time to reinvigorate."

I only know the term from old Scooby Doo episodes.We don't have the word “Taffy” here, so if anyone wants taffy (rather than toffee or fudge), they would need to make it or import it.I asked an American living here what it was and I seem to remember she said it was softer than toffee, but not the same as fudge. If so, it might be different enough to import some, but probably not different enough to displace those two very popular types of traditional sweets*. If there aren't many people who want it, its unlikely to be economic to make it here. Especially if part of its appeal is in being a traditional american sweet.*I like bonfire toffee the best.

443,"I admitted the undergraduate students to MIT for 28 years, nearly 10 as Dean of Admissions.  It is very difficult to describe how one gets admitted because it is a subjective process based on a variety of factors.  But let me say that of all the answers below, Anonymous is closest to the truth.  Simply put, you need a 'hook', which means something so special that it is pretty rare.  (A hook is also known in the admissions business as an 'institutional need', something that the schools want but will never tell the public about.  Div 1 athletes, children of major donors or celebrities, best in state, best in nation, academic superstars, someone who is published in a major publication, etc are examples nationally.  MIT has its own institutional needs that their outstanding admissions office works hard to identify and admit.)  Note that this is not just high scores and perfect grades, as most people believe.  It's different.   As Anonymous says, for MIT  be world-class at something (accent on 'world class'), crush school (that's right - crush it, no excuses) and build writing and interpersonal skills so you can communicate effectively with others.  MIT people are action people so the admissions office is looking for people who regularly make things happen for themselves and others with great self-initiative.  A deeper than normal curiosity is critical because that screams MIT.  And a fearlessness is necessary because not only is MIT the most extraordinary university of its kind on Earth, it's also one of the most demanding.  (There's no place to hide in the curriculum there as one can in Ivy schools.)  Each of these attributes must be represented by actual evidence in the case.  But it's the hook that gets one admitted.If I could tell future applicants anything, it is to understand the culture of the individual school and see if you are a match.  For example, MIT is an action place and so is well suited for action-types and not really that suited for intellectual types.  Also, do not pick a college based on ranking.  That's just ignorance.  All ranking systems have been designed to sell products so they are neither neutral authorities nor really true. You must learn about schools yourself in this era of Big Spin.  That takes work. And most importantly, don't take advice about college admissions from anyone who has never admitted for a living.  Your friends and parents know nothing about such an arcane process and do what we all do - make assumptions about how it appears to work and then act on the assumptions they just made up as if they were true (a process I refer to as M.S.U. - making sh*t up).  That never ends well since it isn't based in truth.I hope this helps."

445,"This is getting more relevant each day, as we get closer and closer to a war between Iran and Israel. These are the news headlines:Analysis: The open war with Iran has begunIran and Israel: A War BrewingIran’s Intensifying War with IsraelSo who would win a case of a war between Iran and Israel?I believe that Iran actually does have the military capability to launch an invasion of Israel, and without the use of nuclear weapons, successfully bring an end to Israel. Here’s why Iran will win a war against Israel:Iran’s military is progressing at an alarming rate. Let me give you an example: In 2017 Iran’s military was rated to be 21st best military in the world, by the Global firepower Index. In 2018 it jumped 8 spots ahead, and does now has the 13th strongest military in the world, ahead of Israel’s military, that is ranked as the 16th strongest in the world. As Iran industrializes further, don’t be surprised if Iran completely leaves Israel in the dust in the future.Iran has a MUCH larger population. Iran has a population of around 83 million citizens, while Israel only has 8 million inhabitants. In other words, Iran has a population 10x larger than Israel. For every Israeli, there are 10 Iranians. This gives Iran a huge advantage, as it means that it can mobilize a much larger army. Currently Iran’s army has 534.000 active military personnel, while the Israeli army only has 170.000 active military personnel. However there are also the Iranian Basiji paramilitary force, that has more than 6–7 million members, and the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, with over a 100.000 active military personnel.Iran has a lot more allies in the region. Lebanon, Syria, Iraq, Qatar, Southern Yemen, Palestine and Turkey are all Iranian allies, while Israel currently has zero allies in the Middle East. Of these countries Lebanon, Syria and Palestine, border Israel. This means that Iran could launch a quick surprise attack, with it’s allies Hezbollah, the Syrian and Iraqi government. (Provided of course that both civil wars are over.) Hezbollah alone has more than 100.000 missiles all pointed at Israel. Combine that with Iran’s military wrath and you will get a complete annihilation of Israel.The powerful Shia militias in the other parts of the Middle East, should also be included. Of these the most well known and strongest are:The Popular Mobilization Force (150.000 soldiers)The Badr Brigade (30.000–40.000 soldiers)The Imam Mahdi Army (40.000–50.000 soldiers)The Fatimeyoun Militia (20.000–30.000 soldiers)All these militias does have direct connections to the Iranian regime. Below is a picture of a parade in Iraq by The Popular Mobilization Force, carrying a giant portrayal of the Iranian supreme leader, Imam Khameini:Also Israel might have a technological advantage, however they wont in 10 years. The Israeli leaders know this, Iran is quickly closing the gap.An important fact is that Israel has a lot of nuclear weapons. However, in case of a war, Iran could quickly go back to enrich uranium:Iran: Five days needed to ramp up uranium enrichmentIran says can produce highly enriched uranium in days if U.S. quits...There wouldn’t go many days before Iran would also gain nuclear weapons.However, the Iranian regime is going to have a hard time convincing the Iranian people to go and sacrifice themselves for a war against Israel, that they don’t want. This of course will be changed if Israel started carpet bombing Iranian cities, but until then the Iranian Army’s motivation won’t be at it’s highest, as Israel will literally fight for their survival, and Iran won’t.A war between Iran and Israel will be a waste of human lives, money and time. If just the leaders of the two countries were as eager to negotiate a peace treaty in the Middle East, as they are to start a war.The Iranian people don’t hold any grudge against normal Israeli’s as they differentiate between the people and the government. Both countries could learn a lot from each other in many different aspects, but sadly they choose not to.In the meanwhile, let’s just hope for peace across the region, and learn to accept and live with each other, despite our differences.Sorces:2018 Military Strength RankingPrivate Iranian militias - WikipediaLiwa Fatemiyoun - WikipediaIslamic Revolutionary Guard Corps - WikipediaIran closing technology gap with Israel, Military Intelligence chief warns"

447,"Do you want to know what natural numbers really are?This is how they are set-theoretically defined at the very heart of all of mathematics, and anybody can understand it.In mathematics, we must start with some completely unambiguous mental concept that we have in common. What do we have in common?Nothing.So we start with nothing. The empty set, denoted {}{}\{ \} . The things inside the curly brackets are what is inside the set. As you can see, there is nothing in there, and when we regard it as a set, this amounts to conceptualizing it. {}{}\{\} is the concept of nothing, the empty set. This is the number 000, literally.Good. Now that we have the concept of nothing in common, we have in common the concept of the concept of nothing! This is the set containing the empty set, {{}}{{}} \{ \{ \} \} . This is the number 111, literally.Now that we have the concept of nothing and the concept of the concept of nothing, we have the concept of those two things! This is 222, formally written as {{},{{}}}{{},{{}}}\{ \{ \} , \{ \{ \} \} \} , the set that contains both the empty set and the set containing the empty set.Now we have three concepts in common, all built from nothing: 0,1,0,1,0, 1,  and 222. You can see what we do next: the concept of these three concepts is the number 333.Recursively, each natural number 𝑛nn is the set of its predecessors. This definition even applies to 000, which has no predecessors.So the natural numbers are:000 = {}{}\{\}111 = {{}}   {{}}   \{ \{\} \} \ \ \   ( = {0}{0} \{ 0 \})222 = {{},{{}}}   {{},{{}}}   \{ \{\}, \{ \{\} \} \} \ \ \  ( = {0,1}{0,1} \{ 0, 1 \})333 = {{},{{}},{{},{{}}}}   {{},{{}},{{},{{}}}}   \{ \{\}, \{ \{\} \}, \{ \{\}, \{ \{\} \} \} \} \ \ \  ( = {0,1,2}{0,1,2} \{ 0, 1, 2 \})⋮⋮ \vdots 𝑛={0,1,…,𝑛−1}n={0,1,…,n−1}n = \{ 0, 1, \ldots, n-1 \} That is what the natural numbers truly are. And as you can see, each number 𝑛nn contains precisely 𝑛nn things.We start with literally nothing, and then we have the concept of nothing, then the concept of the concept of nothing, and so on.It is thus that mathematics is built from thinking about nothing."

450,"1.Space: Space mean universe. You ever wondered, can light go across our universe? Answer is NO! The space is expanding at a speed which is far more than speed of light, and it is increasing. This phenomenon is called as metric expansion of universe. The rate of expansion of space is 67.15 ± 1.2 (km/s)/Mpc, roughly 68 (km/s)/Mpc.Metric expansion of space - Wikipedia2. Quantum entanglement : Actually this does not violates the Relativity as nothing happens which is faster than light. But when two quantum particles are entangled you can predict state other particle with respect to other irrespective of it's position in space. It might be at the other end of universe but still you can predict state of other particle and you can manipulate the state of other particle wrt here. And it does not takes any time to happen. So quantum entanglement is faster than light.3. LASER: Suppose you're pointing a strong laser towards moon and suddenly you change it's position. This slight misalignment will cause a movement of geometrical position of spot of light faster than speed of light. A laser is a unique source of light. But you'll ask if laser is a source of light then how come light travels faster than light itself. Actually, photons does travel at speed of light. But if you measure geometrical distance the spot of light travel in certain time. You'll get speed more than light.4.You but only through Wormhole: Einstein has hypothesized wrap in space time through which one travel through space and time. This would make you travel faster than light. But this would require tremendous amount of energy and there are no experimental proofs of this phenomenon.5.

451,"It feels like PURE ADRENALINE.  I served as a firefighter and a rescue crew chief in the US Air Force for three and half years, and during that time I fought many different kinds of fires.  It's hard to explain what firefighting feels like in the abstract because every fire is unique, but let me try a little thought experiment with you to give you a general idea.As you are reading this look around the room you are in.  Note where the windows, doors and furniture are.  Now try to reconstruct the adjoining room from your memory.  You've probably been in that particular room before, so you should have a fairly good idea where everything is.Now imagine that you can't see anything.  The fire has shorted out electricity to the building (or the fire department has shut if off for their own safety), so all of the lights have gone out, and the room is rapidly filling with thick gray smoke, so much smoke that not even sunlight can get in.At first you think to yourself, ""I can get out of here--I've been in here before, and I know my way out.""  But that was when you were walking upright and could see.  Now imagine doing it on your hands and knees because the smoke is toxic and superheated, so you can't stand up in it.  So imagine yourself blinded and crawling on your hands and knees trying to FEEL your way out.Imagine how hard that would be, especially if you had the added stress of actually being in a burning building.  Now imagine that you had never been in that building before--that's what it feels like to be a firefighter.  The only difference is that the firefighter is rushing in while you're rushing out.As a firefighter you constantly find yourself rushing into completely unknown situations where you might be injured or killed--you don't know what is on fire, you don't know the layout of the building, you don't know who is in the building, you don't know whether the roof is about to collapse, you don't know if your equipment will fail or you will run out of air at the wrong time--it's a laundry list of unknowns, but you go in anyway because you are so hopped up on adrenaline that you think you can do anything.Another aspect of firefighting that many people may be unaware of is the fact that it engages all five of your senses, and because you are high on adrenaline, time slows down and you become even more acutely aware of your surroundings.  Here are just a few examples from my own experience:Sight:  In a typical house fire you can't see anything when you first enter the building.  The smoke is simply too thick.  You're wearing a breathing apparatus with a face mask, but that doesn't really help you see--it just keeps the smoke out of your eyes and lungs.  As you get closer to the fire you can start to see a faint orange glow through the smoke, and as you get closer its gets brighter.  At that point, however, you should be putting water on the fire, and as soon as you do that, the water instantly converts to steam and the color goes from gray to white, but you still can't see very much, if anything.Touch:  Being in a fire is hot, super hot.  One time I got first degree burns on my skin because my sweat turned to steam and scalded me.  Right about that same time my air ran out, so I went outside and took off my mask.  One of the medics noticed how red my face was, so they made me strip off my jacket, and then they hosed me off to cool me down.  Another time the clear face mask on my helmet bubbled and warped from the extreme heat.  At the same time you are feeling this heat, however, your overall sense of touch is dramatically diminished because you are wearing gloves and heavy protective equipment.  One time we responded to a fire where kids were reported to still be in the house.  I was the first one in, so I was searching the living room on my hands and knees unable to see anything through the smoke.  I felt a soft form roughly the size of a small child under the dining room table, but I couldn't tell what it was through the gloves and the smoke, so I scooped it up and carried it outside.  It wasn't until I was outside in fresh air that I could see it was the family dog, not one of their children.Sound:  You've probably heard a campfire crackle and pop before.  Now imagine that the crackling and popping sound is coming at you from every direction, above you, below you, in front of you, behind you, and to the sides.  The reason is because everything that's on fire is making noise--the floors, the walls, the ceiling--it's everywhere.  You can also hear strange noises like light bulbs popping, walls creaking, glass breaking, mattress springs letting loose, things falling over, etc.  Another unmistakable sound is the sound of water flashing into steam as you spray it on the superheated ceiling, which is quickly followed by an eerie stillness that fills the room as the fire starts to go out.  Then there is the ever-present sound of your breathing in the breathing apparatus.  It sounds like a scuba diver, and it's actually a pretty comforting sound, because it means you're still alive.  There is, however, one sound that you never want to hear in your breathing apparatus, and that is the warning bell on your air tank telling you that you have less than 5 minutes of air left.Smell:  When you are responding to a fire you can often catch a whiff of the fire before you get there, and it can tell you a lot about what is burning (i.e., whether it is oil, wood, furniture, a car, etc.).  Once you put your mask on and enter the fire, however, you can't really smell much of anything except the rubber smell of your mask, your own sweat, and a smokey smell that is lingering on your equipment from previous fires.  At some point after the fire is out, however, you'll take your mask off, and then you'll experience a whole new range of smells depending on what had been burning--wood, plastic, carpet, clothes, paint, gas, paper, food, etc.Taste:  It's hard to explain, but you can sometimes even taste a fire.  It's probably really just a function of smell, but if you inhale a lot of smoke or get some soot in your mouth--which might not actually happen during the firefighting but later when you are doing the mop up--then you can get this smokey taste in your mouth that can stay with you for awhile.So far I have mainly described the physical sensations of firefighting, but there is another far more powerful feeling that comes from firefighting, and that is the overwhelming feeling of satisfaction and accomplishment that comes from saving someone's life.  I can't even begin to describe it, but it's as real, powerful, and memorable as any of the physical sensations I have ever experienced fighting fire."
452,"My opinion is that the main reason for the data inconsistency is in current variable update methods (commands) of SQL ,NoSQL and Object databases, not in ACID questions.Currently, you do not have a simple update method which you could use for all (complex) update cases. Instead you must write a lot of ad-hoc code for different kinds of complex update cases. That makes things easily inconsistent and unclear.I believe that we need a single, efficient, declarative update method to update different kinds of databases, or more generally, distributed memories. The method should be called with the root object of a modified object structure in-the run-time memory as a single parameter.I invented such a method which I have just introduced hereA New Communication Theory on Complex Information and a Groundbreaking New Declarative Method to Update Object DatabasesThe name of the method is embed.One idea of this method is to make updating distributed memory as easy as maintaining structures in a local memory. This helps to avoid inconsistencies because programmers are quit good to manipulate local data structures even complex ones. Another other idea of the method is that it is efficient. This is important because other ways it would be practically useless. Consistency is inside the embed method. It always leaves the database in an consistent state after a complex update operation. It, for example, removes automatically possible structures of garbage objects from the database if those structures appear during a complex update operation.The method applies quite advance techniques behind it, like an garbage collection methods and a new communication theory for complex information represented as a directed graph of nodes. But it is quite  easy to understand if you understand something about graphs. There is also a test version of the method which shows that the method does the required “magic things” in all possible cases you can imagine.I agree with other writers there are many other things affecting for consistency in a practical world, with different kinds of systems, and depending on perspective."

454,"There exists no true synonym for that particular verb in all its forms. I assert this because one can define it in English in seven different ways. A word that ambiguous can cause real frustration. I find it far more useful and effective to avoid it altogether.By way of example, you won't find it in the above paragraph. Or this one. But you might in the next. Or not.One other answer refers to E-Prime, developed by a student of Alfred Korzybski’s philosophy of General Semantics. Practicing it allows you to clear your thinking, replacing “to be” with whatever you actually mean by it. I highly recommend it as an exercise.(Please permit me to also recommend Language in Thought and Action by S.I. Hayakawa and Alan Hayakawa.)"
455,"Basically two things to bring up.  First, the player setting the screen needs to have his/her feet planted (not moving.). Second, and similar to the first, the player setting the screen cannot immediately and actively continue to ""get in the way"" of the player he just screened (or another defender for that matter.) This would be akin to blocking in American football (which is legal in football if you aren't holding the defender.) Not so shocking, many basketball players also play or used to play American football.  An illegal screen happens a lot on a ""pick and role situation"", when after ""the role"" the player who just set the pick continues to step in the way of defenders rather than freeing themselves up for a shot.  Other illegal uses I see a lot are when a really tall player uses his/her next step and exploiting their size to immediately get in the way of a defender (without being firmly planted.). It's highly unlikely you set up two sequential screens immediately right after the first one, yet players loose sight of this during a game, or they are actively breaking the rules withy the hope to not get called.  Bottom line is when a screen is set, the player setting the screen must stay still and they cannot immediately take a step and really expect that they are setting another screen.Note that after setting a screen you are obviously allowed to move and even try to get a get position."
456,"Knowledge kills curiosity. So you have to unlearn all the stuff which you have learnt. It might seem stupid for first time but mind you it is the only way.Have you ever thought why small children are always happy?You also must be a happy child but happiness went away gradually with increase in age.Just imagine when you had seen sun for the first time then how much curious you were to know what it is, you did not knew its name.You just saw it with mind full of curiosity but when someone told you that it is sun and you got the knowledge about sun then your curiosity just went away as you know it is sun then what is the point looking at it.Same has happened to you with every aspect of life, you have known whatever you wanted to know, now you don't want to know anything because with your experience of knowing things deep down in your heart you know that knowing things didnot helped you in past.Knowledgeable mind always tells you the facts which you have known about the things when you see or think.Like if you see a flower- you will say it is rose, I know it but you missed the unknown present in rose.First thing to do is - When ever you see something donot pay attention to thoughts which your mind will create according to your past knowledge of that thing. Try to see the things like you are looking them for the first time, donot give names to the things in mind when you see them.Second important thing is to learn the art of- Being in the present.Mind always thinks weather of past or future, it never stays in the present which is the cause of all our miseries.Try to sit silently for 20–30 mins in a day by focussing on breathing. (Silently here means thoughtless).By practice you will be able to stay in the present and there is always happiness in the present."
457,"I am cognizant of the fact after reading the top answers for this answer that every exceptional and great scene of The Dark Knight Trilogy and the comics and the games have been cited and voiced, so there's no point in answering from the Movie point of view, because people over here according to me have described a particular scene from the movie and then went on to conclude in a line as to how did it effect the world.Rather I want to take a Movie Vs Reality approach in my answer. I will take different aspects and characteristics of the Batman and Bruce Wayne (Which I can make out of after having seen the trilogy for at least 10+ times) which have been displayed to the audience by the creators and directors.So Coming right to it,(This list is not at at all exhaustive and can be decoded and improvised according to one's appetite)Responsibility: Bruce Wayne went on to become the silent protector because he sensed a feeling of responsibility towards his city which was shattered and consumed by atrocities and lawlessness which also took his away his loved parents from him. He didn't want that to happen with the other inhabitants of Gotham City.But in real life, who are we responsible towards? We are responsible towards our parents, our life-partners, children and ultimately oneself. If you are dirty rich, then you've an obligation towards the needy people. You don't need to wear a cape for that. Perseverance and Patience: Bruce Wayne and Batman both lost everything they once had. Bruce Wayne lost his parents, his love, his friends (After the Birthday debacle in Batman Begins), his wealth and everything else he had cherished, his own Palace of a home. Batman lost Harvey Dent, he lost all the people who were killed by Bane, he lost his physical power to Bane, and much more.But in reality, we are faced with unsatisfactory jobs, we lose our loved ones, we lose jobs, homes but not faced with the herculean task of a city. We can look up to Mr. Wayne and Batman is that Life is all be being Patient. Patience is the key to lead a happy and content life. All is never lost, until you perceive it to be lost. Someone can take your wealth, but not your patience, not your will power. So never ever be under a false impression that you've lost EVERYTHING. Sacrifice: Bruce Wayne and The Dark Knight sacrificed everything they had. Bruce sacrificed his wealth, models, and a billionaire life. The Dark Knight sacrificed his identity for protecting his near ones. He sacrificed his Life for his city (Well, technically he is dead now in Gotham, after the third installment)In your life, if there comes a moment where you have to sacrifice something, do not think twice about it. It is just for the greater good. You just don't know what good just yet. Nobody is asking you to live a life of a recluse. We need a bit of materialism in our lives, but when the times call for it, don't hold back. You're Sacrificing for a better Tomorrow. Health: In order to protect his city, the man in black armored suit had to be physically and mentally healthy. He had to fight 20 thugs at a time and then his fears were abused by Ra's Al Ghul, his mental health lacerated by the Joker, and was physically broken by Bane. But why do we fall Bruce? In reality, to be successful in work, relationship and life we need to be physically healthy and mentally free. We just cannot consume Junk, Alcohol and Cigarettes like addicts, well I accept all three help touch the taste buds gently but don't let it control you. Eat well, you do not need to have greens daily. Walk 10,000 steps, no need to run a marathon. Limit the rest to a monthly affair.  Right Vs. Wrong: Bruce  Wayne knew that by portraying himself as a squashed up billionaire was wrong, but in order for a greater good and for a importance purpose, it was correct. He had the awareness and the basic premise betwe..."

460,"Before I start answering this question, I would like to say that there’s no organization in this world (except a few) who doesn’t want to expand. Even a street vendor in India who rises to popularity wants to expand within the city and even beyond that. So, first and foremost thing that Spotify isn’t available in India is not because they don’t want to expand. They surely want to expand, not only in India but in almost all countries in the world. In fact, think about it yourself, why wouldn’t Spotify want to expand in India, being the second most populous country in the world?Moving on to the main part of the answer, there are several reasons why Spotify isn’t available in India. Music licensing is one such trouble and it’s legal equivalent of herding sheep in space. Launching in a new market involves thousands of hours of legalese and negotiations with many people spanning many companies, and there is also generally large upfront investments needed, often of several million dollars. Even with all that work, things will only be partially under their (Spotify) control - they will need others to allow them to have their music on the service - until they’ve managed to convince the major labels in a country like T-Series, Sony Music Company to name a few, they simply cannot launch.India is of course an important market that they want to be in, but it's also an enormous country and therefore the label landscape is also enormously complex.Adding to that, India is a country with very spotty internet connectivity, something they're not used to (something similar was quoted by Snapchat’s CEO on being questioned about expanding Snapchat in India), and which creates a technical hurdle on top of the legal complexities. Nothing is unsolvable, of course, they have awesome people for both the problems, but it's non-trivial and they're not here yet.Once Spotify arrives in India, lite version can be launched for people having slow internet connectivity but tackling legal actions with dominance of major labels will tend to be their prime concern. Until Spotify isn’t available in India, you can refer to Sahil Singh's answer to How do I use Spotify in India? and continue using Spotify on your desktop / laptop / smartphone.I almost forgot to mention one more thing. Though it’s not the reason why Spotify isn’t available in India but it might be one of the highlights of this topic. Piracy, yes, you heard it right. We, Indians (majority) are so used to piracy that we won’t ever pay for paid subscription which is the primary source of Spotify’s revenue. In near future, even if Spotify is made available in India, number of paid subscribers will be very less in comparison to FREE users. In India, piracy can be broadly divided into 2 categories:First category deals with things for which we feel guilty at some point of time. This category includes piracy of movies.From the above point, it’s obvious that this section contains things for which we don’t feel guilty at all and there’s no scope of feeling so in near future. It includes piracy of softwares (especially Microsoft Windows, Microsoft Office etc), Android applications, songs etc. I once asked a friend of mine if he wants to share my Apple Music subscription or not and he replied saying “gaane ke liye kaun pay karta hai bey” (Who the hell pays for songs?)NOTE: Some readers may feel offended after reading this but ask yourself whether I’m saying right or wrong. Also, I’m not pointing out everyone out there, there are people who are not indulged in piracy and they should be proud that they are supporting the creators by doing so. But the truth is that majority of us are indulged in piracy and most of them don’t even have an idea that it’s not legal and is a serious crime in itself.If you like my answer, kindly hit the upvote button and feel free to express your views in the comment section below.

463,"The quoted phrase “He who loves not abides in death” is taken from Bible. For understanding the meaning of messages in Bible you need to read it in the context.Love One Another (1 John 3: 11–15) “For this is the message that you have heard from the beginning, that we should love one another. We should not be like Cain, who was of the evil one and murdered his brother. And why did he murder him? Because his own deeds were evil and his brother’s righteous. Do not be surprised, brothers,c that the world hates you. We know that we have passed out of death into life, because we love the brothers. Whoever does not love abides in death. Everyone who hates his brother is a murderer, and you know that no murderer has eternal life abiding in him”.The message is clear, isn’t it? Even when there was only very few people on earth Cain thought of making everything for himself and killed his brother. It happened because he had no love for Abel, his brother.If you love a person and when he is getting praised for something you will be proud of him. You will feel proud for he is your friend.If the wife love husband she will be proud of him when husband gets acceptance in the society and appreciated by others. Because he belongs to her. But if wife do not love him she will be jealous and start hating him!Same is the case with all friends and family members. Love tolerates everything. Love take pride in everything.If you do not love your fellow beings there is no eternal bliss awaiting you."

It can reliably store data for many years.  As for the books, I believe the same: the books themselves aren't going to change that much, they're just about to change the media from paper to e-ink or whatever the future is. And printed books will follow the vinyl records: they will still be there for those of us who love to smell the freshly printed books, and for those who don't want to rely on their gadgets for reading.

468,"A2A,I've written about this before, but suffice to say that I have yet to find any evidence of Indian Mountaineering courses and institutes of providing anything other than techniques that were out of date in the 80s, and gear that is not suitable for mountaineering:What are some top institutes in India to get certified in mountaineering, skiing, rafting, kayaking, and paragliding?With that said this only matters if your goal is to learn how to bag peaks, and climb mountains independently. The majority of climbing in India focuses on the commercial climbing method, or siege style. They used aid climbing and fixed ropes to ascend all but the easiest terrain instead of technical skill and physical ability. So if you’re happy being a cog in a slightly unsafe machine, then Indian Mountaineering Instituites will provide you with excellent opportunities to help out other people on summits until you have risen up in the hierarchy.Here is why the course are terrible from the perspective of classical mountaineering and alpinism:Skills that critical to mountaineering (whiteout navigation, glacier travel, free climbing, proper rappel techniques) are absent, or undervalued on these courses in favour of fixed lines.Many of the techniques and equipment used on courses I have seen photographic evidence of are incredibly dangerous and would lead to serious legal consequences in other parts of the world.The fact this exists shows there is no oversight, or standards within Indian mountaineering. Instruction in safety techniques should ALWAYS have oversight from legitimate authorities. The lack of proper safety procedures reveals the whole system is brokenCalling this out led to outrage, and frustration towards myself, rather then the actually systems which were objectively incorrect according to every other international standard.I would strongly recommend against taking any course from anyone without IFMGA and UIAA accreditation. IFMGA and UIAA use scientific methods to test various techniques and practices. Nepal is the closest country with IFMGA certified guides: Nepal National Mountain Guides AssociationMajor skills are absent, or undervalued on these coursesThe courses do offer good comraderie, and a excellent chance to experience what a climbing expedition might look like in the Indian style.With that being said, I am biased by my western notions of mountaineering as a independent means of travel in hazardous environments that focus on small groups, onsight climbing and route finding, free climbing (gear and ropes, but ascent by purely physical rather than mechanical means), moving faster, and lighter.Mountaineering traditions in India were legitimate thirty years ago. Today they haven't evolved and are behind the rest of the world. The sole focus is on siege style methods, aid climbing, and “attacking” and “conquering” peaks with very large groups and any means necessary. Such style was rejected by European climbers in the fifties, though they kept the practice up in the Himalayas well into the 80s. Commercial expeditions too continue to follow this trend.But this style is rejected by guides, alpinists and mountaineers in the west, and southern America thanks to fancy lightweight gear, and leisure time to allow for skills and fitness training. there is also less social stigma for climberswho choose not to adhere to the norms of building families and careers. These options are not available to the average Indian, and to a certain extent one should make the best of what is available to them.But please review the answer I wrote. Some of the techniques taught have led to loss of life. I would highly recommend purchasing a UIAA recommended textbook like Mountaineering: The Freedom of the Hills, 8th Edition or Alpine Skills: Summer . Be critical of your instructors. Remember they are a self-certified organizations which means nothing. Trust these books over your instructors. These textbooks have been built on decades of learning from thousands of professionals using scientific methodology.Also, perhaps write to this program Arc'teryx Alpine Academy - Chamonix and tell them you are interested in bringing alpine style climbing to the growing market of Indian mountaineers. If you can convince Arc'teryx you could make money for them, perhaps they would sponsor you to go on the course."

Your parents , your wife and your kid . So at that point of time you cant say you are content and expect the other family members to be content too .In case of any medical emergency the hospitals will only entertain you if you have a bag full of money otherwise you may lose a loved one .Being satisfied is the perfect option only if there are no strings attached to you .So at this young age if you have a good job you are blessed . But see to it that you take it as blessing and continue to work hard . And do not let your laziness make you feel content . ;)A big storm is coming towards you and you should be prepared for it .Hope I am clear .

472,"Yes it’s just a theory.Just like the theory of Electromagnetism or the theory of Evolution. Bohr’s atomic model was just a theory which we don’t use now since we have a better theory- Quantum mechanical model of the atom. Until it is not falsifiable and can predict the future then it is correct else not.Newton’s gravitation was disproved a 100 years ago by Einstein’s relativity. After that we are still using Einstein’s relativity in our calculations which require precision, because Newton’ s theory isn’t completely wrong it is just a is generalization (or special case) of Relativity.The current theory of gravity breaks down at the quantum level and hence scientists worldwide are working on quantum gravity and when that theory will be found then we’ll have better theory. That’s how science works.I’m hoping that you are asked about the currently used theory of gravitation and not doubting the presence of a fundamental force-gravity itself. If former is the case then read on, if latter case then I’m sorry for you."
473,"The first thing you must understand is that there is much more to being a fighter pilot than looking cool and making women swoon. (Although those are certainly major bonuses when it comes to Naval Aviators)The job of a combat aviator is to be technically and tactically proficient with your aircraft in order to locate, close with, and destroy the enemy by delivering the weapons at your disposal.Basically killing bad guys by being smarter, quicker, better equipped and more lethal than they are.The training is long, tough intellectually, emotionally and physically. So tough that despite caliber of those selected, it can be the first time in their lives the student pilots face failure or tough criticism. It's humbling, yet extraordinarily rewarding.If you're a SJW, pansy, democrat, or any kind of liberal, “gender bender”, druggie, gun hater, or other sort of troublemaker, THIS IS NOT YOUR PLACE. While you may be physically capable of flying the jet, your mind works counter to the mission, and your presence is disruptive to your peers, making their job needlessly more difficult and risky to their lives.BE SURE YOU WANT TO BE HERE FOR THE RIGHT REASON.The act of flying the jet is an individual sport, it takes massive teamwork to get to that point. Thus, experience in such an environment helps. And it affects which service you choose to fly for.But back to the original question.Finish high school with high grades.DO NOT ENLIST. Pilots are Commissioned Officers with 4-year college degrees. While there are enlisted-to-officer programs, they are infrequent, highly competitive, and if you're in a critical MOS, you won't be allowed to leave until enlistment is up. GO TO COLLEGE.Start thinking about where to go to college early. If you want to go to Annapolis, West Point, Coast Guard, or Air Force, you better be working on it by your sophomore year. ROTC Scholarships, by Junior year. We will discuss service selection later.involved in extracurricular activities and/or sports.Be computer savvy. Hate to say it, but video games play a part in warfare today…Flight Simulator is goodStay fit. This is not a carnival ride. Fighting another jet or CAS when you're being shot at can be as brutal as a car crash.If you can afford it, get your private pilot's license. Learn the airspace, navigation, planning etc. Don't worry if you can't do this, because flying a cessna is so different than what you'll be doing, unless you've become truly proficient, it won't make much difference. The ground school, however, will.READ. Read news, history, biography, trade journals. Understand what you're heading for technically, historically, personally, and politically.Decide upon a college. If it's USNA, USMA, USCGA, USAFA, you're on autopilot for 4 years. Elsewhere, even if no scholarship, get involved in ROTC or the USMC OCC/PLC program immediately.Get a 4-year degree in something useful and technically oriented…biology, chemistry, computer science, engineering, geology, history(with technical electives), mathematics, physics, etc. NOTHING THAT ENDS IN “STUDIES”. While most any major is acceptable, these will make your journey easier because you simply must understand the dynamics of flight, weapons, and warfare.Get good grades in college. Be involved in previously mentioned commissioning programs. If they offer Aviation Guarantee, take it and don't screw it up.Accept your commission. Complete basic officer training. Go to flight school. Do well, and select your pipeline, then your jet.But what if you're a well-rounded, top achieving, high school graduate who has stayed away from the dark side of temptation, find yourself in college, taking the right courses, but are a “late decider”, not in ROTC or PLC/OCC, and want to fly?You can still do it.While I'd suggest applying to all 3 branches that fly fighters (and Coast Guard & Army if you'd fly bombers, transports or helos), consider what branch suits you best. Understand even in the other branches, you can end up a bomber, transport, or helo pilot too, if your grades are lower, or if you choose those routes.SERVICE SELECTIONFirst and foremost, the United States Marine Corps Naval Aviator is the epitome of fighter pilots and military men. Once out of jet flight school, you will fly F-35Bs, F-35Cs, F-18s, Harriers, or for a couple more years, Prowlers. You'll go to the boat and CQ (Carrier Qualify) like the Navy guys, but you'll also land the VTOL jets on amphibs, and operate from land bases. (Which makes your duty to the adoring women of the world somewhat more convenient). Do understand USMC life is more austere than the others, so the cameraderie with your fellow officers is critical. If you loved Fraternity life in College, this is a good fit. Remember, the entire USMC is in support of Troops on the Ground. You're a fighter pilot until you clear the airspace, then you're doing strike, attack, CAS, in support of the Marines on the ground. (Flying low and fast is more fun than flying high and fast anyway…) Being a Marine Corps Officer is truly different than all others. An honor and a privilege. And it's the branch least corrupted by political correctness. If you want to be at the tip of the spear, this is where you want to be.A close second are our brothers and peers in the US NAVY. Both USMC and USN go through the exact same training. They fly pretty much the same jets…but no VTOL…although the mission is different. It's carrier-centric, and you deploy at sea for 6 months at a time. Still, Navy and Marines interoperate seamlessly all the time. Navy life is similar to USMC for junior officers, but later on the Navy is more “buttoned down” and less tolerant of eccentricities. Sadly, political correctness has all but destroyed the “Top Gun” ethos in any way visible to the public. But Naval Aviation remains an incredible place for men of honor, skill, confidence and action. (Even if they aren't Marine Officers)The USAF. Yep, they have the F-22. They have F-35As. They have F-15A/C/Ds, They have F-16s. But since all students take the same syllabus, unless you are at the top, there's a LOT of seats to fill in B-52s, KC-135s, KC-10s, C-5s, C-17s, etc. Great if your goal is to be an airline pilot in 10 years. Sucks if you want to be a fighter pilot. The USAF is the branch most deeply corrupted by political correctness. Much of this is because the USAF has the fewest combatants in proportion to the overall size of the service, the lowest overall physical standards, and the fewest leaders who have actually faced enemy action. This breeds a ”corporate” culture where inferior individuals brown-nose their way into positions of authority while their braver, stronger, smarter, more honorable peers are off in harm’s way with the Marines, Navy and Army. While this crap is fine in a hippie commune, it's absolutely toxic to a military organization. Certainly, the USAF Fighter Wings and Squadrons, because of the type of man who is capable of becoming a fighter pilot, have a lifestyle approaching that of the USMC and USN, but they can't land on Aircraft Carriers, and women will always seek out the Naval Aviators first. Admittedly, the USAF lifestyle is the most comfortable. Their base facilities rival Club Med. Even deployed, comfort comes first. Where the Marines and Army dig a trench to give birth to a liberal, the USAF has air-conditioned tents with running water and flush toilets. Where the USMC slept on cots in tents on the muddy airfield in Aviano, Italy, the USAF aircrew were coddled in luxury chalets and hotels in the mountains, shuttled back and forth in helicopters like Russian oligarchs.All joking aside, we're all on the same team. Regardless of the branch, American aviators are the best in the world.There are differences between the branches. Figure out what suits you best.Understand that to become a fighter pilot…USMC, USN, or USAF… you must be one of the best. Tens of thousands dream of doing it, but only a couple hundred guys a year actually make it. You're going to end up in a very exclusive club, and the work is just beginning when you earn your wings.To summarize:Prepare. Morally, mentally, physically.Graduate HS. Top grades, activities.Follow commissioning path through college.Excel in flight school.Fly fighters."

475,"First, a theory can be “proven” beyond a reasonable doubt. Any doubt the theory “the earth is round” has been proven?Second, there are a considerable number of observations that species of Homo lived in caves in southern Europe and the Mideast. There are remnants of fires, stone tools, flakes from when the stone tools were being made, bones of large animals broken open to get at the marrow, paintings in caves, etc. All these indicate that Homo sapiens (us) and Homo neanderthals lived in these caves.There is also evidence that some caverns within caves were used as burial sites, particularly an example in Spain and H. naledi fossils in South Africa."
476,"Can the climate change be reversed?This question is almost the same as:Are the Climate change effects we experience reversible?The climate will be changing in a number of ways, some maybe be reversible, others not.One change that appears to be approaching quite quickly is melting permafrost in the Artic regions. This will be an irreversible tipping point as there is a massive quantity of carbon stored within the permafrost, biological matter that has been trapped by snow that turns into ice, and clath-hydrates. As the permafrost melts then this matter is then released, and degrades into methane, a greenhouse gas that is around 86 times stronger than carbon dioxide, once released this carbon matter cannot be recaptured so would therefore lock in substantially higher temperatures as there are estimates that the Arctic carbon is of the order of 11 years worth of human emissions. There is also significant carbon stored in the seabed in the form of methane clathrate or hydrates, although the mechanism around this form of methane is poorly understood, possibly implicit in 6C warming during the end-Permian extinction:Clathrate gun hypothesis - WikipediaThe IPCC has given us 12 years which suggests considering irreversible climate tipping points.It is therefore expedient to consider the risks, there are substantial risks in allowing Climate Change to progress, therefore it would be prudent to address Climate Change mitigation. A key part of mitigating Climate Change is the reduction of fossil fuel combustion, a point that will come at some stage as there is not an infinite supply of fossil fuels, so by bringing forward the move to carbon free energy we are reducing the risks, and massively reducing the wide range of pollution and it’s consequent health issues becoming pressing in many large cities. From an economic standpoint, renewable energy resources are falling below carbon in generation costs, suggesting economic benefit from migrating away from carbon based energy sources."

I've literally written down ""Can I have your number?"" on a piece of paper and slid it over to my crush at the time and got her number. I've still got that piece of paper years and years later. You might think you need to make some kind of punch line or charm her into giving you her number but that is not the case. It's a very simple yes or no procedure and my Godbrother always advised talking as least as possible prior to getting the number, because you can talk a lot after you get the number. A simple compliment about a specific characteristic or specific part of her appearance (i.e. You're funny or You have beautiful eyes) and then go ahead and tell her you want to get to know her better and then ask for her number. If you get the number, thank her and then tell her you'll call her later and then disappear. You've been successful and there's no need to mess a good thing up so disappear and prepare yourself for the call you're going to make later. In the case that she doesn't want to give out her number, apologize for wasting her time and be off. Understand she has the choice to reject your approach and take it like a man. Don't have a temper tantrum like you're 4 years old. Let that fantasy go and keep it moving. "

479,"Amongst all the Indian scriptures, Ramayana and Mahabharata are known as “Itihasa” meaning Iti- This ha – like this sah – happened. Amongst all the versions of Ramayana, Valmiki Ramayana is the oldest and the authentic version. Mahabharata is composed by Vyasa Maharshi and fortunately, there are no other versions. These two works are called epics – Itihasas and they are more like journals. They contain a record of events as described and nothing else. The beauty and greatness of the authors lies in using poetic language and exemplary descriptions in whatever small portions they could get their hands on. But just for the use of poetic language, these scriptures are mistaken as nothing but poetic works instead of historic journals.So yes, Ramayana and Mahabharata did happen really and as described.If you consider the timeline of these two events, Ramayana happened at least 8,80,000 years ago (5,000 odd years of Kaliyuga + 8,64,000 years for Dwapara Yuga + 11,000 years of rule by Lord Rama in Treta Yuga). Just because of the duration, it is very difficult to obtain a large amount of evidences as very few can survive the onslaught of nature and many of the places will be and have been modified, relocated, renamed and/or destroyed by the later generation Kings.Coming to Mahabharata, the same happened and very few places and artifacts survived for 5,000 years, most of them were damaged or disfigured. But Mahabharata is closer to the present time and hence compared to Ramayana, we can find many evidences of Mahabharata although many aspects suffered the same fate as those of Ramayana.Just because Ramayana and Mahabharata are real and are associated with Lord Rama and Krishna respectively, many people have later tried to relate some places and incidents with them falsely. We need to study the actual scriptures to verify their authenticity and preserve our culture and the tradition instead of blindly believing everything or rejecting everything.Records of Bharat dynasties and real historical lineageIt is mentioned in Aadiparva, the book of the beginning. Which is the first of eighteen books of the Mahabharata, chapter 62 about the records of the Bharat-Dynasty (interestingly the name of India ‘Bharat’ has the origin from it), and its lineage are recorded .More than 50 kings and their dynasties starting from king Manu have been presented in detail. A fictional tale as we know would hardly use 5-6 of them.Bharat plays with lion cubsIt is written as Itihas (History)In Mahabharata it is clearly written that it is a “Itihas’ (Sanskrit word for History). The words “Puraan” and “Itihas” were specifically coined by the ancient people to categorize the “ancient” and “recent” events. Both the words denote history that has occurred at different times. If the intention of the writer was to write a poem or a work of fiction, he would have stated it to be a “Mahakavya” (epic) or “Katha” (story) which was a tradition at that time.Description of modern world in ancient timesRead the description of Kaliyuga as mentioned in Mahabharata. Whatever Krishna predicted about future civilization in Kalyug (Modern Times) came true, but please note that these were not prophecies but are the part of Geeta. And remember – this was written thousands of years ago! Fiction? Unlikely because there are way too many corroborations and tallying circumstances for it to be fiction.Archaeological evidence of the lost city of DwarkaDwarka Submerged cityMarine archaeology while exploring the ancient submerged city of Dwaraka in Gujarat, uncovered further evidences in support of statements in the Vedic scriptures. An entire submerged city at Dwaraka, the ancient port city of Lord Krishna with its massive fort walls, piers, warfs and jetty has been found in the ocean as described in the Mahabharata and other Vedic literature.Real places mentioned in Mahabharata and archaeologi..."
480,"As has been stated earlier the War Powers Act of 1973 puts limits on the POTUS for prolonged military conflict. This was a direct response to our involvement in Viet Nam. However, because Congress is mostly made up of useless meatbags, they have never used this authority. Congress issues an Authorization to Use Military Force (AUMF) when POTUS asks for their assent to his actions. This is supposed to lay out the objective and parameters to prosecute the conflict.We are still using the most recent AUMF passed in 2003 to justify actions in Libya, Iraq, Syria, Yemen. The list goes on. President Obama inherited this AUMF which is written so broadly so as to justify virtually anything. Sacks of Potatoes (Congress) was urging (whining at) POTUS to change strategy in the Global War on Terror. POTUS then asked for an updated AUMF in order to comply with the wishes of Smart as a Bag of Hammers (Congress).Unsurprisingly, Useless as screen doors on Submarines (Congress) was unable to create a new AUMF that satisfied their demands. Their demands were essentially “do what you’re doing but do it different and better.” POTUS nodded and backed away slowly so as not to induce a seizure in tits on a bull (Congress)So yes they have the power. They are just afraid to use it.I hope insulting Congress (scratch-spit) is not a violation of BNBR. I apologize to any meatbags, potatoes, hammers, screen doors or bulls I may have offended."
481,"Hi, last I heard, which admittedly was quite awhile ago, was that the most you could supposedly safely lose was ~2.5lbs/week. A solid diet, with proper portion control and some exercise will be your friend. (so they say)I was actually diagnosed with diabetes this past Feb. I was introduced to a book called Smart Blood Sugar (best $27 I ever spent!), by Marlene Merritt out of Austin, TX. She’s an MSN nutritionist, as well as, licensed by the State of Texas as a Dr. of Chinese Medicine. The book is really more of a booklet, than a whole book, as it’s less than 60 pages long and maybe 8″ tall x 5 1/2 - 6″ wide. At any rate, she teaches in the book that if you eat 60 grams/day or less your blood sugar will stay with in normal ranges and you will almost certainly not develop diabetes. However, if you HAVE diabetes, by eating the way she recommends in the book, (which I do) almost anyone can get their Type II Diabetes under control and most will not have to take medicine (ie: metformin and/or insulin) to control it. The day I was diagnosed, my A1C was 10.8% and my blood sugar was 385. I immediately started eating the way she describes in her book and in 1 1/2 months my blood sugar was back into normal range, at 3 months, my A1C was down to 6.2%. Now, in Aug., I’ve been eating this way since the first part of March 2016, and I’ve lost 28 or 29 lbs. Carbs are NOT your friend! Try checking out the provided link. You DON’T have to have diabetes to eat healthy. And eating healthy is REALLY what this book is about! Lose the carbs . . . lose the weight! :-) hope this helps!"

483,"The real reason in the USA that Police use Red and Blue is convention. Blue generally represents Law Enforcement and Red lights are for Emergency Use only by law. A person can’t by law, put flashing red or blue lights on their personal vehicle for this reason. This is why you see yellow (the next most visible color) on Tow Trucks etc, or anyone who has a vehicle for business etc that needs extra visibility in traffic.The wavelengths of the colors etc were not taken into consideration when deciding what colors to use..just convention and tradition. There are different local conventions as well. For example for years the Michigan State Police only used 1 solitary Red light on all of their police vehicles. They still have the one red light but it is supplemented with additional light bars for safety today. Where I was a Fireman in Edwardsville Illinois the Fire used Red and white and the Police used Blue and White light bars."

485,"Very interesting question. Don’t know that I have the answer. Actually, I’m sure I don’t have the answer. That’s one of those questions that even if you got the correct answer, you wouldn’t know if that really was it or not. So, maybe it doesn’t even pay to ask some questions, unless it’s simply for mind stimulation instead of an actual answer. Part of me says we all own nature. We basically control that little space, that little part of nature that surrounds us at any given moment. We have opportunities to enjoy it at every turn. If we have the freedom to do that, then it really doesn’t matter who owns it, unless you’d just like to know so you could thank them for allowing you to experience it. Legally, I reckon recognized land owners own and control the nature on their property, to the extent, of course, that it doesn’t interfere with someone else’s property. But there’s enough public lands that are available to the general public for anyone to enjoy a lifetime of nature, if they so chose. Maybe no one owns it. Some people just assume control of it and pay the fee to use it to whom ever claims to own it in the first place. Most land was stolen at least once somewhere back in time, so that throws a whole other wrench in your monkey. We own nature. All of us, together as one living organism. Every breath everyone of us takes gets blown out into the same air that we all breath. The trees of nature sucks up all our breaths and filters it, pumping it back out for us to breathe anew, with every breath. We are one living being and whatever happens to the least of us happens to all of us. A healthy us makes a healthy nature. Nature is for all of us, unless one is imprisoned or suffocated and kept apart from nature, then they have their own nature and they own it. You own your own nature and you are responsible for it. Just make sure you enjoy your share and make sure you go vote."

487,"Good question. When you say variables declared insude the main() function, these are local variables. They are destroyed when the function finishes it execution. All local variables are stored in the stack. I hope you know what a stack is. Before a function begins execution, details like function arguments, return address, local variables, etc is pushed onto the stack. When the function finishes execution, its popped off the stack.Let's consider 3 functions f1, f2 and f3. First f1 gets called, and is pushed onto the stack. Now f1 calls f2, and f2 is pushed onto the stack. The stack now contains f2 and f1. After f2 finishes its execution, its popped off the stack. Now f1 calls f3, and f3 is pushed onto the stack. The stack now contains f3 and f1. But f3 is stored in the exact location of where f2 was stored earlier. Since the memory is not cleared before pushing f3, we get what we call ""garbage value"", which is actually the data used for f2.The varibales that are declared outside with global scope and not initialized are stored in BSS segment (.bss). The variables stored in BSS are reset to 0. This is actually an optimization done by the compiler to save memory. These variables can simply be mapped to the zero page, and hence do not need to be stored in the binary. These variables shall be allocated space at run time by the loader, just before the variables are used.Thus its mentioned in the C standard. All static and global variables must be initialized before the program starts. If the  programmer didn't do this explicitly, then the compiler must set them to  zero. If the compiler doesn't do this, it doesn't follow standard C."

490,"A2AThe reason why noon is neither a.m. nor p.m. has to do with the meaning of these two abbreviations. The abbreviations “a.m.” and “p.m.” are short for the Latin terms “ante meridiem” and “post meridiem.” These terms literally mean before noon and after noon. For example,I ate breakfast at 9:00 a.m. (before noon)I got home from work at 6:00 p.m. (after noon)This is why “noon” can neither be a.m. nor p.m. because “noon” cannot be “after” or “before” itself. You can, however, express noon by saying 12:00 m. (meridies), but very few people use this form and it may even add to the confusionIt is always better to use the 24-hour clock, when 12:00 is 12 noon and, for example, 24:00 Sunday or 00:00 Monday both mean 12 midnight Sunday/Monday. It is common in transport timetables to use 23:59 Sunday or 00:01 Monday (in this example), or 11:59 p.m. or 12:01 a.m., to furtherThings to keep in mindNoon is neither a.m. nor p.m.Midnight is a part of the day that is ending, not the day that is beginning.When expressing times for “noon” and “midnight” it is best not to use numerals (12:00 a.m. and 12:00 p.m.).Avoid the redundant 12:00 noon and 12:00 midnight."
491,"Asteroids and comets have a few things in common. They are both celestial bodies orbiting our Sun, and they both can have unusual orbits, sometimes straying close to Earth or the other planets. They are both “leftovers” — made from materials from the formation of our Solar System 4.5 billion years ago. But there are a few notable differences between these two objects, as well.The main difference between asteroids and comets is their composition, as in, what they are made of. Asteroids are made up of metals and rocky material, while comets are made up of ice, dust and rocky material. Asteroids formed much closer to the Sun, where it was too warm for ices to remain solid. Comets formed farther from the Sun where ices would not melt. Comets which approach the Sun lose material with each orbit because some of their ice melts and vaporizes to form a tail.Right now, the majority of asteroids reside in the asteroid belt, a region between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter which may hold millions of space rocks of varying sizes.On the other hand, the majority of comets are in the farthest reaches of our Solar System: either 1. in the Kuiper Belt — a region just outside the orbit of the dwarf planet Pluto that may have millions of icy comets (as well as many icy dwarf planets like Pluto and Eris); or 2. the Oort Cloud, a region where trillions of comets may circle the Sun at huge distances of up to 20 trillion kilometers (13 trillion miles).The Kuiper BeltThe Oort Cloud."

498,"Can hair structure change?Yes, hair structure can be changed with chemical texture services which cause a chemical change.Image of the Parts Of Human Hair - Henry Gray (1918) Anatomy of the Human Body - Bartleby.com: Gray's Anatomy, Plate 945The chemical change permanently alters the natural wave pattern of the hair, until the hair grows back at the root.Chemical hair services can be used to retexturize curl as well as add volume to straight hair. It can also straighten overly curly hair, or soften coarse, straight hair.Chemical texture services applied to the hair can make it much more pliable and easier to style.Texture hair services include, but aren’t necessarily limited to the following:permanent waving (known as perms)chemical straightening (removing all texture)soft curl perms (adding soft curls to straight hair)curl re-forming (restructuring natural curls)chemical hair relaxing (softening natural texture)All hair texture services are constantly being improved by new discoveries, and advancements.Each distinct chemical texture service may use different chemical formulations. They also may have different objectives or a different list of steps and/or procedures.All texture services involve chemical and physical changes within the structure of the hair.Hair And How Chemicals Can Change The Hair’s StructureThe major layers of the hair, starting from the outside working inward include:The Cuticle - This is the tough outer layer of hair which surrounds the inner layers and protects hair from damage.If someone has a strong compact cuticle layer, it makes the hair more resistant. This basically means that the hair resists penetration, When hair is persistent, it is more difficult to treat and service.The cuticle is not directly involved in chemical texture services. However, the chemicals must be able to penetrate through the cuticle in order to be effective.Chemical hair texturizers offer the ability to change the hair’s natural curl pattern.Alkaline chemical solutions soften and swell the hair, raising the cuticle and thereby permitting the solution to penetrate through the cuticle to its target within the cortex.Coarse, resistant hair with a strong compact cuticle layer requires a texturizer which is highly alkaline (high pH). a less alkaline (lower pH) solution is more suited to porous, damaged, or chemically treated hair.The CortexThe middle layer of the hair located directly beneath the cuticle is known as the cortex.The polypeptide chains of the cortex are connected by end bonds and cross-linked by side bonds which form the fibers and structure of hair.These chemical bonds hold the hair in its natural wave pattern and are responsible for the incredible strength and elasticity of human hair.Breaking the side-bands of the cortex makes it possible to change the natural wave pattern of the hair.Peptide Bonds (End Bonds)The chemical bonds which join the amino acids are called peptide bonds or end bonds.Peptide ChainsThe peptide bonds, in turn, link together to form long chains of amino acids called polypeptide chains.Proteins are long, coiled complex polypeptide chains made of different amino acids linked together, end to end, like an old-fashioned pop bead chain.It’s important to note that peptide bonds should not be broken during any salon service.Breaking the peptide bonds in the hair causes the polypeptide chains to come apart and dramatically weakens the hair.If used incorrectly, chemical hair texturizers can break peptide bonds and cause major hair breakage.Chemical hair texturizers must be used with care.Side BondsThe cortex is made of millions of polypeptide chains cross-lined by three types of side bonds of cross bonds:disulfide bondssalt bondshydrogen bondsDisulfide BondsThe chemical and physical changes in disulfide bonds make permanent waving, soft curl permanents (curl re-forming) and chemical hair relaxing pos..."

500,"Men are usually more straight forward, than women. If a guy says he likes you, he most likely does. If you want to know if he likes you more for your body, or your soul, you can usually tell by where he looks when he is talking to you. The more he looks you in the eyes when he is talking to you, the more he likes you for your soul. The more he likes you for your body, the more he'll look at your boobs when he's talking to you. Despite most women's insistence that romance is everything, in my experience, there has to be a cirtian amount of carnal attraction, to keep a spark for any length of time. I'd say a healthy ammount of him looking at your boobs, would be 1/4 to 1/3 of the time. If he looks at your boobs more than that, he doesn't respect you as much as he wants to ravish you. If he looks at your boobs less than that, his sex drive is probably low."
501,"The skill of being able to see and live day in the life of someone else.Given all the massively technical answers on parade, I have to disagree with the mass majority of them.Most things today are written for you. Just include the library.Good at algorithms? Okay. Make something to add to the already discovered heap of algorithms.Not sure about syntax? Consult google, stack overflow, etc. The world is now an open book test. You don’t need to memorize anything anymore.Solving problems are mostly just a matter of time. Yes, some solve it faster, some slower, but computation is this: scale. Once you solve it — machine time out scales any kind of human time you invested.The measure that separates a good programmer from a poor programmer is this:Can you multiply and enable someone else to be more, do more, and achieve more than without you?The average programmer gets stuck in a tunnel that focuses on their ability complete assignments given to them. This is how they were taught. Given a homework assignment, complete it early and you can relax — enjoy yourself. “You earned it.” Day after day, university, college, or boot camp, they were given a list to complete and they showed their vocational ability to check off the task. Complete it. Move on.However, the best programmers go beyond the assignment. Go beyond checking things as done. Go beyond doing it quickly. Go beyond.The best programmers can live a day in the life of their users. The people they are servicing. They can do the work, use the interface, and attempt to be proficiently productive while using the software.The best programmers are given requirements and they ask… why? Average programmers are given requirements and they jump directly into implementation. A kind of muscle memory from months and years of programming education.An amazing programmer will take “requirements”, think about them, shadow the users, do it themselves, and apply everything they have learned while living a day in the life of someone else and ask:What am I really trying to solve?How effective are the requirements I am given?How can I add or change the requirements to be even more effective?Who gave me these requirements, maybe they are not accurate?How do I get accurate requirements?What’s the real improvement goals, is it measurable? Specific?The fact is, everyone has perspectives based on their own views of the problem. Programmers will look at it differently. Users will too. Even managers. If we blindly accept requirements, then we are putting trust into those ideas. If we do not mentally simulate and even physically simulate, than we might not get the whole story.A massively great skill to have as a programmer, is to be willing and able to live a day of the life of someone else… to know their hardships, their inefficiencies, their annoyances, and their real issues. This skill gives programmers the ability to do more, be more, and excellerate faster."
502,"Seeing as how the United States still spends more money on its defence than the next eight countries combined probably never, or at least not for a few decades.Caveat - I do realise that Britain’s defence expenditure was significantly larger than Germany’s in the lead up to WWIWhich brings me to my main point, it could happen by accident but would require a major miscalculation on the part of the Americans, Russians and/or Chinese. Unfortunately, that potential does exist in several theatres, but thankfully in each it is still unlikely.Potential flashpoints -Korea -This is the most obvious and disconcerting, the two countries are officially still at war, do not recognise each other’s existence and the North has long had a diplomatic policy predicated on sabre-rattling and extortion. Add to that the fact that they are historically allies with the People’s Republic of China (the world’s fastest emerging power). The Chinese “communists” of course do not particularly like the North Korean regime, but they like the idea of North Korea becoming a vacuum or US troops near the Chinese border even less, ergo they have a vested interest in protecting their annoying neighbour.The entire reason why the North Koreans developed nuclear weapons was to avoid the fate of Saddam Hussein or Muammar al Gaddafi, the latter of which voluntarily abandoned his nuclear weapons programme; however, by developing intercontinental ballistic missiles, Pyongyang has fundamentally altered the equation. Both Bush and Obama were willing at least de facto/temporarily to tolerate a North Korea that in theory could nuke South Korea or Japan, but no US President (not even a hypothetical President Bernie Sanders) could likely tolerate a North Korea that was capable of destroying a US city at its own discretion, even though it is still just a deterrent. Kim Jong-un has taken a reckless but rational foreign policy objective and made it even more reckless.War between the United States and North Korea is still avoidable but unfortunately not entirely unlikely. It could go either way at this point. Even without Chinese intervention, a second Korean War would be a horrifyingly bloody affair (I heard one projection the other day of 1 million casualties in year one, and that’s with a conventional war in which no nukes are used). However, with Chinese intervention, you would get WWIII. While Pyongyang appears willing to risk war, thankfully cooler heads exist in Beijing and even Washington.Militarily, North Korea is a funny country to put it mildly. They are constantly attempting to project power despite having ageing equipment and a sparse budget. However, the sheer size of the Korean People’s Army and their unconventional weapons (nukes and chemical weapons) are nothing to dismiss. The “Democratic People’s Republic of Korea” is an extremely poor country, but they do put their meagre resources to use.SyriaHere too, there is cause for concern but thankfully both Washington and Moscow are aware of it. Alongside the previous conflicts in the DRC and Sudan, the Syrian Civil War is one of the greatest human tragedies of our lifetimes. An attempted revolution, inspired by the Arab Spring, has descended into a multifaceted quagmire of a conflict with growing international implications. This situation is extremely chaotic and has too many moving parts for me to cover in one paragraph. Suffice it to say that the militaries of the Russian Federation, Islamic Republic of Iran, United States of America, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and other rivals are all active in the same theatre of conflict with different and often contradictory agendas. One doesn’t have to be a rocket scientist to appreciate why there is cause for concern.Thanks to Ukraine Russo-American ties have become considerably worse, while the tensions between the Iranians and Saudis are also important (essentially the two cou..."

504,"Seeking asylum is a specific process to get protection from individual persecution. Asylum seekers should apply for asylum in the first safe country — not think about what the “best” country for asylum is.The top answer of the question is a good example for what’s wrong with the perception of asylum. “My favorite [country for asylum seekers] is Sweden”. As asylum seekers are a burden to the host country (at least financially), this logic basically punishes countries who are open and hospitable for asylum seekers by “recommending” it for additional asylum seekers.This way of speaking about asylum ultimately is bad for asylum seekers in the long-term, because it softens up the originally very specific definitions of seeking asylum (from individual persecution) or seeking refuge (from hopefully temporary turmoil from natural catastrophes or war).For example, in Germany just 1% of the applicants for asylum are granted asylum. The others are either former refugees (e.g. from Syria or Iraq) or just economic migrants who try to use the asylum process to get residence in a rich European country.A person who is individually persecuted should try to get to a safe country with a stable asylum process. The first such country they enter, they should apply for asylum.A refugee from civil war should seek the next safe shelter. In the case of Syria, this would have been refugee camps in Lebanon, Turkey or Jordan. The living conditions in these camps are not ideal (and should be improved by rich countries), but if you then decide to migrate from these camps to another country, you’re not a refugee anymore. If you cross Turkey, Greece, Austria to get to Germany, you’re not a refugee. Any of these places have been safe.An economic migrant should use legal processes to apply for migration. Which will often be impossible for uneducated migrants from poor countries. Then still coming to Europe and “apply for asylum” is basically abusing the system. They know that in practice, many economic migrants are either not identified as such, or even if they are, they are not sent home for a plethora of reasons. But still, they’re abusing a system designed to help individually persecuted people, and thus reducing the long-term sustainability of this system.Now, of course the motivations of economic migrants, or Syrian refugees in the safety of Turkey, to move on to a rich European country, are understandable. Possibly, I’d try the same if it were made easy to me. But I believe it should be clearly dis-incentivized, so that less economic migrants or former refugees take dangerous and illegal measures to improve their living conditions."
505,"‘How often have I said to you that when you have eliminated the impossible, whatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth?’ (Sherlock Holmes)In this case though he would want to prove the “guilty” to be innocent: It’s so easy to wait for an uncommon event to rev up the spotlights of attention and then step forward and bask in the limelight. And because these events are a little more uncommon than even the media cares for, they eagerly and uncritically jump to the first relief coming their way: a normal human being taking responsibility. Great, we can go back to sleep! But Sherlock isn’t that easily satisfied with shallow claims.This mandala appeared 1990 carved in the hard bottom of a desert lake in Oregon and comprised a total of 13 miles of 10″ wide furrows dug 3″deep. Lieutenant Bill Miller of the 190th Tactical Reconnaissance Squadron reported the details of what he had spotted to the authorities at the Air National Guard - “a 13.3 mile glyph of lines about a quarter of a mile square, on the extremely hard, sun-baked dry bed of a lake in Mickey Basin…” These pilots are trained to spot the unusual on a much smaller scale than that and there is no chance they could have missed the ongoing construction of such an image during their regular rounds.Now, here’s the recent account of a then 12 year old who claims to have camped out there for couple weeks helping his dad and a friend creating this perfectly executed pattern. Oregon Land Art (Sri Yantra)“It was really hard work because we didn't use any machines or special surveying equipment.” The challenge wouldn’t be the hard work, it’s the precision layout without compass and ruler and without leaving auxiliary construction lines.“…we had to draw some pretty big lines!” he states, and thus blows his cover: he used the wrong words, the right ones being “dig” and “furrow”, but these words wold immediately solicit the thorny follow-up question: “were did the dug up material go?”“We kept the project anonymous and left no traces of us having been there.” he writes, completely ignoring the fact that 13miles worth of furrows 10″by 3″ will leave you with 400 cubic meters of debris, which means moving and making disappear 600t of desert material. Now, I’ve helped my dad dig a lot of tree pits - in comparatively soft soil - so I have a good, hands on appreciation of what it means to manually move cubic meters of material. They would have collapsed with broken backs not half way into this.“It was really accurate too because small errors are smoothed out as a result of the large scale involved…” Another sign that this guy doesn’t know at all what he’s talking about: Inaccuracies in the underlying geometry and proportionality of any structure will reveal themselves more clearly at a distance. That’s why artists always step back from their canvas to make sure they get it right.Perfectly straight and parallel lines in perfect orthogonality without a guide, perfectly identical ogee shaped curves without a template? Just by walking and pulling a crude plow through hardened mud? It would be a major logistics project with tons of preparation and high tech equipment to pull that off. Yet it is claimed to be the result of a family outing entertainment with only the crudest of tools. Whom are they kidding?It’s amazing how easy it is to hoax the hoaxing, how much nonsense the brain can produce and accept without short circuiting itself.Take Bower and Chorley for instance, who claimed responsibility for most crop circles in England from the mid 70ies to the early 90ies. They claim to have produced, in nightly excursions, intricate geometric patterns with ropes, a simple board and that silly contraption on their cap which is supposed to help them follow a straight line - how exactly? and in the dark of the night when most crop circles appeared?The problem with crop circles in fields is the l..."
506,"No. You cleanse methamphetamine (and all other drugs) from your system through enzyme-catalyst reactions at a rate predetermined by your own genetic code. This is commonly referred to as metabolism. There is no scientific, peer-reviewed evidence that suggests there is anything you can ingest to speed this process up, although there is some evidence to suggest that amino acids such as creatine can increase your body's ability to produce more energy for work. Most drug tests do not test for drugs themselves, as they are eliminated rapidly from your blood. Instead, they use antibodies to detect drug metabolites, which are the substances your body breaks the drugs down into. This is why urine drug tests (udt) are the most prevalent among the various testing methods. The metabolites are filtered and stored in the kidneys, and then excreted in the urine. UDTs, therefore,  have reasonably long detection times, yet still avoid the expense involved in hair follicle testing (which increases detection times even further).  Blood testing would tell someone what you might be high on at the moment of the test, but urine testing gives an inquisitor a glimpse into your recent past.If you have a UDT coming up and you fear you will not be clean, your best bet is to drink plenty of water, and exercise to increase your metabolism. A couple of hours before your test, drink enough water so that your urine is clear and very frequent. B complex vitamins will help color it back yellow, and a few table spoons of common table salt may help increase specific gravity in case your sample is sent to a lab for a validity check.  Dilution is the solution to pollution, and a diluted sample is always better than a failure."
507,"Zika Virus (ZIKV) is mosquito-borne emerging flavivirus which was first identified in Zika Forest of Uganda in 1947 in rhesus monkeys. It was later identified in humans in 1968 for the first time in Nigeria. Different outbreaks of Zika virus disease have been recorded in Africa, the Americas, Asia and the Pacific. Its infection is caused by the bite of an infected Aedes mosquito, usually causing mild fever, rash, conjunctivitis, and muscle pain. In Brazil in May 2015, the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) issued an alert regarding the first confirmed Zika virus infections.Group: Group IV ((+) ssRNA)Family: FlaviviridaeGenus: FlavivirusSpecies: Zika virusStructure of Zika Virus :-The virion is approximately 40 nm in diameter with surface projections that measure roughly 5-10 nm.Nucleocapsid is 25-30 nm in diameter surrounded by a host-membrane derived lipid bilayer.EnvelopedIcosahedralContains envelope proteins E and MGenome of Zika virus :-Non-segmented, single-stranded, positive-sense RNA genome10794 bases long with two non-coding regions flanking regions known as the 5′ NCR and the 3′ NCR.Sign and Symptoms of Zika Virus :-These symptoms are mild and usually last for 2-7 days.HeadacheFeverSkin rashes (exanthema)Pink eyeConjunctivitisMuscle and joint painMalaiseSymptoms are similar to that of dengue or chikungunya.Epidemiology of Zika virus :-The virus was first isolated in 1947 from a rhesus macaque in the Zika Forest of Uganda.It was later identified in humans in 1968 for the first time in NigeriaThe first major outbreak, with 185 confirmed cases, was reported in 2007 in the Yap Islands.The first cases confirmed in Brazil was in May 2015 and the country is currently experiencing the largest epidemic ever recorded with 440,000 to 1,300,000 suspected cases reported by the Brazilian health authorities.There are 3174 cases and 38 deaths from microcephaly in Brazil as of 21 October 2015.There has been total death of 152 as of 21 October 2015 in the world.Affected Countries: Barbados, Bolivia, Brazil, Colombia, the Dominican Republic, Ecuador, El Salvador, French Guiana, Guatemala, Guadeloupe, Guyana, Haiti, Honduras, Martinique, Mexico, Panama, Paraguay, Puerto Rico, Saint Martin, Suriname, and Venezuela.Countries and territories with active Zika virus transmission as of Jan 2016.Source: CDCSince November, Brazil has seen nearly 4,000 cases of microcephaly in babies born to women who were infected with Zika during their pregnancies.Transmission of Zika virus :-Zika virus is transmitted from one people to another through the bite of an infected Aedes mosquito, mainly Aedes aegypti in tropical regions.There has been one report of possible spread of the virus through blood transfusion and one report of possible spread of the virus through sexual contact.In 2015, Zika virus RNA was detected in the amniotic fluid of two fetuses, indicating that it had crossed the placenta and could cause a mother-to-child infection.The Asian tiger mosquito, Aedes albopictus, is also known to transmit the virus, but it is not clear how efficiently.To date, there are no reports of infants getting Zika virus through breastfeeding.Pathogenesis of Zika Virus :-Incubation period in mosquitoes is about 10 days.The vertebrate hosts of the virus are primarily monkeys and humans.The pathogenesis of the virus is hypothesized to start with an infection of dendritic cells near the site of inoculation, followed by a spread to lymph nodes and the bloodstream. Flaviviruses generally replicate in the cytoplasm, but Zika virus antigens have been found in infected cell nuclei.Infection with the virus appears to be linked to the development of unusually small heads and brain damage in newborns (microcephaly). The most dangerous time is thought to be during the first trimester of Pregnancy– when some women do not realize they are pregnant. Experts do not know how the virus enters the placenta and damages the growing brain of the fetus.Diagnosis of Zika Virus:-Sample: Blood, Saliva, Urine.PCR: It is useful in the first 3-5 days after the onset of symptoms. It helps in the direct detection of Zika virus RNA or specific viral antigens in clinical specimens.Serology Test: It detect the presence of antibodies but are useful only after five days.Treatment of Zika Virus:-There is no specific treatment or vaccine currently available.Prevention and Control of Zika Virus:-Avoid travel to areas with an active infestation.Travelers should take the basic precautions to protect themselves from mosquito bites.During outbreaks, health authorities may advise that spraying of insecticides be carried out.Reducing mosquito populations and avoiding bites, which occur mainly during the day.Eliminating and controlling Aedes aegypti mosquito breeding sites reduces the chances that Zika will be transmitted.References:-Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)- Zika Virus.WHO, Media Centre, Fact sheets- Zika virus.Pan American Health Organization- Zika Virus Infection.CNN- Five things you need to know about Zika.CBC Radio Canada- Zika virus: what you need to know.Guardian News and Media Limited- Zika virus: what travellers need to know.The New York Times Company- Short Answers to Hard Questions About Zika Virus.Vox Media, Inc.- Zika virus, explained in 6 charts and maps.Microbeonline- Zika virus: Transmission, Pathogenesis, symptoms and laboratory diagnosis.Wikipedia- Zika virus."
508,"Roll up your sleeves and do it.Block out large chunks of time in regular intervals (… a few hours a day, ideally; but whatever your schedule allows). Sit down in a quiet place. Turn off televisions, phones, music, distractions, etc. Get a book(*), read a lesson, do 50 problems drilling the skills of that lesson.Repeat.I put an asterisk on “book,” to clarify that I mean a “book” in a functional sense. Maybe your “book” is electronic, for example. If your book is a website, you have to be very disciplined to not switch to some other site just for a few seconds to check in on something.You can watch videos if you want, and if you feel they’re helpful. But one thing is certain: you will never learn algebra 1 if you don’t do exercises. Ideally, lots of them.The good news is, you can do this in a short time. You can stop reading now if you like, but I’ll finish up with a little story from my education:I switched schools in 8th grade. Unbeknownst to me, the book I used in the first school was basically in the reverse order of the book I used at the next one. That meant I saw half of algebra 1 twice, and didn’t see the other half at all. Worse yet, I didn’t discover this until the final exam: I had no idea about half the stuff. So I got an F in the class.This was scary for me because (a) I knew I wasn’t an F student, and (b) the F meant I’d be placed into “math for dummies” next year. Fortunately, the F came in 8th grade. (For international readers: US colleges only look at your academic record from 9th grade on. So this F wouldn’t hurt me in that way.)In any case, I explained the situation to the 9th grade school administration, and somehow managed to get placed in the advanced math class on the condition I get up to speed on algebra by myself.So I did what I suggested above: over the summer, I worked through the first part of my algebra book. Sometimes I sat down for hours at a time, sometimes just 15–20 minutes a day. But I was relentless.If you can do that, you can learn algebra. In fact, you can learn a lot more."
509,"I want to throw in an opinion as a prof & advisor, as well as some personal reflection.Students mostly fail college courses because the instructor failed them; that is, if you ask the students, that's what they say. Professors say most students fail to put in sufficient time. Who's right? Well, I've never failed a student who didn't know they were failing well before the end of the course, and it was never the first conversation I had with a student. I teach at a very small school that has an expectation of such attention, and I enjoy... when the student turns it around. I have never failed a student who completed all of the assignments, not because I have a policy, but because if you complete the assignments, actually take the exams (yes, students regularly skip exams), and attend class, you're committed enough to do the additional work to study. If you aren't committed, there's nothing on this earth that will fix it for you.It's completely possible that your professor is an idiot, or that you don't understand her, or that her accent is too think, or that she doesn't know how to teach. The usual underlying source of the problem is that not every student-instructor matchup is ideal or works. We all do our level best to teach as broadly as we can. However, you can take the class with the same professor, or a different professor, or you may not have a choice. Research has shown that it makes no statistical difference. There's a confirmation bias, though; students who retake the class tend to either drop it or pass. The ones who would have failed dropped instead, so the anecdotal evidence of Professor Foo being better than Professor Bar is biased. Think about it; why would it be more likely that the second professor was better?If you decide to or have to retake a class, you need to make a decision: are you going to commit to it, or are you going to fail again? You know that if you repeat what you did before, you'll almost certainly fail (students getting 59%, or whatever the cutoff is, are so exceptionally rare; most get 45% or below). You know that you have to commit more time, make more of an effort, and learn more than you did the last time. If you decide that you're going to do what it takes, and follow through on that, you'll do fine. Now, ""what it takes"" might be a lot: more studying, reading the book before and after each class, going to office hours, doing every bit of extra credit offered, spending time with tutors or TAs every week... now you have the advantage of Khan Academy, YouTube, countless websites explaining any possible subject, and if you make an effort, you'll find someone who can explain the concepts so that you understand.The student who retakes a class and fails again, though, typically do none of those things. They do have an advantage over the last time, which is that they were at least exposed to most/all of the content before, but that creates a risk; students will rationalize ""I started failing in Week 6, so I'll just skip until then"", not realizing that the roots of their failure almost certainly started earlier. It's hard to retake a course with the same prof covering the same material the same way; it's usually like rewatching a movie you didn't like, three times a week for 50 minutes.So, what can you do? If you are retaking a course you should:1. Literally plan all of your hours into a calendar online/on your phone, including reading hours, reviewing hours, hours in tutoring, study group hours, and homework hours, starting with the assumption that for every hour in class, you should spend 3 hours working (you won't be perfect, but keep to this as much as possible)2. Plan these hours over the whole week; work on it every day, even if only for 30 minutes3. Use every resource you have; if you get your homework done and are sure it's right, but still have time left, spend that time doing other problems from the book, or that you find online4. Take notes in class by hand; this has been shown to improve student performance across the board, in part because you have notes to study from, in part because thinking through the material in order to write what you can before the next point comes up will help you remember, and because you will be paying attention in class (most of the time; no one's perfect)Assuming it's a class that meets three hours per week, you'll need to study 12 hours per week. In four weeks, that's a total of 48 hours. It sounds like a lot, but c'mon, everyone's killed two days doing nothing.At 4 weeks in (or after the first exam), go talk to the prof and ask how you are doing. If you are failing again, it's time to start a dialog, but now you can talk about all of the effort you are putting in in concrete terms. It's very common for a student to say ""I studied a lot!"" and mean they studied for 2 hours the day before the exam (often because that is a lot, to them), so yeah, we tend to assume you aren't putting in the effort. Again, the actual ""intellectual failure"" is very uncommon, so don't worry about this too much.If you are doing well, you can back off on the hours, but slowly and carefully.Now, I know it seems like I'm answering a different question: how do I succeed when I retake a class? Yes, but I'm doing it as preparation for my answer.It can feel either freeing or humiliating. If you believe that you are far too intelligent to need to put in the hours of work recommended above (or anything close), and you retake the class and try to pass the same way, and fail again, you'll be humiliated, usually after spending the semester ""bored"". It might seem that all the effort would feel humiliating, but it feels freeing as you see your control of yourself and your growing mastery of the material. You'll find that your social life doesn't suffer (much), and you'll know that you can work your ass off. You'll know that in a crunch, you can and will put in the effort. And unlike believing in your innate intelligence, which is just what you happened to end up with, your ability to work hard is a reflection on character, which you can control. You're also much more likely to be engaged, rather than bored.I've been doing this for over 20 years, both as a student and now as a professor. I've successfully guided many students from F's to C's and even A's and B's. The tendency to blame the failure on the prof, the book, the system, the man... it's not borne out by the data. I'm not saying it doesn't happen; I'm just saying it's rare.sotl;dr It feels how you want it to feel; if you repeat and get the same outcome, you'll be humiliated, but if you commit, there's nothing like the feels you get passing a class that you previously failed, and it feels good during, too."

511,"In my own experience, it was far too easy to “have a form of godliness” without actually being godly or righteous.In my case, I think I did it because I feared the censure and rancor from family members (especially my parents) and Christians if I admitted that I struggled with my faith. So it was easier to pretend everything was all right. I still remember the one time I went to my mother, nearly in tears, because I found it easier to love my kitten than to love God. She turned on me, glaring at me, and snapped, “Did your kitten die on the cross for you?! How could you even say such a thing?” When my mother blurted to my grandmother that I was considering suicide, my grandmother’s only response was to harrumph, “You’ll go to hell!” So I learned that, in spite of the biblical admonition to “confess your faults one to another,” I couldn’t expect any compassion or understanding, only platitudes and condemnation. I chose to “go along to get along.”No one really wanted to hear that I had questions, felt daunted and defeated with the challenges of “being a good Christian,” or that I was troubled about a problem I had with health or finances. They wanted me to just smile because “Jesus loves you! Why wouldn’t you smile just knowing that?” Or else they’d cue up the false sympathy. “What’s WRONG, Natasha? Did I hit a nerve?” (Or some iteration of “How is telling you what the Bible says not showing you compassion?”)This happened a lot at the Christian college I went to. Ensemble members were held up as model students, and your level of spirituality was largely measured by how many demerits you had or how “cheerful and submissive” you presented yourself. So long as my skirt was long enough, and I wore my hosiery outside the dorms, no one cared about my relationship with God. The pastor of the church even made it a point to warn students that it’s harder to have a relationship with God there because it’s so easy to pretend just to fit in. It was like a Stepford Wives community."

514,"They have an increased risk of dying sooner than normal.There are many, many forms of anaemia but by definition anaemia is a condition in which there is a deficiency of red cells or of haemoglobin in the blood, resulting in pallor and weariness.Haemoglobin is an Oxygen Carrier.  Also known a red blood cells. A drop of blood contains millions of red blood cells. These specialised cells are like flattened discs, which gives them a much greater surface area with which to exchange oxygen and carbon dioxide in the lungs and with body cells.Without the proper exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide, there can be discomfort, a drop in quality of life, and possibly many life-threatening complications later down the line.In the example of B12 deficiency, my body was anaemic because I no longer had the essential nutrient for my bone marrow to make new red blood cells. My red blood cells started to become deformed to compensate for the loss in numbers. I became weak, nauseous, out of breath and confused. I also started having heavy bleeding, night sweats and an ill-looking complexion.Had I not been treated for my anaemia, I could have had permanent nerve damage and possibly brain damage. Pernicious Anaemia is called this because it used to be fatal.Many other forms of anaemia are a lot more manageable and less severe - or could take decades before they become a problem."
515,"Thanks for A2AI own a macbook pro (late 2009) at home for personal use and iMac 27″ 2016 latest model in office (so i know how it feels when you work on new and old models :-)I am thinking now what i will gonna do if i am at your place here are few pointsMy very first opinion is to wait.I should wait for few months if newer model is coming since buying a new macbook is big investment (atleast to me :-) )as i will use it for next couple of years (newer model will help you to do faster and better in coming years. As we understand that, day by day newer apps and software versions requires more memory and faster processor.Inshort waiting for newer model worth the wait and will be beneficial for your upcoming task for next few years - although the current macbook will do the tasks as well but newer is better.There are other reasons as well. Since past few years apple is constructing macbooks with non upgradeable memory feature (memories are soldered on board)Buying a newer model will give you the opportunity to get more RAM at faster bus speed (again benifical for your future use)The only reason to buy the current macbook is if you need it urgently in few days or by next month.The price will not be much higher when they launched new model and on the other hand the price will drop instantly on current model. Why invest on the item which we know will be less worth as soon as newer model come in market (which is expecting soon) think for a mement about what will be the re-sale value of your expensive machine in just next two yearsNewer is betterCheers hope this helpsRegards"
516,"YES, Brain is a delicate structure, can be damaged by very trivial change in physiology of CSF. But of course, just sleeping head covered does not damage brain.Sleeping head covered by clothing, blanket etc , make your own exhaled air enhaled which contains more carbon dioxide.Carbon dioxide in small amounts acts as respiratory stimulant.While sleeping your oxygen demand is decreased due to reduced metabolism.Hence oxygen demand is reduced.But it's better to sleep without perfumes, deodorant etc.Keep sleeping comfortably,body will adopt a safer and comfortable position.Enjoy sleeping."
517,"As an anecdote, I was conversing with a Chinese-American Evangelist who stated that Christianity was persecuted and repressed within mainland China. However, I didn’t agree because Christians were not singled out for harsher treatment from society and politics. When we both attempted to explain our positions, he argued that the CCP was a dictatorship which should be overthrown to deliver social and religious freedom. Although I agreed that the Communist Party was often heavy-handed, I was appalled by his willingness to dismantle the existing order (rather than attempting to work within the system) for reform, which could throw China “into another bloody civil war” or enable foreign powers “to reimpose unequal treaties”.In retrospect, I believe that roots of our disagreement stem from Confucianism and Christianity, which believes that original sin is inherited as an act of turning away from God, who empowers an individual’s free will by granting them the choice to establish a personal, heartfelt relationship with Him. This contrasts with a Confucian assertion that people are born inherently good, but chose to become evil after performing behavior that harmed them and society. I thus attempted to revolve my personal habits and lifestyle around a collectivist viewpoint that idealized “stability and harmony” on earth, but not heaven.As a result, a Confucian does not consider him/herself to take priority over other people and the nation-state. Their social roles remain more or less unspoken, so individuals and the CCP expected each other to follow tacitly agreed-upon limits until very recently. If citizens did not oppose the government, they were ignored and allowed to gain wealth. The political reformers were also satisfied, because it was possible for potential (albeit gradual) reform in the government. The modern centralized administration arose from warlord-ruled provinces that reunified in a life-and-death struggle against a shared enemy during the Second Sino-Japanese War (1937–1945), despite their cultural, ethnic, and geographic divisions. Despite this, Confucianism is ultimately responsible for creating and actively enforcing a “tyranny of the majority” because an individual’s rights are carefully controlled by the government and society. Although rulers attempt to gain their legitimacy by catering to public opinion, this can easily silence dissent: “the nail that sticks up is hammered down”. (出る釘は打たれる)Similar themes can be found in Squirrel and Hedgehog, when the spy from Flower Hill sent a warning with his own blood.Unlike Christianity’s assertion of an Absolute Truth and divine intervention in human affairs, Confucius told his followers to “respect ghosts and spirits, but keep them at a distance.” Instead of turning to God, I looked toward the past to discern cultural and historical patterns which could explain this authoritarian leadership: In short, the overthrow of a dynasty was a power grab (not a quest for liberty) under a new emperor, whose own descendants were toppled after they became unresponsive to the welfare of the population or lost control of China’s internal and external affairs. This cycle continued for 4000 years, opening the door for bloodshed, famine, national division, and foreign invasion without any long-lasting changes. The U.S. Constitution, however, was based upon the idea of God-given rights (“We hold these truths to be self-evident and that all men are created equal”), creating a highly flawed, but self-correcting democracy with active civic participation among well-educated and propertied white males in 1791."

520,"I take Spirulina daily 3 grams AM and 3 grams PM and I have been doing this for many years. I have noticed my health is more balanced and easier to maintain since I have been taking it. NASA even say you could survive on it alone.Here are some bits from various sources including the Diet DiaryDiet Diary: Astronauts’ meal — Power-food for earthlingsSpirulina, an ancient staple food of the Azetacs and Mesoamericans, is now available as a food supplement at health food storesSpirulina, a blue-green algae that is available in the form of powder, capsule and tonic, can help regulate blood sugar, blood pressure and cholesterolSpirulina, an ancient staple food of the Azetacs and Mesoamericans, is now available as a food supplement at health food stores. The blue-green algae shot to fame in the 1970s when National Aeronautical and Space Agency (NASA), USA, used it for astronauts food in space Spirulina is rich in proteins (60%), amino acids, essential fatty acids, Gamma-linolenic acid (GLA) fatty acids, nucleic acids (DNA and RNA), beta-carotene (pro-vitamin A), vitamins- B, C & E, minerals like iron, potassium, magnesium, sodium, phosphorus and calcium, and phytochemicals such as chlorophyll (the green pigment) and phycocyanin (a blue pigment). Its outstanding nutritional profile, high protein and low calorie count makes it a ‘superfood’.Centuries ago, the Aztecs and the Mayas realised the healing properties of spirulina and enjoyed this source of vegetable nutrition as a ‘power-food’ to boost their energy levels and enhance stamina.Recent scientific research has revealed numerous health benefits of this ‘super-food’. Spirulina has been shown to help regulate blood sugar, blood pressure and cholesterol, alleviate pain, inflammation and allergies, balance the immune system, improve digestion by increasing good gut flora and deliver antioxidant activity to protect from life-threatening diseases like cancer, Alzheimers and strokes.It has also been shown to suppress appetite and help weight watchers. Its high beta-carotene content helps maintain good skin and hair.A study conducted at the JC Bose Institute of Life Sciences, Bundelkhand University, Jhansi, published in ‘Current Pharmaceutical Biotechnology’ in 2005, reported that spirulina improves the activity of white blood cells, stimulates antibodies and increases the population of natural killer cells.Spirulina’s concentrated nutrition makes it an ideal food supplement for people of all ages and lifestyles, fussy eaters and especially those who do not manage to eat adequate amount of vegetables. However, pregnant and lactating women and people allergic to seafood or seaweed must consult their physician.Tropical weather, strong sunshine, pure water resource and pollution-free environment is all what Spirulina needs for its cultivation. However, if water is polluted or contaminated with heavy metals, it is not suitable for spirulina cultivation as these metals and toxins will get highly concentrated in spirulina and make it unsuitable for human consumption. Hence, the source and purity of spirulina is critical.Commercially, Spirulina is available in the form of powder, tablet, capsule and health tonic. It can be added to soups, pastas, fruits, vegetables, salads, pulses and lentils. Being high on nutrition and easy on digestion, it certainly is a good addition to our daily diet."
521,"Hi asker,I have been browsing through the internet and found this:the definition of usqueWhen you search the word “usque”, you get a latin phrase that nobody seems to know. The difficulty rating is higher than any other words mentioned here.It is not 100% English, but it is from dictionary.com, so I thought I might as well as share it if I have the knowledge.Hope I answered your question!"
522,"Love seems like a mystery. I killed animals as a kid and never felt bad about it. I don’t feel emotions about lying, cheating, or stealing. I’m not sure what guilt or joy really is. Why do I hardly feel any emotions?"
523,"Let me first say this: You're not limited to cardio. Even people who can't walk can still lift weights or at least their own bodyweight.Now that's out of the way, let's say this cardio is cycling or running. If cardio is the only thing you can do then 10-15 minute sprints (sprints so you're mostly at top speed) or 1 hour of cycling every day should do the trick.What you're after with this type of exercise will only be focused on overall health and maybe some form of muscle growth specially with your legs and core (yes, sprinting can develop the core)If you want, I recommend kettlebell training as its both cardio and weight lifting in one go.http://www.fitandwrite.com/lot-e..."
524,"Many things can cause this. Roughhousing can cause play biting, this is not out of aggression and is simply intended to be in good fun even if the dog is being rough. If that's not it, and if you are calmly disciplining your dog, gently but firmly it can be a good sign your dog is in pain. Make sure you are not doing anything to make the dog feel threatened either. Even big dogs can get scared easily by yelling or putting your hands on the dog aggressively. If your dog isn't being frightened, take him/her to a vet. Dogs can become very aggressive when sick or in pain so it could very well be a health problem. Maybe he/she has other issues. Shelter dogs can come from anywhere, your dog could have been abused or simply taught to be aggressive by a previous owner, if that's the case training is needed before things escalate. Also learn your dogs body language so you can know when he/she doesn't want to be messed with. It is most likely a very fixable problem. Overall make sure the dog feels safe, comfortable and isn't ill."
525,"There are many different ways of treating severe arthritis. The way used to treat arthritis may depend on the symptoms and type of arthritis affecting the person.i) Medication - Most people who experience severe arthritis will normally see a medical doctor to get medication to ease and reduce their arthritis pain. Doctors will normally prescribe NSAIDs( Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs) to reduce inflammation and swelling. These NSAIDs may be beneficial in treating the symptoms and providing short term relief to those suffering from severe arthritis. Some commonly used NSAIDs include aspirin, ibuprofen and naproxen. You also need to be aware that these NSAIDs may cause side effects like stroke, heart attack, stomach ulcers and kidney damage. In view of this, these drugs can be used for short term pain relief.ii) Physiotherapy - Together with medication, physiotherapy plays an important role in managing arthritis pain. It can help you maintain independence through improved strength, mobility and flexibility. Physiotherapists will examine your muscles, posture and the way you walk and this includes activities that causes you pain. They will design a personalised treatment plan which may include hydrotherapy, massage and pain relief techniques.iii) Surgery - For those people having advance arthritis, medication will no longer be an option. They will have to go for surgery to have arthritis pain relief. The operations may includea) replacing a badly damaged jointb) releasing trapped nervesc) removing the inflamed lining of the joint cavityd) removing bone to relieve paine) repairing damaged tendonsIn most cases surgeries have been successful in restoring the knee-joints and reducing the pain substantially. The disadvantage of surgery is that it is costly and there are cases where surgery fail to restore the knee joint.iv) Exercise - For osteoarthritis, exercise may be the preferred option. Exercise can help relieve stiffness, reduce pain and swelling and also improve muscle and bone strength. The exercise programs may includea) low-impact aerobic activityb) range of motion exercise for flexibilityc) strength training for muscle tonev) Weight management - Losing weight is another way that can greatly reduce knee-joint pain. When a person has excess weight, this extra weight will normally add additional pressure on the knee-joint which aggravates the arthritis pain. Young adults who are categorised as obese should try to lose weight as this will delay the onset of getting arthritis and joint pain. Another thing about maintaining the right weight is that you will have less health problems as you grow older.vi) Lifestyle changes - People who are afflicted by arthritis should participate in stress reducing activities like meditation, yoga or tai-chi.We can improve the strength and flexibility of the joints by practicing certain yoga postures. These postures include Warrior pose, Tree pose, Triangle pose, Bridge posture and Corpse pose. If you regularly practice yoga using the right postures coupled with meditation, you can get pain relief from arthritis.vii) Healthy and balanced diet - Eat a healthy diet full of fruits and vegetables, which contain important vitamins and minerals, especially vitamin E. Eat foods rich in omega-3 fatty acids, such as cold water fish(salmon, mackerel, and herring), flaxseed, rapeseed (canola) oil.You can treat the arthritis pain that you are suffering with one of the above mentioned ways. You should carefully consider your circumstances and situation that you are in before deciding which approach will bring the desired outcome.And finally a solution that I think will help you: Completely Heal Any Type Of Arthritis In 21 Days Or Less Following This Step-By-Step Strategy – 100% Guaranteed!"
526,"If this is a one-time event I would apply a heating pad to relax the muscles. However, if this is frequent or persistent then I would consult a rheumatoligist to determine if I were developing arthritis. The most important thing to do whenever there is persistent pain is to obtain a diagnosis to ensure proper treatment is being provided. Early diagnosis is key to minimizing irreparable damage."
527,"Well it depends on the span of time you stay and visit Nepal. If you are staying for a short time, then don't miss majestic Pokhara, go to Poon hill trekking which will take you another 3 days. Don't miss to visit the 3 Durbar Square of Kathmandu, Lalitpur and Bhaktapur districts while you are at Kathmandu. You can visit Swayambhu and Bouddha Stupas if you like to. Go for a sunrise view at Nagarkot. If you are staying for a longer period, I would recommend you Annapurna Base Camp trek, also known as Royal Trekking Route in Nepal. If you want a bit more tougher trekking, then go to Larke Pass trekking. Both trekking take about 12 days to accomplish. And if you want to go somewhere that many haven't been, then I recommend Rara National Park in Karnali region. I bet you will fall in love with the place. You can go to Lumbini-the birthplace of Gautam Buddha too. Beautiful tea gardens of east- Illam can be good choice. But you should make up your mind for some hasty off road riding experiences too."
528,"This is what I personally would do/have done. I would recommend not trying this unless if you’re comfortable with your computer. Also, this is more of a “better to be safe than sorry later” approach to destroying viruses.You’re going to want to boot the computer into Safe Mode. That can easily be done on all computers by searching the computer for “msconfig” and clicking on it. In the window that pops up, select the “Boot” tab and select “Safe boot” and make sure to tick the “Network” box just so you can access the internet while you’re in safe mode and restart the computer. If you’re unable to access it this way, restart the computer and press “F8” until a screen appears and select “Safe Mode with Networking” from the list.The purpose for booting the computer into Safe Mode is so that there won’t be anything but Windows basic services loading (Example: Mouse, Keyboard, Graphics Card). This minimizes the chance that programs that are part of the virus will be running.Next, go through your virus scan with Malwarebyte’s Anti-Malware. Once the scan is finished, delete the files it finds. Next, go into your browser and look at any add-ons or extensions that are installed. You can run a google search of each add-on or extension to verify that it’s legit. Any that aren’t, delete. The next step from here would be to go into “Add or Remove Programs” in the Control Panel and look at everything that’s installed on your computer. Most viruses will actually be a little arrogant and register it’s program into there. Anything that isn’t Windows related would be something to research in order to track down what virus infected you and how to deal with it. Not to mention, you’ll find where the file folders for these are and can delete them.If you accessed Safe Mode from pressing “F8” on your keyboard at the start of your computer, you can skip this last step. If not, you’ll want to go back into the “Boot” tab of “msconfig” and untick “Safe boot”. This will stop your computer from booting into safe mode every single time you restart your computer.Congratulations, you most likely have removed the virus and most certainly will want to download an antivirus that is constantly scanning any activity on your computer such as Malwarebyte’s Anti-Malware Premium, Avast, AVG, Zone Alarm or Kaspersky. The most important thing to remember is that the web is a dangerous place to be without some form of constant protection."

532,"Here is the state of the world now (only highlights).North Korea- Has missiles and Nukes in its stockpile. Their missiles do not have enough range to reach continental US. Even if they somehow manage to strike a few Nukes at the US, it will only affect the impact zones immediately. So it will result in the total wipe out of NK in the US’s retaliation. North does not want to nuke the south coz their first goal is to take over the south and unite the Koreas. It does not want to attack any of its neighbors simply because there are no compelling reasons to do so for North. So there’s no real threat.Russia- She has a lot of technologically advanced weapons. Some even better than the US. She has a stock pile of Nukes and intercontinental ballistic missiles. But they have one thing working against them. Their own economy. Their economy is weak. They cannot keep the supplies alive to support an all out war or an invasion. No place can be dominated or occupied without boots on the ground. So there’s no real threat.China- She has the largest army. Lot of hardware, strong economy, many missiles and long history as well. What is working against them is their size and their political leadership. Most of the weapons in their arsenal are old and reverse engineered stuff from the Soviet era. They are modernizing however, but not at the rates they want. Also their navy and air force does not have enough hardware to back an invasion. So no real threat.India- Certainly a large number of people, large army. Relatively modern Air force and Navy. India is historically peaceful and non-aggressive they have stood their ground against aggressors but never pushed back. Also the air force does not have the infrastructure to support an invasion. Navy has inadequate number of modern vessels. Submarine fleet is aging. Modernization is happening at a snail’s pace. Political leadership is not helping with the process either. So no real threat.Europe- Collectively, very powerful and has strategic advantage over the rest of the world due to sheer strength and size of hardware of individual members and the collective strategic knowledge and experience. However, Europe is not as united as they wish to be. Member nations have trust issues with each other due to leftover emotions from previous two world wars. Also there is an impending financial crisis and a social crisis due to the refugee movement. So no real threat.Africa-Individual nations(some of them) may be strong enough to defend own territories against invaders, however none of the African nations are strong enough to launch a war or an invasion against even their Asian neighbors; let alone European or American. Also, most of the continent is torn apart by countless civil wars, racial and tribal conflicts and regional disputes. There is not enough reasons for an outward spill-over of the conflicts. So no real threat.South America- Same as Africa. Third world countries, slow or crippled economies, poverty, smaller, largely inadequate military forces. There are no compelling reasons for them to cause a large scale conflict, let alone global. So no real threat.Middle East- There are a few who can put up a real tough fight against an invading foreign military.Their situational awareness, familiarity with terrain and guerrilla tactics are all advantageous but only works withing the region so they are only good at defense. Certain countries possess good hardware and moderately large modern armed forces. However, none of the Middle Eastern countries possess the military strength to lead an invasion on foreign land or sustain the defense of their own territories for a long time (including Iran). Also they are not synonymous with the modern equipment that they possess. This is because of lack of experience in large scale multi-face, multi-theater warfare and lack of trust between troops. This seriously undermines the collective efforts. So no real threat.Last but not least,USA- Uncle Sam checks off all items on the list when it comes to size, numbers and weaponry. Certainly strong, economy wise. Has a global reach and has lead countless invasions, successfully. They are already the dominating force and has a firm hand of control over the world with many military bases in strategic locations across the entire planet. She is ruling the world now, at least by a big margin (Economically, politically and strategically). So she wouldn’t do anything that would start a third world war and cause a global meltdown. Because once the world goes in to the chaos of war, the balance of power might tip against them. Off course she will get involved in many other small scale conflicts, trying to bring down a dictatorship or install a new one, home-delivering freedom and democracy to the needful. Still, no real threat.Unless something dramatic plays out anytime soon or some nut job decides to let some nukes loose willy-nilly, we are certainly not heading towards a third world war. So just relax and have a cold beer."

Without tune :This is the tricky part.Often musicians will be pleased to make songs with lyrics on hand.Ultimately both complements one another.If the tune is not ready and you have to start up with ur work first ,Dont think of chorus first !Make rough draft with the stanzas first.Chorus portions must gently slip into the song .It is often soothing /energetic (depending upon the situation ).If you find it difficult to find rhyming words , always have a discussion board with the creative people whom you know.A collective effort can be more helpful(provided the number of persons accompanying is less as too many people getting their hands on a single job often leads to mishap )Apart from these have a good spot to write you song which is naturally compelling you to be more creativeAnd thanks for the A2A!"

My grandma is old and can't walk very well so I was waiting with her for my uncle to get some fish. This huge man comes and picks me up from behind. I'm pretty strong, but this man was much stronger. He grabbed me and ran as I screamed for my uncle to help me. He came too late.So. The big man “A”The other men are “B” “C” and “D”A grabbed me and brought me to a cornerB C D take turns throwing me against a fence as they all undress. They all are on me at the same time.

One would be holding down my legs.They tied down my arms above my head, stripped me naked, did their rotations, and broke my ankle.I kept squirming so they punched me, gagged me, and stabbed right below my ribcage with a knife. I stopped moving and they rotated a few times. When they were done, about and hour later, they tied to me to fence.They would grab me from behind, touch all over me, cum on me, and then forced me to masturbate. They stuck their fingers up my vagina, put their dicks in my mouth. They made me masturbate on the floor, and then would smack me with their dicks wherever they felt like it.It was torturous. I was in so much pain. They ran Away. The police were searching everywhere, and then one found me on the floor behind a trashcan in an alley. They took me to a hospital, and it gave me so much emotional trauma.Right now, a year later, I am crying in my room, too scared to go anywhere, ripping at my thighs and stomach with a blade. Burning with lighters. I never told anyone else. The only people that know is my grandma, uncle, mom, and dad. I'm too scared to tell anyone."

You can make a device that does a lot of fusion cheaply in your garage (Fusor). Table top fusion is something we solved long ago.The problem is scalability and self-sustainability. To get enough energy density to make it economical, you need to deal with high density plasmas, which is hard.

A good chunk of the money that goes into fusion research is actually going into making and studying these dense, hot plasmas.What most people don't seem to understand is that fusion research is mostly fundamental/pure science, because we simply don't know enough about these things to get to the engineering problems that we'll have to solve to do them practically.To put this in perspective, when 10 billion is spent on the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), and it does something unexpected, it's a success. When 10 billion is spent on the National Ignition Facility, and it does something unexpected, it's a failure. This is the fundamental misconception of fusion research, people think that it is failed engineering instead of successful pure science."

543,"Hello UserI presume that you are aware of the Quora BNBR policy and how posts that are reported often lead to people being banned from Quora?I looked at your contributions and seriously I didn’t think that anything was “over the BNBR limit” even though some things would annoy neutral Quorans.For example, your questions about Israel and condemnation of Japanese WWII atrocities have a very obvious answer that essentially Israel was created by United Nations Resolution 181(II) in 1947, which was AFTER WWII which ended in 1945, so there isn’t much relevance to the question. Are you trying to accuse Israel and Japan of something? I don’t know.On your question regarding Israel’s occupation of Zone C of West Bank, are you aware that Israel is supposed to occupy this area according to the Oslo Accords. The Oslo Accords granted the Palestinians autonomy in Zone A, but they are still a long way off from being accepted in the UN as a full member state. They only have non-member observer status. The problem behind this question is that Hamas, BDS, and other Islamist Palestinian groups name all of Israel “occupied Palestine”. When they refer to the occupation, they are calling for the expulsion of Jews from Israel and handing their land and possessions over to Muslims without compensation. Your question does not support their view, but is likely to be misconstrued.Looking at your upvotes, I noticed that you upvoted a known antisemitic cartoon - something that is likely to annoy many people on Quora.However I doubt that Quora moderators will ban you for any of this. All that will happen is that some people might be annoyed and will report, but that’s about all."
544,"It feels like being immersed in a virtual reality with incredibly vivid graphics which allows you to fulfill your wildest fantasies.There are a few key things I noticed though:Every lucid dream is different in terms of quality (how vidid, sharp and beliveable objects are), stability (not waking up) and control (the degree to which you can influence your dream landscape)For some reason, gravity is all skewed up. I would compare it to lunar surface gravity.You can’t perform sophisticated intellectual tasks without waking up. Shame we can’t do that though, I guess that part of our brain is shut off.Sex feels amazingly real.Sometimes (not always) you can summon people, objects, places at your command which is REALLY awesome.Characters in your dreams are highly sophisticated, almost as if they were not a part of your mind, but entities of their own. You can’t really predict them.Flying is something every novice lucid dreamer starts off with. It really is very cool.Telling your dream characters they’re only part of your imagination and looking at their reactions is hilarious!You can “talk” to your subconscious mind. In other words, you can ask it a question with an intention of getting an answer and often times you will get it. It’s like sitting at a desk for a giant computer. It’s brilliant.Things I’ve done in lucid dreams - composed music, flew and flew and flew (and flew some more), had mindblowing sex with the girls of my dreams (get it?), talked with some of my idols (some of them long passed away), generally admired the highly sophisticated level of detail that my mind constructed the environment with."
545,"I will answer this as someone who is currently considered very attractive (I’m a dancer and former model) but I haven’t always been attractive. In fact, I was morbidly obese most my life (I went from 240 to 110lbs in two years with a strict diet and exercise plan) THIS is the old me, 20 years old and 240lbs:And this is me todayHere is what I’ve noticed after losing the weight:1)Women were nicer to me. Not men. Men would hold the doors open and do other polite things, but when it came down to dating or meeting random guys at bars, they seemed to have attitudes with me, as if they half expected me to be a stuck up bitch to them or something. Women from my work however started inviting me out more frequently, wanting to get to know me more, etc. Guys actually hit on me less at bars- maybe because they thought I would turn them down. Either way, I remember having a lot more one night stands as a fatty.2) I got promoted. Then I got another job where I got hired for a position I wasn’t even qualified for. I got the hours I wanted and the days off I wanted too. Life became easier. Previously, I’d work Christmas, thanksgiving, overtime, my days off and I’d never get the raises I asked for.3) When guys invited me out at times I would be told to bring friends for their friends. So I would bring my friends. They would be disappointed. Most of my friends did not look like supermodels. They are heavy girls and are still my lifelong friends . I think most guys assume that hot girls only hang out with other equally hot girls and these guys were horny assholes that just wanted to bang. Which brings me to my next point…4) I get treated like an object. Often. I am used to it now, and I write it off, but guys see girls like me as an accessory. And I’m far too outspoken to be somebody’s eye candy.5) I feel expected to be basic. I’m an outdoorsy, grungy backpacker. I like camping, not wearing makeup, CrossFit, and other masculine activities. A lot of the men I’ve dated are taken aback and other girls I associate with seem to think the key to attracting a man here in Orange County, California is to do my hair perfectly even at the gym, always have perfect gel manicured nails, designer clothes and to not talk too much and give simple answers when dating. I feel like I’m supposed to look like a Barbie and act like deaf mute. Before, I relied heavily on my personality to make friends and date. Now it seems like it’s frowned upon because I have to “make them work for it” and the kinds of guys that want to go out with a girl like me are not looking for good conversation as much as they are looking for a pretty lady to accompany them to parties.6) I have more opportunities. It’s amazing really. Now that I’m almost 30 and I’ve been thin for about 7 years, I’ve noticed that with age, both men and women alike treat me with respect. It is easier to meet people, go places, and get help in times of need. It’s pretty crazy how many people have stopped to try to help me in when I was traveling abroad just because I looked lost. And someone once called me an Uber (and paid for it) when my phone was dead and I lost my friends outside of a crowded bar. One time when my tire popped on the street, a guy driving behind me went out of his way to help me change the tire and offered to call AAA in case the spare didn’t work.Ultimately people notice you more and care more about pleasing you. But often there is stigma attached. People assume you are snooty, too good for them or that you’ve always had things handed to you. Not the case for me. I worked my ass off to get where I am, I am far from stuck up and I’m attracted to good personalities rather hot bodies. The drastic changes however are still very eye opening to me to this day. Thanks for reading :)"
546,Definitely Yes. Let me tell my own experience. I had completed 12th Science from WB Board with 75% in 2015. I was not very clear about my goals and after discussing with my parents I decided to chose CA. I registered for CPT Dec 15. I had 4.5 months from Aug- Dec . I thought it would be better to focus on self study because I did not know the very basics of accounting and other commerce subjects and no teacher will teach the very basics. I studied for 4.5 months and cracked CPT with 70%.What I have learnt is that CA needs perseverance or consistency. If you study daily for 5–6 hours then you can definitely clear cpt.Best of Luck!!

548,"I graduated from UCLA with a degree in Applied Mathematics.  The GE math classes for non-math majors are pretty big, just like every GE class for those outside a major.  For the math majors, in four years I never had a math class bigger than 30 people and some as small as seven.The biggest thing I remember many years later is how much variety in math exists once you get past calculus.  I loved actuarial mathematics, a class that used math to study traffic patterns, the classes that used basic programming/Mathematica to solve problems.  I hated set theory and non-linear equations.I'm pretty good, but there were other students that blew me away by how well they comprehended everything.  I wasn't in the same league as the top few students in the class.  (I know one went on to pursue a PhD in math at CalTech.)  The professors and TAs are all extremely intelligent, but still patient enough to help you get through a problem; but you will have to visit them during office hours and put in the effort.It is challenging, and you want to make sure you enjoy mathematics, as opposed to statistics, physics, economics, or engineering.  (One of the jokes I had with a physics major was that if something worked 10/10 times, they would assume it worked every time, where I had to go prove it worked every time.)  Studying math teaches you the analytical skills and processes to solve a variety of complex problems."
549,"Like all the engineers, I also had a dream. To get placed in an MNC with decent package. I studied in a good college, got great grades and got placed in a reputed MNC. I still remember the day when I got placed. Everyone was happy for me. My father, mother, brother, sister. I can even remember the lines that everyone told me.Father: I knew it. Well done. I am proud of you.Mother: God bless you son. You fulfilled my dream.Brother: Well done. Congrats.Sister: Many congratulations brother. You are the best.I was very happy not because I got a job but because of the happiness that my whole family was cherishing at that moment of life. I became the prime member of the family. I felt like I am something that matters. With all the happiness and dreams in my eyes, I started my journey of corporate life, in none other than the place, the dream city, Mumbai.Everything was going great. Initial training was going on. After 15 days of training, I heard a rumor that, due to some bullshit reason company was firing some GET’s. I quickly reached to the notice board. There I saw, my name was also on the list. I couldn’t believe that. I immediately rushed to the HR team and they confirmed the news. I was not able to believe that. How they could do that. We were not even completed our training. How could they judge someone without giving them a chance? I argued but neither they listened, nor they cared. I even pleaded before them that my whole career is at stake, but they told me that either take the reliving or they will be forced to fire me. Anyways, I didn’t have any option but to receive one-month salary and get relieved.They already gave me late joining. Almost one year after I got placed. And now, they fired me for no reason. It also disabled me to get job in other companies because neither I was fresher, nor I had any experience. All my dreams, my parents hope and everything else, got lost.I called my brother. We discussed the matter and I came back to Delhi. The most difficult part was to face the parents. I was not able to tell them the truth for some months because I didn’t want to break the belief that they had in me. But that was not the end of my problems. That was just the beginning.Two Years laterI still didn’t have any job. I tried in many companies, but my year gap was making it very difficult. I prepared for GATE, but I didn’t get IIT’s, so I decided not to join any other college. I had computer science in my B tech and eventually I got a project also, but they closed the deal. So, my hunt was still on to get success and so was my failures. I also had education loan and it’s soaring interest rate was making it difficult to repay. In India, you can get cheaper car loan, house loan, and even personal loan but you can’t get cheaper education loan.In totality, after wasting two precious years of my life, I failed to get a job, I failed to get admission in IIT’s, I failed to complete the project, I failed to repay my education loan, etc. I failed in so many things that I couldn’t even imagine. Everyone who was once proud of me were trying to hide my failures. My parents used to say to our relatives that I wanted to study further, that’s why, I left the job. Once an asset became the liability.That was the stage of my life when all my friends were talking about SIP’s, weekends plan, Goa tour, getting a girlfriend, etc and I was just thinking to get a job. My frustration was at its peak and I even stopped talking with everyone to avoid questions related to my career.One day, my brother came to meet me.He: How are you? You look weak.Me: Yeah. I used to awake late at night.He: Why, what you do?Me: Nothing.He: What do you mean by nothing. Do something.Me: What you expect me to do. I immediately got annoyed and answered rudely. You will not understand, how it feels, when you lose everything especially your job. I am nothing but a loser.He: Who said you are a loser. You are my brother and I know you. You are our biggest asset. As far as job concern, Job is not a criterion to judge your success. It is just a step towards success. He said very calmly.Me: I am sorry brother for my behavior. I was just upset. I said softly.He: It’s okay. Don’t worry you will get success with flying colors.Me: But brother, I failed in so many things.He: He smiled in answer and said. Don’t fail until you fail.I also replied with a smile.One year after that incidentIn one sentence, I learnt everything about the life. I understood that this is not the job that was my biggest problem. The problem, that haunting me was to carry the burden of making it secret from everyone that I am jobless. So, I told everyone that I lost my job and from past two years I was not working anywhere but I will get it within 1 year. I felt relieved after that and then there was no burden on me. I didn’t fail. So, I decided to take the first step towards the success. I worked hard and prepared for government services. Perhaps fortune favors the brave. Now, I am posted in a leading bank. It gave me a flat also. I am leaving it to you people, to guess, where I am posted now. I already repaid my education loan. In past 2 years, I have visited Goa 4 times. I started my SIP’s and I have a girlfriend also. Finally, I am an asset now.It is the real story of a person, who is part of my heart and I am very proud of him."

551,"I don’t talk about personal politics on public forums; instead, I will stick to facts as much as possible. In short, everything below I believe to be true, but not everything I believe is true is written below. (-:It’s far too early to know for sure exactly what the impact will be. As of this writing (mid-Nov 2016) we don’t even know who is going to be in key policy positions. Then, we don’t know how the Senate and House will react to their policy views. We don’t know how much party-line—crossing there will be; likely very little for the most part, but that is harder to predict if a policy is clearly prejudicial or damaging to the economy at large.Now, in terms of impact, there are personal impacts and job impacts.In terms of job impacts, it seems highly unlikely that anyone who is well-educated will do poorly in the short term. The US has tremendous economic opportunities for people who are skilled in high-value fields. Those companies are not going to fill their jobs out of nowhere. If the government starts to put in place policies that make it difficult to hire talented employees, companies will take those positions to where the employees are — abroad — creating exactly the opposite situation of what Trump promised when he ran. Of course, politics rarely follows along strictly rational lines of calculation, but ultimately it’s therefore important to separate bluster for the press versus what actually happens quietly in the background.Keep in mind, also, that if the job market does change by the time you graduate, unless the Revolution comes, you’re hardly the one who will be impacted. Anyone who is willing to pick up sticks, move half-way around the world, deal with differences in language and food and climate and a dozen other things, is likely going to have a place somewhere in the world. Getting a quality education can only help that.In terms of personal impacts, it might depend quite a bit on what you look like — in some locations. However, the vast majority especially of US research universities are not located in the places that are also appear to be the most prejudiced. Indeed, this election further widened the gap between urban and rural areas, and urban areas resoundingly voted for a more global perspective. A student at Brown doesn’t live in the USA as much as they live in Providence, a vibrant, multi-cultural town with numerous nationalities and races represented broadly. Inasmuch as you think the vote for Trump says anything, only about five states gave Clinton a higher percentage of vote (and not by much) than Rhode Island. So to someone who lived here, on a day-to-day basis, there would hardly be any perceptible difference in treatment. If anything, at this moment many people are especially sensitive and careful about how they treat others.It is also easy to forget how much progress has been made in the US. People reading about the election from a distance, getting news dominated by Trump, might be surprised to hear that in this election season, the US has voted in [list courtesy Brighten Godfrey]:Stephanie Murphy (FL) — first Vietnamese-American woman elected to CongressCatherine Cortez Masto (NM) — first Latina elected to U.S. SenatePramila Jayapal (WA) — first person of South Asian descent elected to House of RepresentativesKamala Harris (CA) — first person of South Asian descent elected to U.S. SenateIlhan Omar (MN) — first Somali-American legislator (she was elected to the state house of representatives)Kate Brown (OR) — first openly LGBTQ governorTammy Duckworth (IL) — first female senator that has seen combat, and second Asian-American female senatorSamuel Park (GA) — first openly gay man in the Georgia legislatureand so on. I bet those stories were not covered in the international press. Note that Ilhan Omar is openly Muslim, and even wears a hijab. There are many Muslim countries where she could not even stand for election.Finally, just remember that eight years ago the USA voted in its first black president. Things go in cycles. History is long, and bears reading.Personally, I’m pretty confident I could mail out my resume to a bunch of different countries and get pretty positive responses. (When something happens in the US, I get notification from foreign friends of job postings at their university….) Let’s just say I haven’t dusted off my vita at all. In time, I think most things heal themselves. In the meanwhile, I’m committed to doing what I can to improve the education of students and state of knowledge—the very same things I was committed to the day before the election."
552,"Everybody has given you the straight answer you need, so I’m gonna go down a slightly different path.I recently watched them in chronological order according to internal timeline of the Batman universe, as opposed to the order of the movies as they were made (and which franchises they belonged to), it was kinda like reading the different Batman comic titles simultaneously and allowing for different artists and writers interpretation, but following an “internally logical” chronology.So, I watched them in the following order:1.Batman Begins - You get an origin story and see his first steps in Gotham.2.Batman - You see him beginning to become recognised figure in Gotham and you see the birth of the joker3.Batman Returns - You get the continuation of Batman’s story and the origins of The Penguin and Catwoman.4.The Dark Knight - You get the further exploits of the joker, the birth of two face.5.Batman Forever (barely passable but I allowed it because I was a Jim Carrey fan back in the day) - You get the further exploits of Two-Face and an intro to The Riddler. You also get Dick Grayson’s Robin.6.The Dark Knight Rises - Introduction of Bane and and Talia Ah Ghul. Passing reference to a new Robin (even if it doesn’t follow canon, there have been at least five universally recognised Robins so this kinda fits.)7.Batman Vs Superman: Dawn of Justice - You get the BMvSM storyline and the set up for Justice League which of course are both major parts of the batman mythos.You, of course, have to take into consideration that movies like to kill off characters at the end of one film. But much like the comics Villains keep coming back from the dead."
553,"This one hack can sure as hell help you save minutes and in some cases hours of your day.Remember the last time when you SNOOZED the alarm, not once but thrice and finally woke up an hour later.Also, remember how you got guilty later wasting that one hour and probably missing the breakfast (used to happen a lot with me since I live in a hostel)We all face this daily or at best on weekends when we do not really have to compulsorily wake up on time.After months of this routine I realized no matter how big was the urge of going back to sleep and snoozing that alarm, every time I splashed my face with water, suddenly the sleep ceased to occur. But that’s obvious, ain’t it?.Now, the major hurdle was to get up and walk those 10 long steps to the wash basin and splash.So I thought of this,A simple spray neck (one those barbers use) on a normal bottle beside my bed.Now, every time the alarm beeps and I wake up, first thing I do is immediately splash my face with this sprayer.Thank you.I am always up for a debate.If you are too, ping me Jayesh Ghatkar ."
554,"You asked,How many pounds will I lose if do not eat for a week?About ten pounds.If you have never fasted before, your weight loss will be dramatic in the first few days and then less so each day as you continue in the fast.  For example, in long fasts daily weight loss can be reduced to as little as 4 ounces a day in autophagy for fuel consumption (i.e. close to your basal metabolic rate calculated with full digestive rest) and that's after losing two to three pounds a day.[NOTE: you actually don't lose a lot of water weight in a fast and in fact get more hydrated throughout a fast. Check out your body water composition next time you fast and be amazed how your percentages rise – I've been measured by bioelectric impedance to have started out with a ~65% hydration baseline and risen to over 72% during fasts... trending back towards our natal baseline of 75% water of when we were babies.]In all fasts autophagy of some muscle tissue (protein) occurs and is consumed for fuel only in the first days of the fast, or until the body fully transitions into a ketosis metabolism.  Ketosis means your body will run near exclusively on fat (adipose tissue consumption) as well as any other non-adipose tissues that are damaged and need be recycled.  In most men ketosis happens on average after about 72 hours of fasting and in only 48 hours for women.  Veterans of fasting can drop into ketosis in a matter of hours.Additionally, muscle tissue (protein) on our body weighs much more than fat (adipose tissue) does, but muscle tissue only offers less than half the energy (at 4 calories per gram) than fat tissue does (at 9 calories per gram) when being consumed. Our bodies are not stupid and prefer using fat for fuel for obvious economic reasons, both during fasts and regular feeding periods... if you eat correctly.  And this is also how average weight loss per day tends to drop in fasts, and why people should not be surprised to experience diminishing returns when pursuing  fasts solely for weight loss.  Fat loss is all in the keto-adapted diet and metabolism that burns fat and in getting your basal metabolic rate up while cultivating that diet... rapid weight loss is not always what you want."

556,"How Do ATMs Work?An ATM is simply a data terminal with two input and four output devices. Like any other data terminal, the ATM has to connect to, and communicate through, a host processor. The host processor is analogous to an Internet service provider (ISP) in that it is the gateway through which all the various ATM networks become available to the cardholder (the person wanting the cash).Most host processors can support either leased-line or dial-up machines. Leased-line machines connect directly to the host processor through a four-wire, point-to-point, dedicated telephone line. Dial-up ATMs connect to the host processor through a normal phone line using a modem and a toll-free number, or through an Internet service provider using a local access number dialed by modem.Leased-line ATMs are preferred for very high-volume locations because of their thru-put capability, and dial-up ATMs are preferred for retail merchant locations where cost is a greater factor than thru-put. The initial cost for a dial-up machine is less than half that for a leased-line machine. The monthly operating costs for dial-up are only a fraction of the costs for leased-line.The host processor may be owned by a bank or financial institution, or it may be owned by an independent service provider. Bank-owned processors normally support only bank-owned machines, whereas the independent processors support merchant-owned machines.Parts of the MachineYou're probably one of the millions who has used an ATM. As you know, an ATM has two input devices:Card reader - The card reader captures the account information stored on the magnetic stripe on the back of an ATM/debit or credit card. The host processor uses this information to route the transaction to the cardholder's bank.Keypad - The keypad lets the cardholder tell the bank what kind of transaction is required (cash withdrawal, balance inquiry, etc.) and for what amount. Also, the bank requires the cardholder's personal identification number (PIN) for verification. Federal law requires that the PIN block be sent to the host processor in encrypted form.And an ATM has four output devices:Speaker - The speaker provides the cardholder with auditory feedback when a key is pressed.Display screen - The display screen prompts the cardholder through each step of the transaction process. Leased-line machines commonly use a monochrome or color CRT (cathode ray tube) display. Dial-up machines commonly use a monochrome or color LCD.Receipt printer - The receipt printer provides the cardholder with a paper receipt of the transaction.Cash dispenser - The heart of an ATM is the safe and cash-dispensing mechanism. The entire bottom portion of most small ATMs is a safe that contains the cash.Sensing BillsThe cash-dispensing mechanism has an electric eye that counts each bill as it exits the dispenser. The bill count and all of the information pertaining to a particular transaction is recorded in a journal. The journal information is printed out periodically and a hard copy is maintained by the machine owner for two years. Whenever a cardholder has a dispute about a transaction, he or she can ask for a journal printout showing the transaction, and then contact the host processor. If no one is available to provide the journal printout, the cardholder needs to notify the bank or institution that issued the card and fill out a form that will be faxed to the host processor. It is the host processor's responsibility to resolve the dispute.Besides the electric eye that counts each bill, the cash-dispensing mechanism also has a sensor that evaluates the thickness of each bill. If two bills are stuck together, then instead of being dispensed to the cardholder they are diverted to a reject bin. The same thing happens with a bill that is excessively worn, torn, or folded.The number of reject bills is also recorded so that the machine o..."

558,"Technically not very different than a hedge fund.  Gather seed investment capital, and start investing - make decent returns - raise more capital - repeat.  However, that's where the similarities between HF and PE ends.  The actual investment process couldn't be more different.People often say that anybody can start a HF, and it's true, investing $10M in securities isn't all that different than investing $1,000.  Picking the right stocks can be very difficult however, so while getting a good performance is difficult, just getting the fund started is easy.PE is the opposite, it's easy to find right investments, but it's much harder to actually place the investment.Easier to make returns:Let's say I buy some shares of Apple, say $1,000,000 worth of stock.  Now, to make return, I just sit back and wait for the stock to pop - and cross my fingers the mgmt doesn't mess up.  And may be also pray that the board decides to increase dividend.  Obviously, this leaves lot of room for error, to make a good investment, not only does the financials and valuations need to make sense, but the key players - mgmt/board must do the right thing.  This is a lot to get it right.But, what if I give you full control of Apple after you invest the money.  So, say I invested the same $1M into Apple.  But this time, I can control the company's capital structure.  So, first thing I do after investing is payout the most of Apple's cash as special dividend, based on Apple's current cash holdings, it'd be about 20% of the market cap.  So, right off the bat, I get 20% of my original investments back.  Then I look at Apple's capital structure and see that it hardly has any debt.  Based on its FCF of $120B per year, Apple can easily issue $300B 5 year bond at low interest rates.  Take the $300B, then pay that out as dividend as well.  That gives you additional 60% of your original investment back.  So, now, all you invested in Apple is $200k, and you successfully minimized $1M investment's exposure down to $200k.  Now, your plan is to exit your investment at year 5, after you pay off your $300B bond - if Apple does exactly as well as it does today, no better or no worse, at year four, your investment should be worth $800k, and you'd have made 400% return on your investments in 5 years.  Not bad.  That's not all, to squeeze more juice and improve the financials around your exit time, you can stop much of long term R&D activities and save money, in the old days, you could also reduce salary and increase stock options, but GAAP put a stop to that practice by requiring options to be expensed right away.  Also, you can start selling parts of the company that the public doesn't care about, say Apple has a publishing arm that prints all its manuals, designs and makes packagings, it's likely that Apple's valuation won't be affected even if you sell it off.  So, you sell those units that the public doesn't know or care about, generating extra returns.  You can also fire a bunch of people particularly in non-production roles, this will improve your financials and you can generate higher valuation on your exit.  Then you sell the company by taking it public.  Of course, not all PE shops do this, and this type of activities were much more prevalent in the old days when people weren't aware of these tricks.  However, my point is that PE shops have lot of recourses to make their investments perform.  One more thing, PE managers also pay themselves fee when they close a deal, typically in 2-3% of the investment made.  This fee is paid right away and comes out of the fund.But harder to place an investmentThe difficulty is in actually closing a deal.  Let's say you somehow raised $100M and set up a PE shop without any experience in banking and without network of business managers and bankers.  Now, your job is to buy a company.  How do you do that?  Hiring a team of bankers is easy enough, and perhaps they can get you few meetings with company managements, but you'll hit an immediate road block there.  If you're the management of the company, when a PE approaches you, they're not only looking to be an investor in your company, but also trying to be your boss.  More often than not, PE will lay you off after they buy your company.  So, what mgmt often does is to talk to their board and investors that PE is bad news - if you have no credibility as a PE, it'd be rather easy for mgmt to brush off your attempts.  Even if you somehow get the mgmt to get on board by offering lots of severance and paying high premium in valuation, you probably still won't be able to close the deal.  Because, PE buyouts are typically leveraged buyouts - meaning that you need to borrow money to complete your purchase.  If you don't have cred in PE, not only bank syndicate will require higher equity ratio (which will destroy your economics) and higher rates, it probably won't go through - they don't like the risk of investing in a rookie PE shop.  This is the main reason why almost every single PE founders have very senior level banking experience, while HF founders have varied backgrounds from college dropouts to consultants to bankers to business owners.EDIT:  Let me be clear on one thing, buying $5-10M small business or startup venture is *NOT* what I'm talking about here.  Technically that's private equity too, but it really isn't.  I'm talking about $1B+ enterprise value private equity deal that involves syndicated leveraged financing."

564,"Four ways, basically:1. Ad revenue. When there's an ad on a video watch page, the creator of that video shares the revenue from that ad with YouTube. YouTubers aren't allowed to discuss ad rates, but it's generally acknowledged to be between $1 per 1,000 views, up to a few dollars per 1,000 views. Many YouTubers also make sponsored or branded content, in which they share or discuss a product for a fee. This can be very lucrative, but there's also the risk of clouding your authentic relationship with your audience.2. Merchandising. Many YouTube creators sell shirts or mugs featuring logos or inside jokes. There are companies designed for niche creators looking to make merch for their audiences (I co-own one, Don't Forget To Be Awesome). For some YouTubers, this can be a bigger source of income than ads (it is for my brother and me), but for most it's a relatively small business.3. Ancillary products. Many YouTubers are able to use their existing audiences as activation energy for other projects--from tours to music to makeup lines to books. Because many of these projects have better established business models (like, people generally expect to pay for books), this can also be a great business. It's unlikely my novel The Fault in Our Stars would've been so successful without the activation energy provided by the viewers of our videos.4. Subscription fees. This is an emerging business model, but I think a very promising one. Voluntary subscription platforms like Patreon: Support the creators you love allow viewers to support the creators they love directly. This decreases the influence of advertisers and makes creators directly answerable to their audiences. It does, however, require that a percentage of viewers choose to pay. I suspect most YouTubers make most of their money from ads, but I think advertising is probably shrinking percentage-wise as a revenue source, which I think is mostly good news. I think advertising is an important part of funding our online experiences, but ultimately I'd argue the Internet is healthiest when serving the needs of its human users rather than the needs of its corporate sponsors."

568,"There are numerous ways, the list goes.1. Start writing about the incidents of your life that you come across. It may be a conversation that you had with your parents, friends, teachers or debating news happening around the world in news channels. Write down about 2-3 incidents or stories daily.2. A good writer is a good reader. You need to read a lot of books. This would widen horizon and thoughts. Never stop reading. There exist numerous books to be read. Start with the books of your interest and then try to read the other books too which you haven't known about it well.3. A good writer is also a keen observer. Attention to details is very important whether it may be during writing or reading. Don't be a shallow reader.4. Carry a notepad with you. Whenever you come across an unknown saying or a word or an idiom or a thought, note down with examples. So that, you can start using it where ever it fits in your writing.5. Have an imaginative and creative thought while you write. To achieve that, you need to watch/read a lot of things. You can increase your creativity as much as you can by knowing about umpteen things whether it may be through a movie or a novel or a series. Grasp a lot of things that have been happening around.6. Think a lot, think deep and make a proper analysis about whatever you write.This much I can say as of now, hope you embark with it. Best of luck :)"
569,"Hare Krishna,There was no Big Bang. It is a great illusion created by mental speculation.The Universe is eternal, we are eternal, and there is no beginning or ending of us or the Universe.This has been confirmed in The Bhagavad Gita, which is a summary of all Vedic knowledge.“Material nature and the living entities should be understood to be beginningless. Their transformations and the modes of matter are products of material nature.” - Bhagavad Gita, Chapter 13, Verse 20.We merely change our forms in different lives. But we are eternal beings and the Universe is also eternal. Creation and destruction are merely change in forms. The Universe itself is eternal like us, but it is merely changing its form. The changes have been taking place since eternity and will continue till eternity. We all will exist in some form or the other eternally. And this whole Universe will also exist till eternity. This is the secret of existence.Never was there a time when I did not exist, nor you, nor all these kings; nor in the future shall any of us cease to be. - Bhagavad Gita, Chapter 2, Verse 12.Creation and destruction is simply an illusion.The Universe is existing and we all are existing. The Universe was existing, and we all were existing. The Universe will be existing, and we all will be existing always, forever, eternally. Our permanent identity is devotee of Sri Krishna, Sri Krishna's permanent identity is Supreme Lord. These identities never change in past, present, or future.Currently we all have forgotten our real identity as the devotees, as the associates of Sri Krishna. Therefore this knowledge of eternal life, eternal existence has been stolen away from us by Maya (illusion). This is the root cause of all confusion and suffering in this world. We have forgotten our eternal identity as devotees of the Almighty Lord.We just have to accept these true, eternal, permanent, non-changing identities, and then all chaos and confusion will end. Everyone will become perfectly enlightened.The only problem is that we don't accept our identity as devotees, associates of the Lord. Therefore Maya has captured us all, and we are wandering here and there in search of answers.Once we accept our true identity as the devotee, as the part and parcel of the divine Lord, Maya will lose her jurisdiction over us, and all answers, all knowledge will be revealed to us from within our heart, where Sri Krishna is already sitting as the paramatma (Super Soul).It is merely a question of recognizing the Lord, and accepting our eternal relationship with Him as associates and devotees. If we act in this world with such an attitude of devotion to the Lord, everything will be clearly visible to us. There will be no place for doubt, confusion, illusion, or ignorance. Maya can be wiped out completely by the grace of Lord Krishna.Even our scientists are beginning to find what Lord Krishna has already revealed: No Big Bang? Quantum equation predicts universe has no beginningWe, the devotees of Lord Krishna, know very well that Sri Krishna is the perfect scientist because He is God.He is the original Author of the Vedas, and He has perfect knowledge about everything. He has manifested this Universe from His energy, and He is the Supreme Lord.“I am seated in everyone's heart, and from Me come remembrance, knowledge and forgetfulness. By all the Vedas am I to be known; indeed I am the compiler of Vedānta, and I am the knower of the Vedas.” - Bhagavad Gita, Chapter 15, Verse 15.Therefore we simply accept His statements as true and avoid wasting our time. We utilize this time for doing Bhakti of Lord Krishna, the supreme scientist.Our recommendation to all intelligentsia in this world is - please stop wasting so much time, money and energy in mental speculation. Simply surrender to the Supreme Scientist, Lord Krishna. Chant His names, and you shall achieve all perfection and realize the absolute truth.Arjuna could see all the secrets of the Universe within Krishna's universal form, because he did not speculate. He surrendered himself to the supreme scientist Sri Krishna, and Sri Krishna blessed him with this vision -Bhagavad Gita, Chapter 11, Text 13tatraika-sthaṁ jagat kṛtsnaṁpravibhaktam anekadhāapaśyad deva-devasyaśarīre pāṇḍavas tadāSYNONYMStatra—there; ekastham—one place; jagat—universe; kṛtsnam—completely; pravibhaktam—divided in; anekadhā—many kinds; apaśyat—could see; deva-devasya—of the Supreme Personality of Godhead; śarīre—in the universal form; pāṇḍavaḥ—Arjuna; tadā—at that time.TRANSLATIONAt that time Arjuna could see in the universal form of the Lord the unlimited expansions of the universe situated in one place although divided into many, many thousands.PURPORTThe word tatra (there) is very significant. It indicates that both Arjuna and Kṛṣṇa were sitting on the chariot when Arjuna saw the universal form. Others on the battlefield could not see this form because Kṛṣṇa gave the vision only to Arjuna. Arjuna could see in the body of Kṛṣṇa many thousands of universes. As we learn from Vedic scriptures, there are many universes and many planets. Some of them are made of earth, some are made of gold, some are made of jewels, some are very great, some are not so great, etc. Sitting on his chariot, Arjuna could see all these universes. But no one could understand what was going on between Arjuna and Kṛṣṇa.Hare Krishna Hare Krishna Krishna Krishna Hare HareHare Rama Hare Rama Rama Rama Hare HareHare Krishna!To know more, just tune into this 24 hours Radio:Prabhupada Radio"

571,"Detailed Account of the UPSC Preparation from scratchI feel privileged today to share my two cents on civil services preparation. Before I begin let me clearly state that there is no magic wand to clear civil services. Also there is no correlation of intelligence and high aptitude with chances of selection in civil services. Most of the people who crack it are no indifferent (at one point of time even they were a part of the herd and felt the same uncertainty of clearing up this exam).But yes something worked for them, that made them successful.I would like to list down some of the most important components which you will find common in preparation of all successful candidates. We can call them as Basic Pillars of UPSC PreparationA timetable and strategy: Nothing is possible without proper planning, a daily timetable and short/long term goals setting. So plan and timetable is the first pillar.A strong foundation and conceptual clarity: it is important to ensure whatever we read, we understand it thoroughly. UPSC questions are very much applied, they need analysis and that can come only when we are crystal clear with our concepts of subject matter.Consolidation and revision: The syllabus is like a vast ocean, it is important to keep consolidating and revising it time and again. So make notes and continuously revise every now and then.Evaluation of Preparation: At every point of time you should know where your preparation stand, that is possible through self-evaluation and evaluation through tests.Consistency: Nothing happens without it. People who show consistency are sure shot to be rewarded, provided they work smartlyDiscussions and Answer writing: Discussions are very important, they will help in clearing your doubts & better understanding of subject matter. Similarly Answer writing has a very important role, knowledge without ability to express and articulate is futile. It is important to develop the ability to deliver in 8 minutes.Being Optimistic: This is the last but the most important one. UPSC is a time taking process, full of obstacles and failures. How to cope up with them, keeping yourself motivated is the biggest key to success.I will discuss each of the above point in detail sometime later. Also I shall take up discussion on soft aspects like right time to start preparation, should job be left, need of a backup, how do I decide why civil services etc. Clarity on all this is must before giving a full-fledged effort for preparation.Now let us discuss how to prepare for civil services.Pre –Preparation ModeThe initial two-three months are very confusing. People are generally not able to understand what to read, how to make notes, which newspaper to refer and other plethora of questions coming to their minds. What most people end up doing is they join a coaching thinking it to be a solution to all problems , others blindly start following some senior who himself is misdirected. This is a very crucial stage and I feel most of the people lose their momentum here because of a faulty start and they find very difficult to realign later.So starting has to be steady and sober. I think it is important to give at least two months to yourself to get yourself in UPSC mode. Start reading newspapers and noting them down, basic NCERT’s of economics, Polity & other basic ones, some good blogs/book etc. This will not only help in giving you a foundation but also help in taking informed decisions related to preparation (estimation of time you will need, need of coaching, should job be continued, optional choice etc.). This will act as a trial and error time where you can learn how to make notes, how to read books, learn from others etc. So this will make things smooth in your preparation be it self or through coaching.I shall discuss in detail how to go about in pre-preparation modePreparation ModeWhen you start your preparation, have..."

574,"It means that “while a lot of big changes appear to be happening, the real situation is that nothing important has changed much at all”. It gets used a lot to describe stuff that appears random in the short term, but follows the same pattern in the long term - like rainfall, or stock prices, but this use of the phrase (while valid and common) only captures the original meaning at surface value.In my opinion, to understand this statement you need to understand the origin. It was written (in French) by Jean-Baptiste Alphonse Karr in 1849 (plus ça change, plus c'est la même chose), the year after the French revolution (French Revolution of 1848 - Wikipedia) . As you might have guessed, French society and politics had seen a huge amount of upheaval - and a new president called Napoleon had been elected into office (and would shortly transform the republic into an empire). This probably sounded very familiar to Karr, given that this was the second time in 50 years that someone called Napoleon was forming a French empire just after a French revolution. Karr was a satirical writer, and the irony of two such similar revolutions occurring so close together, both promising to free the peasants forever clearly wasn’t lost on him. He penned the phrase ‘the more things change the more they stay the same’ (in french), to express his cynicism that the huge changes sweeping over France were going to lead to a genuine change in the country.So the phrase originally meant that “the huge changes that you often see happening in politics don’t represent real change, and are covering up the fact that the status quo in society tends to remains unchanged”.A cynical person on either side of politics may well think that the phrase is just as relevant today as it was over 150 years ago."
575,"To start with, I’d like to know for what purpose and which scale do you intend to start the business in the first place. On top of that, which kind of ‘business’ are you referring to? If what you meant was to sell electricity directly to the end-users, then unfortunately it’s impossible. In order to sell power produced by solar panels, you first need to register as an applicant before being evaluated by PLN, as the power purchaser. Unlike in the past, the procurement process is now conducted through ‘direct selection’ mechanism, and so you would need compete with many other applicants.Procurement process of all renewable plants, including solar power, should be carried out through an intricate, long, and complex procurement process. That being said, you need to liaise with PLN,as the sole provider of electricity. The electricity purchasing process itself is quite complex and require a complicated mechanism. As for solar plant producing power less than 10 MWp, the procurement can be carried out by PLN regional representatives, meanwhile as for solar plant producing power more than 10 MWp, the procurement process must be done by PLN’s headquarter office, DIVEBT to be precise.To make your move possible, you should first follow the pre-qualification process and you’ll be informed whether or not your application passed the PQ process as necessitated and the list of selected providers will be issued consecutively. Remember that the Power Purchase Agreement for solar plants is not more than 25 years after COD, this will be helpful in preparing all your important calculations; IRR, BEP, etc. As far as I’m concerned the bidding process is based on regional quota, for instance, it has been finalized that in Sumatera island alone the total capacity for bidding process will not be more than 168 MWp, all of which distributed in 115 separate locations.Last but not least, you will have to employ people who are highly knowledgeable and experienced in this sector (especially in price negotiation) and also, be aware of our ‘capricious’ regulations. Who knows if this year the procurement process will be changed.Wish you luck."

580,"He is the best candidate among the short listed four and is a continuity candidate.Few thoughts -Patel was the architect of RBI’s new inflation targeting regime and generally considered as hawkish as Rajan. Among the short listed, he was the most consistent supporter of using headline CPI as the nominal anchor. His appointment sends a clear signal that the current monetary policy regime will continue. Some weeks ago, Nomura in a research note[1] had published a “cheat sheet” of monetary policy stances of the candidates from the then much larger short list -Patel has worked at both central and state government levels in several departmental areas ranging from civil aviation, pension, telecom, competition commission, state electricity board and of course RBI. Unlike Rajan who was a career academic with a brief stint in IMF, Patel also spent some time in Indian private sector (Reliance). These experiences can only be an advantage.Much had been made of Rajan’s academic background in Indian media. Patel obviously is not in that league. I am not sure it matters that much. After all Rajan was the first ex-academic central banker India had. There had been many other very effective central bank governors in many countries who were career central bankers. And bear in mind that Rajan is quite an exception. There aren’t many other Indians at that level that the government can hire as RBI governor. Take a look here, - Economist Rankings at IDEAS, Number of Citations the top 5% economics authors by number of citations. Several years out of academia, Rajan is still there. There are only a handful of Indians there and most of them working in completely different areas.Patel will probably be more “RBI governor like”. Unlike Rajan, he will not use the RBI governor post as a bully pulpit to talk about crony capitalism in India, electoral malpractices, corrupt corporate leaders etc etc. He will not be as much fun but this will probably get him an extension after three years. That will be good.It is not clear whether Patel will continue with current RBI policy on clearing up bad debt from state banks’ books. During Rajan’s term RBI was very determined about that and the state banks had started showing quite an attitude change in recovering bad loans, pursuing defaulters etc. I never understood if it was mainly a Rajan project or had broad consensus within RBI.Footnotes[1] Your Raghuram Rajan potential successor cheat sheet"
581,"Excellent question! It’s a terrible job. You lose all privacy. Every aspect of your life and your family’s life and your personal history and your family history are exposed to public view. No matter what you do, somewhere close to half the population will hate you. There is no break or rest from the job — presidents who are on “vacation” are not really on vacation, they are just doing their job somewhere a little nicer than Washington, because the job follows them everywhere. No matter what, many lies will be told about you, and many people will believe those lies. The job is enormously stressful, and people who hold it seem to age very quickly.So with all of that, why would anyone want it?There are a lot of reasons. Some people are just wired to desire power, either because they want to use it to do good or solve problems, or because they want personal aggrandizement (and for many people it’s a little of both). If you spend your life in politics, being elected to various lower offices, the Presidency is the highest thing you can aspire to. And I think everyone, or almost everyone, who goes into politics is at least a little narcissistic; you have to believe that YOU are the best choice to lead the country. You basically have to be pretty sure that you are pretty special. So for some people, these things overwhelm the obvious downsides of the job."

584,"When you sleep, your brain is mostly occupied with decluttering , so your brain isn’t really in learning mode, so you are limited in the things you can actually learn during sleep.One thing is foreign languages. Studies show that if you play tapes or listen to foreign words when you sleep, your brain may absorb them. Germans who listened to Dutch while they slept and were later tested on some words did better with than those who did not listen to dutch.Another thing is musical skills. In one study, the study writers played and instructional tape from Guitar Hero over and over while people slept and it was found that those who heard the tape were able to play the melody better than those who did not.If you dream lucidly, you can learn a lot about yourself. Dreaming lucidly is when your body realizes that it is dreaming, and is able to control the dream. Analyzing your dreams can help you understand your motivations and also to face unresolved conflicts.You may be able to put a thought in your head before a dream, and if you dream lucidly, you may be able to find the answer to that question. New ideas can also arise during sleep. If there is a certain thing that you are having trouble with, focus on it intensely before sleep, you may wake up with the solution.I am going to send you link to some cool sleep products that you may like.Good luck and enjoy!All Products"

586,"The following answer is an excerpt from Acharya Prashant’s blog “ WORDS INTO SILENCE”Question: How to get rid of addictions like smoking, overeating?Acharya Prashant: Do you overeat when you are sleeping? Do you feel an urge to smoke when you are sleeping? Do you feel an urge to smoke, even when you are deep in relaxation? When do you feel like smoking?Listener: I have been drinking and it started when I was feeling depressed. But later on, drinking became a habit. Then you drink because you are happy, you drink because you are sad, you drink because nothing is happening, out of boredom.AP: Yes, but I still want to go into that.Do you still drink when you are sleeping? Do you drink in your deep moment of contentment? You said, you drink when you are happy, you drink when you are sad. Don’t you see, both of these are moments of excitement? Do you feel like smoking, when you are utterly peaceful? Does that happen?I am not talking of mere absence of activity. I am talking of peace. I am not saying that you are peaceful when there is nothing to do. When there is nothing to do, then you will be bored, not peaceful. And when you will be bored, then you will feel like smoking.Do you feel like smoking when you are peaceful? Do you? Is smoking the problem? Can you quit smoking as long as you continue to be what you are? Restless, peace less, excited, turbulent. But nobody ever comes to me and asks, “How to change life?” People come and ask, “How to quit drinking, how to quit smoking, how to give up on drugs?”Do drugs come, and insert themselves in your mouth? Does the cigarette, unwrap the pack, rise itself and comes to kiss your lips? Or do you go and buy the cigarettes? The cigarette does not buy itself. Who is the buyer of the cigarette, why not talk about him? It’s not smoking that you want to quit, you want to quit that mental state that necessitates smoking. And if that mental state keeps coming, you will continue to smoke. But you will never talk about that mental state because that mental state is related to “I” and our entire lifestyle.There might be people around you who make it compulsory for you to smoke. Not because they urge you to smoke, but because they put you in so much of tension, that you will need to smoke. But you are deriving some benefits from those people, so you will never ask, how to quit those people. Instead you will ask, how to quit smoking? Now, you can never quit smoking as long as you are with those people.It’s quite possible that those that you call as your intimate ones, are the ones that make it important for you to drink. The environment might be in the house, of a nature, that makes you so heavy, that you are forced to drink.L: The other aspect of drinking is that you want a high. And it gives you a high for a short time.AP: Who wants a high?L: Body, Mind. The Mind.AP: The Mind is nothing. The Mind is pair of opposites. The Mind lives in duality. Now tell me, who wants a high?Would you consider the hint? The Mind lives in dualities. The Mind wants only the opposite of where it is. So, who wants a high? The Mind lives in dualities, if the Mind is in one state, it wants to jump to the opposite one. So, if the Mind wants the high, what is the state of the Mind?L: It is low.AP: It’s low. Had you not been feeling low, would you want a high? Why don’t you go into this feeling of lowness? What makes you feel so low that you want a high? And why don’t you correct those factors?L2: Sir, my father used to have a cigarette at Four in the evening, after working so much he would say, “It is enough, let us have a cigarette.” I was watching it for many years and I also started doing that. Exactly at four in the evening after work, I started to say to myself, now it is enough of work, let me reward myself with a cigarette.AP: So, when work gives you a feeling of strain, then you want to celebrate the passing away..."
587,"A large portion of Britain's industry had been selling to, and supplied by, the Empire. Locomotives, bridge contracts, ships - major elements of infrastructure orders went on in the Empire's colonies.It was originally thought that the Commonwealth would continue this - i.e. maintain old trade links after independence was given back to the new nations. This completely failed to appreciate the effect of hugely subsidised Soviet trains, road vehicles, and items of essential infrastructure, which ended up becoming the industrial backbone of the new Commonwealth nations like India, Pakistan and much of Africa. Also, the expectation had been that the economies of many of these new nations would do a lot better after independence, than proved to be true in some cases. Britain's had always been something of a command economy, but it had been one underwritten by an imaginary veneer of profitability given to it by the Empire.British industry also tended to rely upon worker pride in the products they made, but large scale consolidation into ever bigger corporations during the Great Depression (that was accelarated in the face of ever declining profitability, after WW2), had meant that this asset - worker pride - was diluted by an ever declining involvement of those workers in the final product.Add to this, a singular failure to innovate in some of the core industries like motor, which led to designs originating from an age of large scale hand-assembly, being forced onto conveyor belt production lines, bored out and geared up to performance levels they had never been designed for - and you saw a rapid decline in reliability. British things were just getting to be a bit rubbish.There are, however, also plenty of examples of British industry pushing production out beyond the state of the art and paying the price for this adventurism. The De Havilland Comet springs to mind, in this regard - providing, as it did, valuable but costly learning, that later competitors would use to their own advantage."

589,"Creating the user interface for iOS apps used to be very easy in the past. Before the iPhone 5 there were just one phone size and one tablet size. With the introduction of the iPhone 5 there was a little bit more work to do, but the general philosophy did not change. But now you have also the iPhone 8, iPhone X and iPad Pro sizes so that it is not possible to layout absolutely anymore. Apple’s answers to this problem are size classes and auto layout.Generally speaking, these two tools have a lot of power so that it is possible to implement all layout requirements. But on the other side they are very difficult to learn. I believe this is the main reason for introducing Stack Views which are very similar to the Linear Layout in Android development.So I think it is very likely that Apple will introduce a complete new layout system in the future that is both powerful and easy to learn.The iPad Pro will change iOS development dramatically. Not because the development of apps will change as such. But the iPad Pro will make it possible to develop other kinds of apps.Although there are already very powerful apps on the iPad, it was not possible to develop apps that have the power to replace desktop applications like Adobe Photoshop because the screen size is too small. But the iPad Pro has a screen that is big enough for that kind of apps. Also the introduction of the Apple Pencil is a very important step because the user input with your finger tips is to limited for some use cases.The new Apple TV is a very important new device for the platform as well. The Apple TV used to be just a hobby for Apple, but with the introduction of the new Apple TV and the SDK this changed dramatically.It is very obvious how powerful a Apple TV SDK is. First of all, it is very similar to the iOS SDK. The main difference is that it lacks a webview. But besides from that it is very easy to adopt your existing iOS applications to the Apple TV. Also the creation of new apps will be very straightforward.So in my opinion the platform will grow dramatically in the future. Professionals like designers and photographers will prefer the iPad Pro over the laptop and consumers will love the Apple TV. That also means that there will be an even higher demand for iOS developers in the future.For more information About IOS please visit Omnist Techhub Solution"
590,"Well, I am 19, but I still feel I have figured out the answer to this question which I am going to share with you.First of all, speaking in a very discrete fashion, life makes no sense. We all will die one day (god forbid it, maybe this very moment) and would be just like before - nothing. It won’t matter if you lived the life of Elon Musk or some random dude (admitted, Elon has lots of problems of his own, but his life is idolised by the masses unlike yours and mine). So why make an effort for anything?Everyone among us does a variety of jobs/emotions everyday which you can classify as ‘I enjoy it’ (eating, sleeping, partying, watching movies, etc.) and ‘I hate doing it’ (studying for many, working, waking up to go to office, deadlines, accidental pains, loneliness, breakups, etc.).The quality of your life is determined by the sum total of above. Is the total number of things which you love doing more than those you hate? For most people this is not the case. They are too busy making both ends meet and making a secure future for themselves and their progeny. This is what makes them question their life. It is these people who feel life has no purpose mostly.So, were you better off if you weren’t created in the first place? Or you are better spending 80 years in the form of life where you would have to go through all these good and bad feelings and circumstances? This makes me wonder if life has no purpose at all. I mean, you are born, go through an education system for 20+ years (to fit in), and then do a job (and face lots of difficulties and failures in life), do the same with your kids, and eventually die. This makes me wonder if all this was a waste. But then, we get to experience so many good stuff in this journey (success, joy, travelling, knowledge, food, music, nature, etc.)So does life have a purpose?Depends on you. If you want to enjoy this beautiful gift and experience as many things as possible, do it now. Don’t wait for anything. You never know when you will die. You don’t want to regret not asking out that girl/ going for a trek/ learning the guitar/ completing your PhD in your afterlife (if it exists).If you are someone who is facing a lot of drudgery and all sorts of tragedies (true for most people at least in India and similar developing and underdeveloped nations. Believe it or not, poverty leads to lots of problems which leads to questioning the purpose of life.), then better try to find happiness in whatever you have, because a life without good things is worthless and a pain in the @$$. The quality of your life is more about your perception of it than what the society makes you believe. Even a person with no education, money or love can live happily. So why make it so bad? Enjoy it while you have it.The purpose of life - To live it in such a way that you don’t ask yourself this question when you die."
591,"Do you have any 'target' in particular? Or 'any IITian' will do?Okay, I'll answer for both. 1) A particular target.I assume that you know this target directly or through some mutual contacts. Either way, the path to victory is built by Zuckerburg. May be, just for this purpose. Who knows? Universe conspires. Anyway, steps:a) Befriend the target on FB.b) Make sure you have uploaded some really well photoshopped photos before messaging the target.c) Ask him any random thing. If you are not in college yet, ask him about JEE. If you are in college ask him about internship. In fact ask him any stupid shit on the planet. He will be happy to help. d) Don't overdo step (c) though. He might get bugged by a 'girl who just asks him questions.' Make sure conversation gets to non-academic, non-IIT topics soon. e) You wouldn't want your target to realise he's a 'target'. Take care of that.f) IITians have too much free time on their hands. And most of it is spent online. So be online all the time. Develop a really good facebook relationship.g) Next thing should be video chatting. Things become serious once you start video-chatting.h) Till this step, you are almost a 'potential'. Now to solidify things, ask him if you can attend his college fest. I have seen many romances blooming during those 4 days. e) If he agrees, celebrate girl. You have done 80% of the work right. Now go on and buy some really chic clothes. They'll add to the visual appeal.f) Make sure you do something intimate during the fest time. May be make him something or plan a date or some other 'couply thing'.g) If he hasn't confessed his never-ending love by now, he's just an idiot. So, go ahead and do it yourself.i) 'Self five' yourself for getting an ""IITan"" as a boyfriend.2)Any IITian Well, I just realised there isn't much difference in the strategy for any IITan and particular target.But, in this case the trick is not to look weird.So dig up any contact whose second or third cousin is an  IITian, or whose ex-ex or ex's ex is an IITian, or who is a friend of a friend of a friend of an IITian. Don't loose hope even if there are six such 'friends' in the above sentence. Read about Six degrees of separation to keep the search going.Once you find that one 'IITian', make him a target and follow steps (a) to (i).You are Welcome!P. S. - This answer is written by assuming you are a 'non IITian GIRL' in search of an IITian who still is in college. For real world IITians, this may not apply. But I don't have much experience about them. Wait for 6 more months though, I'll surely update this answer."

595,"As a mom of two who stupidly had children at a young age I will put in my two cents' worth.I got married two years after I graduated from high school, at age 19 1/2. I had gone to community college for a semester so only had a little bit of post-high school education under my belt.A couple of months after we got married my husband decided we should have a baby. Me being young and stupid thought it so sweet he wanted to have a family. Number one son was born a month after our first anniversary. Our second son was an “accident"" who was born 27 months after his brother.When I found out I was expecting again my husband was furious. We had been having some marital problems and a pregnancy merely exacerbated them. (At this time I would like to interject that if you're having marriage trouble DO NOT think that getting pregnant will improve the situation because it won't!)Anyway, John stated that the baby probably wasn't his. When he realized how stupid his comment was he then demanded I terminate the pregnancy, which was not an option. An innocent life should not be lost because of my mistake.When my boss found out I was pregnant she terminated me. John decided he wanted to party so I ultimately locked him out. There I was at 21, pregnant, unemployed and under-educated. Knowing there was no way I could get hired while I was incubating a baby I signed on for a six-month secretarial course. I qualified for welfare and got my son into preschool.I went back to work when my son was six months old because I didn't want to live off public assistance. It wasn't easy but we got by. I did get child support but I basically raised my kids alone.Now that I have laid out my sad tale my advice to women is first to stay in school, get a high school diploma, decide on a career path and then obtain the education required to become gainfully employed, whether it's through a four-year degree or vocational school. Not all jobs require a college diploma so don't waste your time on a stupid major and amassing student-loan debt if you really want to be an electrician.Give yourself some time to become proficient in your field, set aside money for savings and become financially solvent. I also recommend you be married and give yourself time to establish a household. Having spent 18 years as a single mom I feel I'm qualified to render an opinion on that. Kids do better with two parents. I am thankful my dad was around to set a good example for my boys and the three of them were very close.With all that said, in my humble opinion the ideal age to have children is in your mid to late 20s or early 30s when you're young enough and physicslly fit enough to enjoy them while being financially stable.I once worked with a woman who was having her first baby when she was 38. At that age I had one graduating from high school! My own sons did all the things I failed to do — they went to college, chose military careers and didn't start their families until their early 30s.I missed out on a lot because I spent my young adulthood caring for two small children. Would I have changed things if I could go back and do it again? Definitely!"
596,"It has always been considered impossible to achieve reliable, continuous welds directly between the two dissimilar metals, especially aluminum and steel.The easiest method is to use the ALUMA-Steel TIG Rod, developed - by welders, for welders -as a solution to a common problem encountered in the industry, a simple cost effective way to weld aluminum to steel.Prior to the advent of the above, welding aluminum to steel was carried out indirectly - but it is a complex process. Special techniques are required as brittle inter-metallic compounds are formed when metals such as steel, copper, magnesium or titanium are directly arc welded to aluminum. To avoid these brittle compounds, special techniques have been developed to isolate the other metal from the molten aluminum during the arc welding process. The two most common methods of facilitating arc welding of aluminum to steel are bimetallic transition inserts and coating the dissimilar material before welding.Bimetallic transition materials are sections of material that are comprised of one part aluminum with another material already bonded to the aluminum. This is done by rolling, explosion welding, friction welding, flash welding or hot pressure welding. These are readily available commercially in combinations of aluminum to such other materials as steel, stainless steel and copper. The arc welding of these steel aluminum transition inserts can be performed by the normal arc welding methods such as Gas metal arc-welding (GMAW) or Gas Tungsten arc-welding (GTAW). One side of the insert is welded steel-to-steel and the other aluminum-to-aluminum.Alternatively, a coating is applied to the steel part of the job, to facilitate its arc welding to aluminum. One method is to coat the steel with aluminum itself. This is sometimes achieved by dip coating (hot dip aluminizing). Once coated, the steel member can be arc welded to the aluminum member, if care is taken to prevent the arc from impinging on the steel. A technique must be used during welding to direct the arc onto the aluminum member and allow the molten aluminum from the weld pool to flow onto the aluminum coated steel.Coating the steel surface with silver solder is also another method. The joint is then welded using aluminum filler alloy, taking care not to burn through the barrier layer of silver solder. Neither of these coating type joint methods are typically depended upon for full mechanical strength and are usually used for sealing purposes only.Recently, a team of engineers at HONDA Japan developed a variation on Friction Stir Welding, in which metals are joined via mechanical pressure – it's the same technique that has been used for experimental steel/aluminum spot welds in the past. As Honda explains it, “This technology generates a new and stable metallic bonding between steel and aluminum by moving a rotating tool on the top of the aluminum which is lapped over the steel with high pressure.” It is claimed that the welds that result are as strong or stronger than those made using regular Metal Inert Gas welding.Another engineer in Austria uses a special solder and torch just hot enough to melt aluminum but not steel. The process, called cold metal transfer, a breakthrough in welding technology, employs an argon gas to avoid oxidation. The steel is coated with zinc to bind the steel, solder and aluminum.There is an interesting video that shoes how aluminum to steel welding is done:Hope that helps!"

599,"If you ignore reality, anything can happen. You could come out the other side as Sponge Bob.Seriously, first you would have to figure out how to pass the center of the earth without being vaporized by the intense heat in the center of the earth. If the hole is wide enough that you can have a perfect free fall, I believe without air resistance you would accelerate indefinitely until you reach the center of the earth, then you would start to slow down and by the time you get to the other side your speed would be close to zero. Now with air there is a problem. You would accelerate in free fall until you reach terminal velocity and your speed doesn't increase anymore. Once you pass the center you will again slow down but your speed wasn't that great to begin with so you reach zero way before you get to the other side. From that point you start free falling back to the original place, but again, air resistance will be such that you will stop closer to the center of the earth every time, like a pendulum that is slowly losing energy with every pass until you stop at the center and live there forever.Of course I'm just speculating…."
600,"Planting a garden. Yes, you have to work for it but you are using your energy to collect the only free energy known, that of the sun. It is not free if you collect it via a solar panel, you can't store it without using energy from other sources that are not free and even then the storage time and capacity are limited.Some will suggest that wind, tidal and water flow provide free energy. What energy they have is tied back to that same sun and none of it can be harvested for free. Even solar, if it is to be used for anything beyond gardening, will not be free. Solar oven? You have to create the oven and for any effective use, the material required will need other energy for manufacture. The same basic problem lies at the beginning of any energy use effort.Still, planting fruits and vegetables, especially those better eaten raw, is the only “free” energy for you. And it is very good exercise as well."

603,"To determine phenotype ratio, the most likely course of action would be sampling. That is, you take a (hopefully) representative portion of the population you are trying to figure out the phenotypic ratio of, and just count which ones exhibit each allele. With the phenotype ratio, you could use Hardy Weinberg to find the genotypic ratio. This only works if the population is in Hardy Weinberg equilibrium*.Basically,The sum of the dominant and recessive allele ratios must equal 1. (Because that's all of them)A + a = 1Hardy Weinberg says that you can ""square"" both sides to find a relationship for the genotypic ratios. AA + 2 Aa + aa = 1You can plug in your recessive phenotype ratio you obtained from sampling into the equation, and solve.Ex: Say you found that .64 of a population has the dominant trait, while .36 of the population has the recessive trait. aa = .36AA + Aa = .64You sqrt(aa) to find a.a = sqrt(.36) = .6Thus, 60% of the alleles in this group are the recessive. 40% are dominant.

604,"I think everyone knows slow nature of Saturn so the question is more about why Saturn benefits the house where it sits and harms the 3 aspected houses .In Sanskrit , there is a Quote स्‍थान हानि करो जीव:, स्‍थान वृद्धि करो शनि: which means Jupiter harms the house where it sits but helps where it aspects while Saturn helps where it sits and harms where it aspects.The answer lies in the working of the two planets . Jupiter is for growth, grants , donation and benevolence so it ignores its own benefits and focusses outward . It is like budget sanction by top mangement , which everyone likes.Saturn is more for reforms , discipline so it adds value by reforms in implementation .Saturn is like an auditor reaching to an office , taking time to find loopholes , unfair practices , reporting them to top management and forcing reforms in working of that Department , finally increasing efficiency.Though auditor finds errors at one office and reforms it , his recommendations report is sent to all offices , so its aspect also cause reforms."

607,"Bear with me because 10 is a very large number for a list! As a film fanatic, you’d want a variety of movies to watch of different genres incorporating the many different types of techniques to showcase a movie! Without further ado, a list of movies you must watch as a film fanatic:Citizen Kane (1941) : Often hailed as the best movie ever made, this is a movie you MUST watch if you’re a film fanatic. Orson Welles was a pioneer of filming and created many amazing techniques that were revolutionary for his time! A great start on your journey.Psycho (1960): Alfred Hitchcock, along with Welles, is among the pioneers of early filmmaking! This movie was considered a controversy at the time of its release because of it’s unique story line that killed off the main character! Also, the ending caused the American audience to develop a love for thrillers!2001: A Space Odyssey (1968): No list is complete without adding the genius, Stanley Kubrick. I could’ve chosen any of his movies, but I’ve chosen this because of his usage of visual cues. Although made in 1968, it’s amazing visual effects transcend movies released decades later!The Gold Rush (1925): One of the earliest forms of comedy movie, Charlie Chaplin at his finest. Absolute genius of an artist and it’s hilarity still ensues to this day! Not only was he a director, but he was also the actor!‘The Shining’ (1980): One of the greatest horror movies ever created. Not only is it bewilderingly scary, but the plot is riveting, acting amazing, and once again, great usage of technology at the time. Stanley Kubrick is a wonderful director to study!‘The Godfather’ (1972): Another classic movie that is a must-watch! This movie is highly influential in the movie industry. And is often a reference for many gangster related movies! Amazing movie to watch and heart thumping with each death!‘Do the Right Thing’ (1989): One of the best Spike Lee films, it’s a movie that delves into race. Very important topic to watch because all cultures offer different aspects to movie-making! Thought this was one of the best movies made by Lee before he went too artistic!‘Saving Private Ryan’ (1998): One of the greatest war movies, it’s action-packed and filled with many emotional journeys. This is one of the best action movies ever created and you will be at the edge of your seat as you watch this movie! Also, the acting and the cinematography is amazing in this movie. Truly fits the atmosphere of war.‘Lion King’ (1994): One of the best, if not, the best, animated movie ever made, this is one for all ages. You can learn so much from this film, especially music and its importance. One of the most recognized soundtracks and has amazing artwork for the landscape. Story line is one of the easiest to follow and fall in love with.‘Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind’ (2004): One word: screenplay. Has the most amazing lines in any movies. Due to Charlie Kaufman being its screenplay writer, this movie’s lines can easily make you cry!I’m sure there are plenty more, but I personally believe a these movies are the cornerstones of any film-watchers!"
608,"Here is the state of the world now (only highlights).North Korea- Has missiles and Nukes in its stockpile. Their missiles do not have enough range to reach continental US. Even if they somehow manage to strike a few Nukes at the US, it will only affect the impact zones immediately. So it will result in the total wipe out of NK in the US’s retaliation. North does not want to nuke the south coz their first goal is to take over the south and unite the Koreas. It does not want to attack any of its neighbors simply because there are no compelling reasons to do so for North. So there’s no real threat.Russia- She has a lot of technologically advanced weapons. Some even better than the US. She has a stock pile of Nukes and intercontinental ballistic missiles. But they have one thing working against them. Their own economy. Their economy is weak. They cannot keep the supplies alive to support an all out war or an invasion. No place can be dominated or occupied without boots on the ground. So there’s no real threat.China- She has the largest army. Lot of hardware, strong economy, many missiles and long history as well. What is working against them is their size and their political leadership. Most of the weapons in their arsenal are old and reverse engineered stuff from the Soviet era. They are modernizing however, but not at the rates they want. Also their navy and air force does not have enough hardware to back an invasion. So no real threat.India- Certainly a large number of people, large army. Relatively modern Air force and Navy. India is historically peaceful and non-aggressive they have stood their ground against aggressors but never pushed back. Also the air force does not have the infrastructure to support an invasion. Navy has inadequate number of modern vessels. Submarine fleet is aging. Modernization is happening at a snail’s pace. Political leadership is not helping with the process either. So no real threat.Europe- Collectively, very powerful and has strategic advantage over the rest of the world due to sheer strength and size of hardware of individual members and the collective strategic knowledge and experience. However, Europe is not as united as they wish to be. Member nations have trust issues with each other due to leftover emotions from previous two world wars. Also there is an impending financial crisis and a social crisis due to the refugee movement. So no real threat.Africa-Individual nations(some of them) may be strong enough to defend own territories against invaders, however none of the African nations are strong enough to launch a war or an invasion against even their Asian neighbors; let alone European or American. Also, most of the continent is torn apart by countless civil wars, racial and tribal conflicts and regional disputes. There is not enough reasons for an outward spill-over of the conflicts. So no real threat.South America- Same as Africa. Third world countries, slow or crippled economies, poverty, smaller, largely inadequate military forces. There are no compelling reasons for them to cause a large scale conflict, let alone global. So no real threat.Middle East- There are a few who can put up a real tough fight against an invading foreign military.Their situational awareness, familiarity with terrain and guerrilla tactics are all advantageous but only works withing the region so they are only good at defense. Certain countries possess good hardware and moderately large modern armed forces. However, none of the Middle Eastern countries possess the military strength to lead an invasion on foreign land or sustain the defense of their own territories for a long time (including Iran). Also they are not synonymous with the modern equipment that they possess. This is because of lack of experience in large scale multi-face, multi-theater warfare and lack of trust between troops. This seriously undermines the collective efforts. So no real threat.Last but not least,USA- Uncle Sam checks off all items on the list when it comes to size, numbers and weaponry. Certainly strong, economy wise. Has a global reach and has lead countless invasions, successfully. They are already the dominating force and has a firm hand of control over the world with many military bases in strategic locations across the entire planet. She is ruling the world now, at least by a big margin (Economically, politically and strategically). So she wouldn’t do anything that would start a third world war and cause a global meltdown. Because once the world goes in to the chaos of war, the balance of power might tip against them. Off course she will get involved in many other small scale conflicts, trying to bring down a dictatorship or install a new one, home-delivering freedom and democracy to the needful. Still, no real threat.Unless something dramatic plays out anytime soon or some nut job decides to let some nukes loose willy-nilly, we are certainly not heading towards a third world war. So just relax and have a cold beer."

613,"Arnab Goswami is Pro-INDIA.He is a person, who wanted to quit journalism, at one instance in his life when he just started his career because he was fed up of Lutyens Delhi, he hated the system of mutual cooperation, sycophancy and corruption in media. It made him feel so sad that he regretted ever being a journalist. So this disruption is born out of the human necessity to change things.He never supported submissive journalism, that other media houses always did. We have always seen journalism as a whole idea of being neutral, this neutrality is a sham. It is not only meant to provide the information but to create the positive impact that is needed in our society. It was detached to people's day to day issues, that we face. He is the one who started to create impact, to ask the questions about the previously ignored issues which no other journalist dared to do.People who accuse him of being pro-BJP should remember the fact, when he broke the Lalit Mode Scam, within 15 minutes of the story Sushma Swaraj had to admit that she helped Lalit Modi. Then he discussed corruption made by Vasundhara Raje in Rajasthan for 15 days in a row in primetime. Then came Vyapam Scam and a series of debates were held over this. In summers of 2016, when there was the drought in Maharashtra, he took the issue and criticised BJP govt. for the ignorance and insufficient measures to fight this huge problem and as a result both central and state govt came into action.In 2011, Manmohan Singh, the then Prime Minister, called for a press conference, (Yes! you read it correctly :P , he decided to speak once), all the editors who were invited were asking really irrelevant and unimportant questions like their message to Sachin Tendulkar (who scored a century last evening), no one dared to ask questions about Coal Gate, 2G Spectrum Scam, Augusta Westland Deal, CWG Scam, Adarsh Scam, Aircel-Maxis case which all were the burning issues at that time, he was the one who asked the question about infamous Devas-ISRO Deal, which was a big scam happened right under the nose of Mr Prime Minister, for which PM answered ""Compromises needed in coalitions"". For this question, he was stopped by some bouncer over there, to behave with Prime Minister.Media is not a Wikipedia, and the idea to remain neutral is rubbish in itself. Neutrality is never going to create an impact, and journalism is an exercise that is absolute futility in the absence of impact. When there are facts right before you, when you can see the White and Black, so why to sit in the middle, to be neutral? Who can be neutral on Yakub Memon knowing the fact of his involvement in the killing of 257 people in 1993 attacks in Mumbai, It takes a backseat of the argument of human rights of Yakub Memon. So as in the JNU row, what is the point to remain neutral when you know the difference between dissent and nationalism?He is a JOURNALIST, not a part of dirty vote bank politics, who can't take a firm stand with the fear of losing the vote bank. I am happy that he is not a weak and hypocrite media person, and he quit to form a new media house ""Republic"", that will not have the stake of any politician and will become the voice of the nation."

618,"I'm not an Indian but still I'll like to share some points by which Indians must be ashamed of.Kind-hearted Indians-On Feb 14, Pakistan based terrorist group J-E-M killed 44 Indian soldiers and the brutality was so high that not even a single soldier was in one piece. After next day another blast, A major got matryed and by this time every Indian was like “Go to war with Pakistan” “Drop nukes,we don't care if we die” “Give us guns and we'll fuck Pakistan” , everyone wanted war and carried out rallies but after two weeks India carried out a strike in Pakistan killing almost 300 terrorist (claimed by India) and Pakistani airspace in return tried to violate Indian airspace but failed and during this mission one of the IAF pilot crashed landed in POK and got arrested! Every Indian was demanding for his release and finally he was released, as soon as he was released everyone was like “Imran khan is my lord” “Thank you Pakistan” “Say no to war” and literally everyone was thanking Pakistan and none realised the fact that it wasn't that Pakistan wanted peace but they had to release him under conventions and Pakistan was also facing International pressure so they had to. Also that day when IAF pilot was released two Indian soldiers and two cops were killed in cease fire by Pakistan military but no one cared about it as everyone was busy thanking Pakistan thinking that Pakistan literally wants “Peace” and everyone now wants peace, they forgot about Pulwama when none of the soldier was sent home in a “single piece”. So kind hearted Indians are. They didn't get it that Pakistan had to release him as there was no fuckin other chances , many people also said that the “revenge is taken” maybe it's taken but remember they lost Terrorists and no one cares about them but you lost soldiers.2: Indians believe in their government very much-After the surgical strike many Indians were like “where's the proof?” “ was it real?” “How they counted bodies?”Bruh the body count was an estimation as the area which was selected for strike prolly had large number of militants. No one even knows how many soldiers died in pulwama, some sources say 44 and some 40 some 50.3: Indians blames other's easily:When IAF pilot was captured he was asked where he's exactly from in India and he denied to answer but Indian Media was like “we are outside pilot's house and all stuff they revealed about him” but nowadays mostly people don't watch news, they simply depends on Twitter or Instagram or Facebook and get to know current news from social media pages, when Media revealed IAF pilots identity no one even knew but after that Indian memers made memes likeAnd these memes kept on circulating and got viral, everyone got to know about him. Admit it you also got to know about it from such memes only,right? And people were just blaming media while they played more role in revealing his identity.Edit 1:People are commenting that the 1st point is wrong, no one thanked Pakistan, ok so here's proof:Credit goes to Nitin Singh for the screenshotEdit 2:I got that tweet translated from my Indian friend→ Any hate or abusive comment will be deletedCheck it out:WWE- Narendra Modi vs Imran Khan {Must watch}"

620,"I think the word “best” is too loaded a term, but if I were to answer, what single work of music is perhaps the greatest cultural product of a single mind? Then I would have to answer, no contest, Beethoven's Symphony No. 9 in D Minor, known also as the Choral Symphony.Sure, it's very popularity can be a negative, as it seems almost cliché to cite this work, but nothing else, in my estimation, achieves what Beethoven manages to achieve here: through sheer force of will (or maybe he was just paying attention), he manages to claw his way up to catch a glimpse of Heaven, then shares with us what he saw.Some might disagree with me, citing Beethoven's mighty Fifth Symphony, an astounding work of unsurpassed originality. But the Fifth only really achieves greatness in its first movement; while the third is delicious, and the fourth a compelling and triumphant ending to the work, they are not at the same level (and the second movement… never been a huge fan).In the 9th Symphony, we are treated to four remarkable movements, united by an overarching story line about the evolution of humanity. Which is why, in the fourth movement, Beethoven recalls the themes of each of the preceding three movements, only to have the basses, the voice of God, reject each as inadequate to the task. Instead, the Ode to Joy theme is introduced, first by the basses, then with the other lower strings (and the loveliest bassoon counterpoint ever written), then the full strings, then the full orchestra, with timpanis pounding and French horns blaring (the sure sign that Beethoven is happy)—to my mind and my ear, the most emotionally moving development of a musical idea you're ever going to find, triumph written large.Beethoven then introduces a human voice—the first for a symphony—which leads ultimately to the full chorus, which is followed by a Turkish-inspired march and a thrilling passage of musical development, leading to the coda and the full-throated singing of the Ode to Joy theme.And then something remarkable happens. Beethoven breaks with the classical structure that, however stretched, still gave form to this work, and enters into some of the most emotionally moving music ever composed, a plea to all of us to question what we know and seek our Creator beyond the canopy of stars. Though other composers had begun writing in the form we know today as Romantic, the abrupt shift in the music here is the visible, visceral break, the end of the Classical, and the emergence of the Romantic.There's more to it, of course, but in the end there is no musical ride that compares with this one. Sure, works written in the two centuries since have built on and far exceeded many aspects of what Beethoven composed, but these works stand on the shoulders of giants, and in particular a grumpy, grouchy, deaf guy who achieved the near impossible. It is for this reason that I say that classical composers may be properly understood to fall into two groups: Beethoven, and everyone else."
621,"Hungary is a durable country.For generations Magyarorszag served as a barrier between Asian steppe and the civilized Europe. In 1241 it was devastated by the Tatar onslaught. However, due to the prudent policy of King Bela IV country rebuilt its ruined castles and introduced armored cavalry which could resist penetrating force of Mongols' arrows. As a result, when, starting in 1285, next waves of Mongols-Tatars had invaded Hungarian flat lands they were successfully repelled this time.In XVI-XVII centuries Hungary was again on a front line in the conflict between the East and the West. Turks conquered Buda in 1541 and divided the country into three parts. Nevertheless, in 1718 Hungary was again free from Ottoman rule ending a long liberation journey which started in 1686 by Holy League's army (an alliance organized by Pope Innocent XI to oppose Turks) reconquering Buda.In XXth century Hungary took the wrong side of both World Wars. As a part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire it got defeated by Entente forces but not militarily. Romanian attack into Transylvania and Russian (Brusilov) Offensive came largely in fault and the Empire ended the war by Karl Franz Joseph Ludwig Hubert Georg Otto Marie (Charles IV) signing Padua armistice on November 1918 after uprising in the army and factories' strikes made it futile to resist. Years of revolutions, civil wars, economic hardships and Hungarian national uprising followed. As a result, populist figures such as Ferenc Szalasi rose to power. Not learning its historical lesson, Hungary entered the Second World War on the side of the Third Reich on 26 June 1941.After the defeat of the Nazis, Hungary was invaded by the Red Army and later subdued to Stalinist government sponsored by the Soviet Union. However, Hungarian people didn't like the totalitarian regime too much, and, on October 1956, most of the country revolted against Moscow appointed rulers. After some deliberation, Nikita Khrushchev (USSR leader) had sent 150,000 soldiers and 2,500 tanks to crush the uprising and later installed in Hungary Moscow appointed Janos Kadar to lead the new government. However, Hungary could not longer be ruled by red dictators. Magyar Szocialista Munkáspárt, MSzMP introduced a number of free-market reforms in 1968 (named the New Economic Mechanism) which converted Hungary to the most prosperous country in the socialist Warsaw Block. Ironically, Hungary was then called ""the happiest barrack"" in the Socialists camp.After Soviet Union collapsed the capitalist economy came into full force in Hungary as it did in other former Pact's states. As in other East European countries the level of living for majority of population dropped sharply after that. It led to the Magyar Szocialista Párt - MSZP rise to power. Socialist party dominated Hungarian political scene until 2010 when Viktor Orban's nationalists Fidesz – Magyar Polgári Szövetség got 114 seats (more than two-third) in the Országgyűlés (199-members Parliament). The largest opposition party - MSZP - has now 29 seats in it.Hungary has a well diversified economy with such industries as food processing, electrical goods, motor vehicles, pharmaceuticals and tourism leading in its GDP structure. GDP growth rate is currently under 1%. However, unemployment rate dropped from 11% in 2008 to 6% in 2016.Hungary became a member of the European Union in 2004 and today it attracts criticism from other EU members for its non democratic style of governments. It's stated that Orban has sacrificed basic civic freedoms (that of speech and popular protests) to achieve political stability and to improve economical indicators of the country.There are now different projections concerning the political future of Hungary but we can be certain that this country which profession is to survive will endure through that historical phase as well as it did through all previous ones"
622,"Zilch. Nada. Nothing.There is no intrinsic purpose to life, that one must do this, or that you were created for that.This may seem depressing, but it is an inevitability. We live in a world of opportunities, and the reality is that seizing these opportunities and physically making a change is the only difference between those whom find purpose in life and those who don’t.Now another point to be made is the reasons that people ask this question:Often people who are depressed, or under distress [due to their financial situation, or other reasons], will ask this question because nothing seems to go their way, and they are losing hope, so they ask this question because they want to know if there is a supernatural way to get out of this, as for them they seem to be unable to do anything.Equally, other people ask this question because they don’t enjoy the career that they do, or the life that they life, so they ask this question because they feel tied to a monotonous life which is not theirs. As if they are destined for more.Some people ask this question due to their religion, which attempts to explain these issues, and especially as science is still plodding through methodically trying to find a concrete explanation. They are generally looking for answers, because their life cannot provide them.In either scenario, everyone wants what they do not have, and are looking towards the supernatural or the “universe” to answer their question and do what they are unable to do.From this, the real meaning of this question is a self-examination of ones life and priorities, which have revealed some deficiencies and decisions that were made unnecessarily and/or without a clear purpose, and after the consequences of these one is trying to re-evaluate, considering that the divine may be able to bring the change that they could not.The point of life is: live your life the way you want, not anyone else wants. Pursue your goals, and to hell with anyone who comes in your way.For more, follow here."

626,"I would like to complement Maya Las answer with some information about the situation in Sweden. First hand information.In my city, Sundsvall, we have a refugee camp that has been around for 35 years. It is quite OK. It is an old mental hospital that was closed down when moden psykofarma made it obsolete. Refugees lives in apartments of several rooms, used to be one refugee in every room and a shared kitchen. Low standard but much higher than anything offered to swedish military conscripts. Then in 2011 the Swedish government made an agreement with Miljöpartiet that ment:All refugees that claimed to be from Syria were to be granted asylum Any refugee that claimed to be a child was to be considered a childRefugees that was denied asylum were to be allowed to stay in refugeecamps and be granteed housing, food and pocket money until they decided to leave.This agreement had consequencies that no one could have predicted (source: the Swedish government). For example: our refugeecamps were crowded. New refugeecamps were established. We runned out of abandoned military baracks and mental hospitals. Other abandoned buildings had to be used. This ment that refugees were housed in of side buildings with low standards. Sweden has a lot of empty space but it is uninhabitated by a reason (think Siberia).Many refugees are now very disapointed when they are housed in abondoned buildings in the middle of nowhere. In Timrå there are some military baracks indended for temporary use were refugees are housed. The refugees have been protesting against living there.Then when we runned out of baracks in the forrest new alternatives had to be found. In Sundsvall we now have refugees living in sports hall. Sleeping on the floors. The situation is creating problems. Different refugees are mixed and conflicts occures. Imagining Shia muslims and Sunni muslims living together. People are being killed and raped. This could also not have been predicted: When arriving to Sweden all refugees were supposted to end their conflicts and live in peace and harmony in Sweden (why dont they just shake hands?)Some refugees are also very disapointed and refuse to leave their buss when arriving to the new low standard refugeecamps. This is very chocking for Swedes. We are expecting the refugees to be greatful and the standard of living is still higher than we had as military conscripts, but we did not have to share room with traumatised people whos language we did not understand, we had a limited time to live in tents in the cold Swedish winter and so on. .....Now the swedish government are doing adjustments in our refugeepolicies. We are now becoming die hard strict instead of super generous  "

628,"If you’re questioning it, that’s not a good sign. If they love you, you will know. They want you in their lives and they put you there. They genuinely care about your well being. They support you and want you to be successful and happy. All couples need time apart to keep things healthy so if that’s the case, don’t worry. Most people on this planet cannot spend 24/7 with ANYONE and not get annoyed and frustrated so time apart is good. It’s good to miss each other. You may want to sit down and have a chat with them if you’re not sure where the relationship is going. If you’re just having cold feet and need reassurance, you have to talk to them."

In order to build a rapport with someone - whether you’re working or managing your home affairs - you need to know what other people are saying; they are not just sharing their opinion, but valuable information too, which is very essential for you to do something. Do not switch off when someone is talking to you.Be observantPresence of mind basically implies concentration and focus. Lack of focus and a distracted mind are signs of low presence of mind. While someone is doing something and you need to be able to understand or replicate that, it is very significant that you observe them carefully. If you do not observe, it might cost you.Don’t carry emotional baggageAs a human being, it is natural that you cannot completely compartmentalize your life. You have personal problems which become so unbearable that you think about them even while you are at work. You are lost, unable to focus, and make errors. You need to train yourself that you cannot afford to make mistakes here. At least, you must have control over certain things in your life.Chill outStress takes a toll on the brain by washing harmful chemicals over the hippocampus and other brain areas involved in memory. Some scientists suspect that living a balanced lifestyle and pursuing relaxing activities such as yoga, socializing and crafting, may delay memory impairment by reducing stress.Let go of perfectionismExpectation of perfectionism creates tension in you and in others.

632,"A healthy CIBIL report and a chance to get a loan will increase. According to research data analysis based on CIBIL (Credit Information Bureau (India) Ltd., 79% credit and credit cards of credit and credit cards have been approved for individuals 750 and above.The first step towards developing a healthy CIBIL report is to understand its contents. One of the most important components of the Credit Report is the ""Accounts"" section. This section contains all the debts and credit cards details including creditors type, type of loan facility (home, auto, personal, overdraft, etc.), account numbers, ownership details, date opened, last payment date, loan amount, current balance and Monthly record of your payments (up to 3 years). This section also provides ""status"" in the account which defines the ""health"" of the account. A person's credit report and they mean that there are some common status flags here:Closed: If you find a date near the 'Closed' field in your account section, the loan account is closed with the lender. In other words, you can pay your loan completely and report this account as ""closed"" to CIBIL.After closing the loan, it is very important to get the No Deals Certificate (NDC) from the lender, banks issue a No Dee Certificate (NCD) or Closing Letter, Closing the Debt and ""Covered"" to your CIBIL Report.Settlement: If you have partially repaid debt or credit card or credit card, then the status in your credit report is ""settled"". When you have an account settled, the credit company agrees to accept the minimum payment amount on the original payment amount. As the lending institution loses the risk, the ""settled"" status can be considered negative and the possibility of loan approval is considered to be detrimental.Your CIBIL TransUnion score does not affect the ""Settlement"" flag, your credit history will show a ""settled"" status in your CIBIL report and reflects Day-Past-Deu because the loan payment is not timely. Each bank has its own policy of looking at a ""secured"" status and determines your future loan applications.Written Off: When you can not pay more than 180 days for an outstanding loan/credit card, the lender will require a ""Write-Off"" in question. The lender then reported on your CIBIL report as ""retained off"". A lender who is willing to give credit or credit card to those who do not repay their debts or credit cards is a risk of approval for your loan or credit card applications.If the CIBIL report shows a ""settled"" or ""written off"" status, then the person may be harder to get a loan.""Finance ready"" helps you understand the points in your credit history and work them to better cibil report and build a score.The number of reports to be paid by the CBIL report is between Rs 550 and Rs 1200. For companies, CIBIL reports a flat rate every time and charges 3000 a company request for a score."
633,"The question of what constitutes Tolkien's canon is considerably more contentious than Balrog wings.The Hobbit is a work written by Tolkien and published in his lifetime; it is therefore canon in that sense.It became, in the process of being written, connected to older and greater stories Tolkien had written and would continue revising until his death in 1973.The Lord of the Rings was written with the intent that it be a sequel to The Hobbit. It is canonical in that sense.There are however a host of issues to consider. Should we consider the 1st, 2nd or 3rd edition as canon? How do goblins late in the Third Age recognize swords from the First Age? ""Tra-la-la-lally here down in the Valley,"" WTF!? Dogs serving as waiters to a were-bear, cockney talking purses, huh?There is a subset of fans who want to be able to say that this is canon and that is not. This character would definitely beat that character in a duel. This Ring would affect that character in exactly this way. Elves could see a great distance because of these specific genetic differences. In my mind this is trying to hold Middle-earth to a standard that is completely unrealistic. However we might wish it to be, Middle-earth and the tales surrounding were a work in progress that Tolkien never finished to his own satisfaction.We, as fans, have had the good fortune to have Christopher Tolkien provide us with a vast collection of his father's unpublished work; along with his own insight and opinions regarding same. This cornucopia of source material however makes it sometimes easy to lose sight of the fact that we are talking about a fairy-tale.My own view is that there is a spectrum of  ""canonicity""  rather than a strictly defined canon. I would place The Hobbit ""lower"" than Lord of the Rings but ""higher"" than much of what is published in The Return of the Shadow (HoMe Vol VI) i.e. Bingo Baggins and Trotter. My own general rule of thumb is to look for the composition date of material in question and to accord greater weight to work written at a later time, but even this rule has exceptions."

635,"This trek is of Easy-to-Moderate intensity. Starting point for the trek to Har Ki Dun is Taluka village (2110 m, 6922 ft). Trail runs along the tributary of Tons river and has few steep climbs and descents. Round trip trek duration is 4-days. Distance from Taluka to Seema (13  Km) is covered on the first day, and from Seema to Har Ki Dun (12 Km)  is covered on second day. Trekkers usually camp at Har-Ki-Dun for one or  two nights. Return route is same as the onward route and also completed  in two days. If trekkers are habituated to trekking long distances (~  20 Km) in one day, they can attempt return journey from Har Ki Dun to  Taluka in one day.The trek takes you to a completely different world which is so close  to the nature and completely free from any kind of gadgets! Beautiful  vistas, unfolding in front of your eyes, are a visual treat. It makes  you appreciate beauty of the Himalayas and the mother nature. This is a  ‘must do’ trek for every nature lover !Fitness:This trek requires endurance. Although it is an easy trek, it can be  quite hard on your knees if you are not accustomed to long distance  (~20-25kms in a day) trekking or walking. Start basic fitness and endurance building at least  2 months prior to trek. You can daily jog for 30 to 40 mins or go out for long duration brisk walking (7 to 10Kms). You can start with 15 minutes and each day increase the duration by 5 minutes or so. You can also go for swiming once or twice in a week to improve stamina and breathing capacity. If you have average active lifestyle (i.e. you walk or so some non-sitting activity at least for 1 hour in a day) None of this is mandatory. However, it will help you a lot during your trek if you do this preparation. Another important consideration is reduced air pressure and hence  reduced oxygen availability at the height of 3500 m above MSL. Usual oxygen percentage in the air at MSL is 20.9, and effective oxygen percentage at 3500 m is  13.5, which is reduction of 35% !! Although for average youngster, this  will not be a significant issue (unless one is couch potato !) as body  will naturally adjust as the trek progresses. Some people might feel  weird feeling as you start final climb before reaching Har Ki Dun.  Hence, stamina building is very important if you really want to enjoy  the trek.More information here:Trek in the Himalayas - Har Ki Dun Trek - Summary - Curious Eagle"

637,"My opinion:Let the anthem be played in movie halls on special days, like the Republic Day or Independence day. Playing it every single day before every show in every theatre in the country is, over doing it, in my opinion.Of course, I will stand up whenever and wherever the anthem is played if this decision is enforced.But I am afraid, when it is forced down on millions of people, like this, it detracts from the speciality of the anthem. A movie hall experience is not a formal Government inauguration ceremony, or convocation or similar formal functions. Let the national anthem be special and be put on a pedestal and not made to rub shoulders with advertising jingles we hear over Radio and TV.I hope they don’t start this before every single ODI or Test match, or before every single top rated TV Serial or every time Arnab Goswami opens his Talk show program which may perhaps be named “The Nation wants to know”I am also apprehensive of some zealous state patriots demanding that the State’s Anthem should also be played along with the National anthem. Whatever the logic in favour of playing the national anthem in every theatre in every show, will perhaps be valid for the State Anthem too.I would be curious to know if any country in the world has adopted this practice, or will we be unique in this respect.GV(Patriotic Indian)"

First Gentleman, although that’s a bit long. Bill is a funny one. :-)Bill Clinton once suggested “First Laddie” as he told jokingly. Too Scottish, though…Still, there are a few female Governors in the USA and a few female Presidents in the World. Their husbands are generally known as “First Gentleman” but the media generally avoids using that name.But technically, “First Gentleman” is as unofficial as “First Lady” as it is just a term used by the media and not an official title.

641,"Vampires are supposed to be scary. They are meant to be undead creatures of the night with big fangs that drink blood by biting the neck and have the ability to morph into bats.I don't mind them being able to handle sunlight as long as the reason why makes sense. In the novels “Abraham Lincoln Vampire Hunter” and “The Last American Vampire” it is explained that after the first 100 years of being a vampire, their skin adapts and they can handle sunlight.That makes a hell of a lot more sense to me than Twilight's explanation that sunlight makes them sparkle. Seriously that's just dumb. Also Vampires saying that their vegetarian because they only drink animal blood is just dumb as well. Also based on my one viewing of the first movie and reviews I've watched of the others, I'm pretty sure that they never once are shown turning into bats. Vampires are meant to be scary, not romantic.Oh and Kristen Stewart plays Bella but she can't act to save her life. She always has the same expression on her face. This is a terrible love story and it's the one most people blame for starting the trope of love triangles in books and movies. Joker and Harley's abusive one-sided romance makes more sense than this.Also the last movie has a big battle which turns out to just be a vision that one of the psysic good guys shows villain would happen if they fought. Yeah that battle, it never happened. That's a terrible way to end the series.You'll notice that I haven't mentioned the werewolves yet. Why's that? Because they're fine for the most part. They turn into wolves and they actually look right. I'd still prefer if they were scary or if the transformation was shown to be very painful and terrifying like in most movies, but I'm ok without that. However don't think that means I'm giving Jacob a pass.So Bella chose to marry and have a kid with vampire Edward over him. That's fine. But you know what isn't fine, when Jacob becomes a pedophile by imprinting on Bella's daugther, Nessie (“You nicknamed my daughter after the loch Ness monster?!!” I will never be able to take that stupid line seriously.) Jacob imprinted on a newborn baby happened to be the daughter of his ex and decided to protect and be with her. He will fall in love with her when she gets old enough. I don't care that Nessie is a vampire human hybrid that ages faster, it's still messed up pedophilia.This movie and book series is terrible, it's the worst movie and book series to ever exist. When I first heard anything about it, I was told that it's about Vampires vs Werewolves. Thats not even remotely true. Its a terrible love story and the wereworlve don't show up until the second movie. Girls liking it because they have a crush on Jacob or Edward, that's an okay excuse. But straight guys like myself, have no reason to enjoy this piece of shit. If there was a barrel full of bad movies, this would be at the bottom because it's the absolute worst. If I could do this, I'd gather every copy of the Twilight movies and books, and I'd burn them all. If I had to choose between being brutally murdered and watching or reading the whole Twilight Saga, I'd pick brutally murdered. That's how much I hate Twilight.Edit: Thanks for the upvotes. This is by far my most upvoted answer."
642,"The goal of imperialist states in the colonies was to amass wealth for the development of the crown and use colonies to spread influence abroad. It can be inferred that imperialism from its very definition was not to seek the interests of the colonies or the colonized and therefore worked against the interests of the colonized. Most of them worked like banana republics.However, there were some gains but whatever gains garnered were realized while undertaking projects that increased the exploitation of the colonies. Railway lines constructed from mines to the harbors for example improved the infrastructure of the colonies.Sub-saharan Africans lacked the education and knowledge to carry out many of such projects."
643,"Everyone writes about C++ and Java or even C. The question was what is the best language to start learning NOW in 2014 not 1994.C++ is widely used because it's absolutely general purpose. But writing in it takes time... But seriously, a lot of it. Same for CJava right now is used mostly for android and enterprise software. However the latter slowly moves to other languages. Why? Because Java is horribly redundant and boilerplated. If not android it'd be dying language.Python is good, but it's not so new or innovative. Whilst if You want to learn something from scratch You'd want something that yields great productivity and top technologies.But now what is really good language to start learning.The most useful right now is - unfortunately - JavaScript. Why? Because You can write anything in it. From websites through desktop apps (node-webkit, TideSDK), mobile apps (Cordova PhoneGap) ending on web servers and even realtime app servers (Node.js)It's extremely useful if You want to write little apps that don't require type checking and more advanced structuring.What's next? Ruby. Why? Because it's most popular language on github and stack overflow right now. Community is the most important part of any environment. What's more Ruby has been created with easiness of development and fast iteration in mind. Thanks to that You can ship Your product the fastest.But what if You want to write huge servers that are typesafe and have no performance overhead? Scala. Why? Ask LinkedIn for example. They moved their whole infrastructure into Scala and they say it has been the best move they could make.Although Scala has very steep learning curve it's worth the commitment. Martin Odersky the creator of Scala has been working on Generics system in early Java dev and he claims it's so broken he had to write language from scratch. What's more Scala uses Functional paradigm which is becoming widely popular because Amdahl's law started to matter much more than Moore's law in today's CPU architecture.PS. Even Quora uses ScalaIf You want to learn language that is popular now. OK pick C++ or Java. But if You want to learn something that will give You advantage over people with 20 year inertia. Pick one of the above/Edit other language that is worth taking look at is Go but I don't know much about it so I won't take a voice./Edit2 For iOS dev Swift is the one too/Edit3 For scalable distributed systems with nine nines of availability there's also Elixir. It's pretty new (3 years now) but it's really worth looking at. It's a maturity of Erlang with productivity of Ruby. Cool stuff/Edit4 Rust language seems to grow as a potential C++ competitor. And everything suggests it's a good trait to follow too/Edit 1.09.2015To all of You who's been upvoting my answer for last several months. I'm elated with all Your kind words.

644,"Practice. Practice Practice. Never pass up a chance to practice. So, what if you mix things up? Today is just practice. Tomorrow is another day.I am an American who has worked in two dozen countries and spent 10 years in China as well as many years in Germany and several years in Thailand. So, I have much practice with non-native speakers, such as you.1st, you are probably not too bad at English.2nd, You probably put too much pressure on yourself. 3rd, Don’t worry about your mistakes. They are building blocks.4th, Choose an American or Brit or Aussie or Kiwi who you admire, and say to yourself, “Someday, I want to talk one-on-one with that person in good English.”Maybe, that person is Barack Obama. Or maybe, it is Queen Elizabeth. It doesn’t matter. Your choice. In the meantime, everyone else you speak to in English is practice until you meet that special person. From now on, every English speaker you meet is just practice, until you sit down and talk to that one important person. Before that, it is just practice. It doesn’t matter that you fail, each and every day. It’s just practice. So, enjoy your practice and your failure. It’s practice.5th. Again. You are putting too much pressure on your self. Relax. You are probably comparing yourself to native English speakers. Yes, it will be a while before you reach that level. Don’t worry. You are only practicing.Do you think, Babe Ruth, the American baseball hero of the 1920’s and 1930’s, hit a home run, every time he came to the bat in baseball? No. He practiced.Do you think Michael Jordan, the Chicago Bulls basketball hero, scored a three pointer, every time he shot a basketball? The answer is, “No.”The secret :Every time you try to speak English, you are practicing. You practice. You make a mistake. So what??? You go home and learn from what didn’t go as well as you hoped. Then figure out how to make it better.I am lucky to live in Hawaii. Years ago, I wanted to learn Japanese. Everyday, I would go to Waikiki Beach and ask a Japanese tourist questions such as, “What did you do yesterday? Tell me about your job? What do you plan to do in Hawaii?” I would go home and learn learn from my mistakes. The next day, I would go back to the beach and have a new teacher. Step by step, my Japanese becomes better. You should do the same thing.You will not hit a Home Run the first time at bat. But, after 20 times, you will start to hit home runs with some consistency. (Watch the movie Groundhog Day starring Bill Murray). Practice makes you better.My wife was probably much like you. She is a Hakka, a minority person from China. She grew up in a small, minority mountain village in China. She set a goal of learning English, (probably because, as a minority, she would not meet her goals in China). From then on, she never passed up an opportunity to try and learn English. That was how we met. I am very, very proud of my wife. My wife got up early each morning to watch the English television news from Hong Kong. She worked as a waitress in an International bar in China to improve her English. She didn’t miss a chance to assist a westerner shopping in a local market. On Sundays, she awoke early to take a two hour bus ride into the city to go to an English Corner session where she could talk with westerners.Now, she is in Hawaii. She graduated at the top of her University of Hawaii undergraduate and graduate classes. Now, as a manager, she continues to work diligently and is on her way to becoming an executive in a 5 star hotel in Hawaii.Her comment, “It is easy to succeed in America. All you have to do is work harder than everyone else.” But you do have to work hard, and use every opportunity to practice your skills.I encourage you to keep trying and don’t worry about your mistakes. It is all about practice. Remember, what you are doing now is practice for the future. Don’t worry, if you make a few mistakes today.

646,"16 hours. Hmm, you are definitely a focused person. You are doing something that 99% of us are struggling to do.But ask yourself,How much quality time am i spending out of those 16 hours in studying?See, NO. OF HOURS DOESN'T MATTER.Quality > quantityOne could study more in 7-8 hours than what you study in 15–16 hours.Why do you see the no. Of hours? If you are seeing the hours, then you will not be able to focus for studies. You just study. But, This will not give you results.A correct approach is required.Let's play a little game.Answer these easy questions if you can.—What is your name?How old are you?2+2=?Do you have any siblings?In which class do you study?What are the subjects that you study?Which subject do you like the most?You were able to answer all of the above questions. Weren't you? Now ask,WHY?WHY WERE YOU ABLE TO ANSWER ALL THE QUESTIONS SO ACCURATELY?There is a logic behind this. The thing is, when i asked you those questions,You understood all the questions perfectly. That is why you didn't say your age when i asked your name. You answered only what was asked. No more, no less.It means that,YOUR CONCEPT IS 100% CLEAR. You have a brain like everyone else. You are not inferior.YOU ARE BRILLIANT!!!Now, How is it related to studies and toppers?If i ask you what is quantum chromodynamics(QCD)? you might be sitting with mouth open, blank. This is because your CONCEPT is not clear regarding qcd. That is why you didn't answer it. And If the same question would come in your exam, then you would have scored 0 and someone might have scored full. This is whom you would call TOPPER!But this doesn't mean that you are a weak student, you just need to give time and you will also become a topper.The secret to top is crystal like clear concepts. The secret is to make these questions answerable as easy as day to day questions that you come across. Though you might have heard this but this is underrated. A lot.That is why toppers spend a majority of time in understanding theory and spend lesser amount of time in numericals, which are nothing but questioning your theoretical understanding in number form.Pay attention to clear your concepts. If you did not understand from the book, ask your teacher or go to YouTube but never underestimate conceptual clarity.Developing a habit is very important. Make a habit, stick to it. You should have a fixed sleeping and waking up time. Your mind will become comfortable or else you would trouble yourself daily.Study as if you are to teach someone. In my case, whenever i lack clarity in any topic, i find a classmate who also haven't understood the topic and i tell him that I'll explain you the next day(*if he wants to). Then i study with a mindset that i have to explain it to somebody so i must be knowing everything to tackle his doubts. I watch YouTube lectures and study from the books and…i'm done. It's one of the most effective method. It's a business where there are only profits to both sides and absolutely no losses.You need not study the whole day! This is a common misconception among us that toppers study the entire day(*few exceptions present). Instead, they study smartly and do other activities as well. The best example is Roman Saini sir whom i am greatly inspired from. He says that he studied for about 7-8 hours a day, and also learnt playing guitar alongside(watch his ted talk). He is not nobody, he has achieved something that a lot of people in India wants to become desperately. He got selected in AIIMS Delhi and also, he cleared UPSC to become an IAS Officer. He has co founded a great platform for upsc and other competitive exam aspirants with Gaurav Munjal sir, UNACADEMY. I also aspire to become a civil servant and believe me, they are the best!Roman sir says that you should sleep for 8 hours, study for 8 hours and do whatever you want for the next 8 hours. There is no exam that cannot be cleared by studying 6-8 hours daily.SayonaraHave a better you ahead!!-Ritik"
647,"Four ways, basically:1. Ad revenue. When there's an ad on a video watch page, the creator of that video shares the revenue from that ad with YouTube. YouTubers aren't allowed to discuss ad rates, but it's generally acknowledged to be between $1 per 1,000 views, up to a few dollars per 1,000 views. Many YouTubers also make sponsored or branded content, in which they share or discuss a product for a fee. This can be very lucrative, but there's also the risk of clouding your authentic relationship with your audience.2. Merchandising. Many YouTube creators sell shirts or mugs featuring logos or inside jokes. There are companies designed for niche creators looking to make merch for their audiences (I co-own one, Don't Forget To Be Awesome). For some YouTubers, this can be a bigger source of income than ads (it is for my brother and me), but for most it's a relatively small business.3. Ancillary products. Many YouTubers are able to use their existing audiences as activation energy for other projects--from tours to music to makeup lines to books. Because many of these projects have better established business models (like, people generally expect to pay for books), this can also be a great business. It's unlikely my novel The Fault in Our Stars would've been so successful without the activation energy provided by the viewers of our videos.4. Subscription fees. This is an emerging business model, but I think a very promising one. Voluntary subscription platforms like Patreon: Support the creators you love allow viewers to support the creators they love directly. This decreases the influence of advertisers and makes creators directly answerable to their audiences. It does, however, require that a percentage of viewers choose to pay. I suspect most YouTubers make most of their money from ads, but I think advertising is probably shrinking percentage-wise as a revenue source, which I think is mostly good news. I think advertising is an important part of funding our online experiences, but ultimately I'd argue the Internet is healthiest when serving the needs of its human users rather than the needs of its corporate sponsors."
648,"Okay, so you are single, and you are happy about it. I know. I get it. But let's cut the bullshit. We all feel lonely at times. We all wish for that hand in hand and that I love you whispered into our ear. So, single, happy, yes, but sometimes, it sucks. Accept it. So now, let's talk about how to go about finding love in this loveless, soulless, and fake world. But you have already given up on love, right? Perfect, happens, happens with me too. But still, let's try and answer that: ""how?""The first step to find love is to stop looking for love. Yes, bingo, super idiotic, you might be thinking. But no, look, we end up eating the crappiest food when we are super hungry. We adjust, we compromise, and we lower our standards when we want something too badly. So, if you are desperately looking out for love, chances are you will end up dating your worst mistake. So, chill, relax, and calm down.Remember, when you are single af, even the people, whom you won't even look at twice, will look like: ""omg, that's the one I have been waiting for"". It happens. Crushes happen. Don't let your desperate hormones fool your heart into hey, it's love, when it's just a stupid little crush/liking. You haven't stayed single for this long to just let a spark burn your whole heart, black. You need to let it bloom. You need to let it be love, first, not just a crush.Don't give a shit about ""looks matter vs looks don't matter"" debate. It's your life. So, whatever sails your boat, accept it. I don't judge people who say: looks matter to me. Because hey, it's about their life, their liking, and their love. Who are we to say no, love like this, you idiot? But, one thing, yes, and that goes for me too. Look, looks matter to me. But, and a big ass but: I should find her beautiful. I don't care if she is your ""ugliest"" girl. If I find her beautiful, then that's done, game over. Now what made me find a so-called ""ugly"" girl beautiful? Well, none of your freaking business. I find her gorgeous for whatever reasons: inner beauty, her character, her heart, her voice, her eyes, her hands, her hair, her lips, her curves, her skinny bones, her brains, her dreams, her scars, her pimples, her whatever, my wish.Don't set a timeline. Don't follow a ""structure"" advised by ""relationship gurus"". Love is crazy. Let it happen. Don't strangulate the love bird, by chaining it in clock chains. Let love fly. Let the heart fly. Let things go stupid. Let things go super fast or let things go super slow. Don't love, in fear. Don't hug, half there. Don't kiss, half guilty. Do everything that feels right.And most importantly, make love a part of your life. Just a part, important, yes, most important even, still fine, but just a part, never the whole life. Keep your passion. Keep your dreams. Keep your friends. I repeat, keep your friends. Let your best friend stay the same important person. Let your family stay at the top. Let there be no phase when you don't care about your family and friends, because hey, my love life was messed up. And finally, love without fear, without regrets. And don't worry. Love happens, again, even the true love, again, yes, all bullshit lines. You just need to find the right person, once again. "

650,"First of all, what are man boobs?Man boobs are essentially flabby pectorals. If they get bad enough it is tagged as a medical condition called Gynecomastia (often mistakenly spelled gynaecomastia or gynaecomastia). Gynecomastia is a condition that many men suffer from and it is very embarrassing because it makes your chest look more feminine than masculine. The extra fat around the chest area can look saggy and is very unattractive. Men that suffer from man boobs often feel like they are alone in that condition, but it is literally very common.Many men wish they could find a way to get rid of their man boobs, and many of them try. However, most of the men that try to get rid of their man boobs fail because, frankly, they are very difficult to get rid of unless you know the right methods and techniques.How to get rid of them?To put it very simply, the safest way to get rid of man boobs is diet and exercise. But this is a massive oversimplification. You can go on a diet, follow it religiously, lose weight, and still have man boobs. Man boobs will not disappear just because you stopped drinking soda, or have replaced fast food with salad. There are many kinds of fat, some even found in so-called healthy food, that target the chest area. You can be on a diet that works in general but is actually adding to your man boob problem.It is important to find a specific diet that targets man boobs because you have to avoid the foods that cause fat production in your chest, even if they are considered healthy overall.Why can't I just exercise a lot?Exercise helps burn fat, but different exercises target different areas. Running and walking can help you get in shape and increase your endurance and conditioning, but they will not do much to get rid of man boobs. This is very frustrating because you can run every day, drop many pounds, and still have those annoying and embarrassing man boobs.You will be able to bench press more weight and do more push ups but will not see a difference in your man boobs for a long time. There are some exercises that usually targets the pectorals and burns the fat even better and these include using a butterfly machine, or doing iron presses.What do I recommend?Man boobs are very stubborn so getting rid of them can seem impossible if you are not eating the right things, and doing the right exercises.You cannot go on a general diet, do general exercise, and hope to get rid of stubborn man boobs. You need to do specific exercises that work quickly and avoid the foods that compound the problem. It takes a combination of elements and tactics to get rid of man boobs quickly. When the right methods and processes are used together, getting rid of man boobs is possible.What specifically worked for me was following the Chest Coach System by Cliff Manchester and supplementing his program with the Gynexin Alpha Formula."

652,"Scientific Reason :There are thousands of temples all over India in different size, shape and locations but not all of them are considered to be built the Vedic way. Generally, a temple should be located at a place where earth's magnetic wave path passes through densely. It can be in the outskirts of a town/village or city, or in middle of the dwelling place, or on a hilltop. The essence of visiting a temple is discussed here.Now, these temples are located strategically at a place where the positive energy is abundantly available from the magnetic and electric wave distributions of north/south pole thrust. The main idol is placed in the core center of the temple, known as ""*Garbhagriha*"" or *Moolasthanam*. In fact, the temple structure is built after the idol has been placed. This *Moolasthanam* is where earth’s magnetic waves are found to be maximum. We know that there are some copper plates, inscribed with Vedic scripts, buried beneath the Main Idol. What are they really? No, they are not God’s / priests’ flash cards when they forget the *shlokas*. The copper plate absorbs earth’s magnetic waves and radiates it to the surroundings. Thus a person regularly visiting a temple and walking clockwise around the Main Idol receives the beamed magnetic waves and his body absorbs it. This is a very slow process and a regular visit will let him absorb more of this positive energy. Scientifically, it is the positive energy that we all require to have a healthy life.Further, the Sanctum is closed on three sides. This increases the effect of all energies. The lamp that is lit radiates heat energy and also provides light inside the sanctum to the priests or *poojaris* performing the pooja. The ringing of the bells and the chanting of prayers takes a worshipper into trance, thus not letting his mind waver. When done in groups, this helps people forget personal problems for a while and relieve their stress. The fragrance from the flowers, the burning of camphor give out the chemical energy further aiding in a different good aura. The effect of all these energies is supplemented by the positive energy from the idol, the copper plates and utensils in the *Moolasthan*am / *Garbagraham*. *Theertham*, the “holy” water used during the pooja to wash the idol is notplain water cleaning the dust off an idol. It is a concoction of Cardamom,*Karpura* (Benzoin), zaffron / saffron, *Tulsi* (Holy Basil), Clove, etc...Washing the idol is to charge the water with the magnetic radiations thus increasing its medicinal values. Three spoons of this holy water is distributed to devotees. Again, this water is mainly a source of magneto-therapy. Besides, the clove essence protects one from tooth decay, the saffron & *Tulsi* leafs protects one from common cold and cough, cardamom and *Pachha Karpuram* (benzoin), act as mouth fresheners. It is proved that *Theertham* is a very good blood purifier, as it is highly energized. Hence it is given as *prasadam* to the devotees. This way, one can claim to remain healthy by regularly visiting the Temples. This is why our elders used to suggest us to offer prayers at the temple so that you will be cured of many ailments. They were not always superstitious. Yes, in a few cases they did go overboard when due to ignorance they hoped many serious diseases could be cured at temples by deities. When people go to a temple for the *Deepaaraadhana*, and when the doors open up, the positive energy gushes out onto the persons who are there. The water that is sprinkled onto the assemblages passes on the energy to all. This also explains why men are not allowed to wear shirts at a few temples and women are requested to wear more ornaments during temple visits. It is through these jewels (metal) that positive energy is absorbed by the women. Also, it is a practice to leave newly purchased jewels at an idol’s feet and then wear them with the idol’s blessings. This act is now justified after reading this article. This act of “seeking divine blessings” before using any new article, like books or pens or automobiles may have stemmed from this through mere observation.Energy lost in a day’s work is regained through a temple visit and one is refreshed slightly. The positive energy that is spread out in the entire temple and especially around where the main idol is placed, are simply absorbed by one's body and mind. Did you know, every Vaishnava(Vishnu devotees), “must” visit a Vishnu temple twice every day in their location. Our practices are NOT some hard and fast rules framed by 1 man and his followers or God’s words in somebody’s dreams. All the rituals, all the practices are, in reality, well researched, studied and scientifically backed thesis which form the ways of nature to lead a good healthy life.The scientific and research part of the practices are well camouflaged as “elder’s instructions” or “granny’s teaching’s” which should be obeyed as a mark of respect so as to once again, avoid stress to the mediocre brains."
653,"Male circumcision - the Islamic ViewMale infants, worldwide, are circumcised for various social, religious and/or medical reasons.Generally, the ritual of circumcision is traced back to the time of the greatest of prophets Ibraheem (peace be upon him) when Allah commanded him to circumcise himself, his son Ishmael and all his male family members, and he followed Allah's order.Today Muslims are the largest religious nation to circumcise their male offspring. This ritual shows their belonging and closeness to their spiritual ancestor and the physical forefather, Prophet Ibraheem (peace be upon him).Because circumcision was also practised by all prophets, traditionally it has been in practice throughout the history among the followers of Prophet Ibraheem and establishes an Islamic connection to the ritual.Allah ordered the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) to follow the religion of Ibraheem (peace be upon him). Allah says in the Holy Qur'an:""Then We inspired you: 'Follow the religion of Ibraheem, the upright in Faith'."" [The Holy Qur'an 16:123]And an important part of the religion of Ibrahim is circumcision.The Prophet Ibraheem showed by his actions that he completely sumbitted himself to God's will, and encouraged his family and household members to obey Allah's commands without fail.The Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) said: ""The Prophet Ibrahim circumcised himself when he was eighty years old."" [Related by Al-Bukhari, Muslim & Ahmad]But unlike the Jewish tradition, in Islam circumcision is not a symbol of Allah's covenant with humans.​​​​​The Holy Qur'an does not impose an obligation on parents to circumcise their children, but the prophet Mohammed is reported to have stated that ""Circumcision is a sunnah(customary or traditional) for the men. Most references to male circumcision occur in the examples and traditions of the Prophet (peace be upon him). Therefore the scholars strongly recommend circumcision for male.From this point of view, traditionally, adult male converts to Islam are encouraged to undergo the operation.Furthermore, besides submission to the Will of God, male circumcision is an important ritual aimed at improving cleanliness. Therefore, in Arabic, circumcision is also known as tahara, meaning purification or cleanliness.Islam strongly emphasises cleanliness and purification both spiritual and physical. The mental and spiritual purification cleanses the heart while the social and physical purification cleanses the body as in circumcision. It also indicate that circumcised males are regarded as more pure (clean).Although circumcision is not one of the Five Pillars of the Faith, which consist of: the profession of faith, daily prayer, fasting at Ramadan, giving money to the poor (charity), and the pilgrimage to Mecca. However, this ritual is an act of purification and connects the person to the Prophet Ibraheem (peace be upon him) and his religion, Islam.The Qur'an says: ""Allah does not want to place burden on you. Rather, He wants to purify you and to complete His favours to you so that you may be grateful."" [The Holy Qur'an 5:7]The Hadith, the acts and the approvals of the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) together constitute the Sunnah. This is the second source of Islamic Law.God says in the Holy Qur'an: ""Verily in the Messenger of Allah you have a good example for anyone whose hope is in Allah and the Last Day, and who engages much in the praise of Allah.""[The Holy Qur'an 33:21]A Hadith related by Bukhari reads: ""The practices related to Fitrah (the nature) are five: circumcision, shaving the pubic hair, trimming the moustache, cutting the nails and removing the hair of the armpits.""Circumcision, throughout history, has been thought to provide a measure of protection against infections of the foreskin.In fact these are general practices that humans have..."

656,"There once lived a boy who had a bad temper. He would get angry at every little thing. One day, his father gave him a bag of nails and told him, ""Every time you get angry, hammer a nail into that front wall.""And so the activity started. On the first day, the boy hammered 50 nails. The next day, he hammered 40. Each time he used to go there, he repented being angry - it was quite a challenge to hammer a nail into that damn brick wall! Slowly, he discovered that controlling anger was easier than hammering, and the number of nails hammered started going down.Eventually, a day came when he didn't get angry, and he felt the joy of it. Now his father gave him another task, ""If you do not get angry the entire day, remove one nail from the wall."" After several days, all the nails were removed.Now his father took him near the wall and asked him what did he see. The boy replied that he can see holes in the wall. The father then explained to his son: ""These holes are like the scars that you leave on people when you get angry. No matter how many times you say sorry, the scar does not go.""So I suggest you two things:Realize that words once spoken cannot come back. Your anger hurts others and leaves a sour impression that lasts forever.Each time you get angry, ""hammer a nail"". Simplest thing you can do is to carry a pocket diary and put a line each time you get angry. Then at night, count the number of lines for that day. If you make this a habit, each time you would get angry, you would be reminded to note it down. Indirectly, you would also realize that you getting angry. And because you are conscious and aware at that time, you would find it easier to control your actions and subdue anger.I hope the day comes soon when you don't have any line in your diary."
657,"In my experience working in autism elementary school classes, I see several differences between boys and girl. I was at an autism unit yesterday where there were six students - 5 boys and 1 girl. That’s the “NORM” set-up as far as the number of boys and girls. I would be shocked to go into an autism unit that had more girls than boys. The teacher, the other aide, and myself spent far more time keeping an eye on each of the five boys than the girl. She was the only one who was verbal. I could easily see her moving into the general ed population but the others maybe but they have a longer road to get there. 1Girls with autism seem to behave in ways that are considered acceptable as opposed to boys. For example, girls appear to be passive, withdrawn, dependent on others, uninvolved, or even depressed (just as boys do). They may become passionately and even obsessively interested in very specific areas (just as boys do), but they may not gravitate toward the areas of technology or math.Girls with autism are less likely to behave aggressively and more likely to be passive or withdrawn. I know that personally since I will steer away from confrontation. It takes a lot before I’m backed into a corner and my aggressiveness sets in.Girls are more likely to choose interests (such as TV stars or music) that appear more typical than, for example, many boys' perseverative interests in schedules, statistics, or transportation. Again, I know that all too well. I was obsessed back in the day with soap opera characters and music stars.While boys' social communication issues become challenging very early in their lives, girls may be able to manage the social demands of early childhood but run into difficulties as they enter early adolescence. This was the way it was with me. I recall being socialable in 1st grade but by middle school I was more or less socially mute.Research suggests that autism may look quite different in girls—so different, in fact, that it can be difficult to diagnose. I couldn’t agree more as someone with autism and someone who works with fellow travelers on the spectrum."

659,"As a USDA inspected sausage manufacturer, the general rule that we suggest to our customers for our standard pork sausages (like a simple pork Italian sausage) is about 5-7 days for BOTH raw and cooked sausages. Please note: This is 5-7 days from the date of manufacture for pork sausages, or 5-7 days from the date of thawing the product if the pork sausage was frozen immediately after production. The USDA's ""Keep Food Safe! Food Safety Basics"" cold-storage suggestions suggests a more conservative estimate of 1-2 days for raw beef, chicken, pork, and turkey sausages, and this may be a better estimate when storing proteins other than pork, and also if you are unsure of when the product was manufactured, if you are unsure about whether or not the product was manufactured by a USDA inspected facility, and/or if your sausages have not been religiously stored according the the guideline I list below.It is possible they will last longer than this time-frame; however, there are so many things that can go into this equation that you are best staying on the safe side. Here are some things that can affect the shelf life:5-7 days from the date of manufacture is a conservative estimate, assuming that the product remains refrigerated below 40 Deg F. at all times. Shelf life is reduced every time a product’s temperature rises above that threshold, even just a few degrees.Preservatives and cures do matter. All sausages contain preservatives (even salt is a preservative), but pre-cooked sausages often contain cures (e.g., sodium nitrites) and/or anti-microbials (e.g., sodium lactate and sodium diacitate) that can significantly extend the shelf life of a product. There have even been experiments that have shown that adding anti-microbial salts like sodium lactate and sodium diacitate in a food can actually kill new bacteria that is introduced to a sausage after its production. Still, be cautious, and don’t eat anything that looks or smells bad.The ingredients and recipes matter, A LOT!! USDA requires wholesale sausage manufacturers to use sanitary ingredients in their production; however, local butchers or restaurants that make their own sausage are typically not USDA inspected facilities and are not held to these strict guidelines. That being said, while a facility like mine will produce a sausage that may last far longer than 7 days when refrigerated properly, the local butcher down the street who makes the same recipe but instead uses wet marinates or fresh fruits or vegetables in his/her recipe may last even less than 1-2 days because the bacteria from the marinate or the fresh fruits and vegetables will cause more rapid spoilage, and because simple sausage-making equipment can add excess heat from friction during the production process. Ask your local butcher about his/her use of fresh fruits and vegetables before you buy.Be conservative. Sausages freeze very well, so I would recommend keeping them frozen to be on the safe side. Also, purchasing sausages that are manufactured by from a USDA inspected sausage manufacturer (like my company) will typically be a safer bet. See How to Find the USDA Establishment (EST) Number on Food Packaging to learn how to identify the USDA mark of inspection on your preferred products."

You have people defending triple talaq and beef ban, but nobody comes out in the support for our basic human rights (Not any privilege).Gay word is used in bullying here, like its an abuse (You must have heard the phrase “Tu gay hai kya”). I have to constantly hide my sexuality and pretend that I'm straight, Which is big deal. It’s suffocationg when you really like someone and want to tell your friend or that person, but you have to strangle your feelings (something which gay people become pro in!) because It’s abnormal.I hail from a small town of UP. I've known my sexuality when I was in 12th. I never discussed it with anyone. Though having sex with boys or fucking boys is an act in which many guys are involved in India (especially rural India), but loving them is a different case here.And that's what I happen to do.Now, there are three things which really matters when you're different:1. Your loved ones. In India - most of the people have never seen homosexuals (including my parents) so there’s ignorance about homosexuality. That’s why telling them that you're homosexual is beyond the realm of imagination.2. Law. Which criminalize the homosexuals in India.3. Society, of India? enough said. Majority of people with topi and tilak would rather fight for their imaginary gods than for the rights of fellow human beings.Are you feeling something? Imagine what would you do had you been in the similar stifling life. I’ve wasted so much of my precious time worrying about this and my future, which resulted in poor academic performance and I ended up being somewhere I never wanted to be.However, It doesn’t make any sense for India to be this way. Why?Because I've been taught since my childhood that India is the largest democracy in world. Are these just words that we use to tap our back or do they really mean something to us? DEMOCRACY people!Because I've been taught that democracy is the rule of people, by the people for the people, while in reality, It’s the rule of majority, by the majority, for the majority. Not the minuscule minority. sigh!Because Indians need to justify each and everything by their ancient damn mythology and religions. Like this god also did that, this is mentioned in out book and so on! Why do I have to give a damn about that?Because politician here believe that rape is just a minor mistake by boys but homosexuality is against our culture(A hypothetical term used by hypocrites who have nothing else to defend).Because my loving Prime Minister choose to stay quiet about our rights while he can speak continuously on Hygiene in India, he can request a gay CEO (Tim cook) to invest in India and he can brag about human rights in the address to USA Congress.Because people here so petrified by family and society that its impossible for us to have someone like Harvey Milk or Ellen or Tim cook. I’ve even talked to gay people who say that they’re privileged as hell in this country and they don’t want to indulge into this agenda that we’re pursuing. Those hypocrites are happy in their cocoon and that’s why we’re seen as a minuscule minority.Currently, I'm in an engineering college, writing this answer, pretty fucked up with all the gay underground dating stuff, dreaming to move out of a country which denies to accept me."
662,"Former QA Manager from Amazon here. First, congratulations on your offer. Amazon is an awesome place to work.  Amazon has a pretty thorough interview process. Based on the discussion after interview, the hiring team decided to offer you the job. If they offered you a QA job though you applied for the SDET role, it means two things. First, the loop agrees that you are a good fit as a QAE. Second, the loop could not reach consensus on your fit for the SDET role. Note: This could just be lack of consensus or a consensus that you are not fit.> What quality assurance engineer do in amazon?I read some of the answers below about the QAE role. Most of them are wrong. In Amazon, QAEs spend quite a bit of their time coding. The engineers review code, write automation scripts and extend automation to cover new scenarios.> Can I switch roles?Yes, you can, but once you check out the QAE role, you may not want to. SDETs focus on building frameworks and focus on different problem sets. QAE offers a much more ""closer"" to the customer perspective. You get a lot of exposure to business activities. As a manager (of managers), I have seen QAEs switch over to SDETs, in one case to an SDE. My advice is to go in with the mindset of learning as much as you can and delivering as best as you can. Rather than focus on the title, focus on the kind of work you need to do. Folks who have walked in with ""I will come in and switch"" have almost always failed at their current role.> Will there be enough opportunities for a QA guy at amazon to grow/move to work as SDE/T?For sure, Though, Amazon off-late has been focusing on working on growing QAEs as QAEs (They don't have a lot of QAE IIIs or Principal QAEs). Amazon's org structure is quite flat, and managers do have quite a large playing room. If you do well, I don't see any reason why your manager will not leverage your skills. For example, last year, we had pretty big resource crunch in the development team. As a QA manager, I was able to offer up one of my QAEs to join the development team, albeit temporarily, to help. Even though, the QAE did a fantastic job in the development team, his passion was to go down the SDET path. He is now an SDET in the same team. > Will a QA guy at Amazon be considered if he applies for the role SDE/T through internal postings? Will the application be considered?Yes, I know of many cases where engineers have applied for a job posting different from their current titles. Please expect the interview process to be ""identical"" to that of an external hire. Internal interviews are generally lighter, but in such cross title cases, they may be just as rigorous. > Should I wait for six months and try again for SDE/T, with more preparations?Tough one, It really depends on what you want to do. More often than not, I think people are put off by the QAE title. The job, role and the nature of work you will do is fabulous. If (a) you like the work you will be doing, and (b) are comfortable with the compensation, I say go for it. PM me if you want to talk about this. For (a) you can ask the recruiter to put you in touch with the HM and they will gladly talk to you about what challenges they deal with on a daily basis.~Vivek"
663,"My interest in answering this arose from seeing the very interesting term ‘Triple Squeeze’. This answer is an attempt to trace the Indian-Indonesian and the Pakistani-Indonesian relations. Let me answer it in a timeline oriented way.A good time to start would be the Indonesian National Revolution. Just like the British were our colonizers, Indonesia was colonized by the Dutch. The Indonesian National Revolution was an armed conflict and diplomatic struggle between Indonesia and the Dutch empire, and an internal social revolution. It took place between Indonesia's declaration of independence in 1945 and the Dutch recognition of Indonesia's independence at the end of 1949. Before all this happened, the Japanese invaded Indonesia in 1942 and the Dutch colonial rule was ended. By 1945, when the World War II came to an end, the Japanese had to surrender, but the Dutch were severely weakened in the WWII and were in no position to come back as a serious military force until early 1946.This paved the way for the two most important nationalist leaders Sukarno and Mohammad Hatta to form the Republic of Indonesia. Since the Dutch were still not strong enough to return, the Allies decided to place the archipelago under the jurisdiction of British Admiral Earl Louis Mountbatten, the Supreme Allied Commander, South East Asia Command (the Americans were concentrating on the Japanese home islands) and the British troops started arriving from the end of 1945. The Dutch started arriving from early 1946 onwards. This led to a bloody struggle between the Republic of Indonesia and the Dutch - British forces. After 4 years of struggle, though the Dutch won the war in military terms, Indonesia ended up gaining Independence. Sukarno was the new leader of Indonesia.One of the key reasons for the Indonesian political victory in the Indonesian National Revolution was a defection in the British Indian army. Muhammad Ali Jinnah (who was at that time President of the All-India Muslim League - India and Pakistan were still not Independent nations) encouraged Muslim soldiers serving in British Indian army to join hands with Indonesians against their fight against the Dutch Imperial colonisation of Indonesia. As a result, 600-Muslim soldiers of the British Indian Army deserted the colonial forces putting their lot at stake, allied with Indonesians. Out of these 600 soldiers, 500 of them died in war. This is considered as a precursor for Pakistani-Indonesian relations. Please note that Sukarno was the leader of Indonesia during this period.After India got her Independence, India and Indonesia formally commenced diplomatic relations in 1951. In 1955, India (Jawaharlal Nehru) and Indonesia (Sukarno) were one of the five founding members of the Non Aligned Movement. Diplomatic relations between India and Indonesia, at this point of time, were pretty strong.Proceed to 1963, and Indonesia is involved in a confrontation with Malaysia. The Indonesian–Malaysian confrontation was a violent conflict from 1963–66 that stemmed from Indonesia's opposition to the creation of Malaysia. Please note that Sukarno was still very much the leader of Indonesia during that period. Now what happened was that New Delhi supported Malaysia morally during this struggle. India and Indonesia were less supportive of each other’s broader regional ambitions. When Indonesia sought to achieve regional hegemony in Southeast Asia by scuttling the creation of an independent Malaya, India gave Malaya significant support in various international forums as well as advocating a continuing security role for Great Britain in the region.The rivalry between India and Indonesia during the early 1960s was aggravated by Indonesia’s increasing tilt toward communist China, including the perceived formation of a China-Indonesia-Pakistan axis hostile to India. Indonesian President Sukarno’s growing radicalism l..."
664,"“Perfect”? No such thing, friend. What you might call a perfect cup might be another's “Meh”, and their “Meh” might be another's piss-water.But there are some general rules for making “Better-than-usual” coffee.There are three main components to coffee:I. BeansFor the love of God, leave the Folgers and the Nescafé on the shelf. They aren't going to help you here.Ideally, you'd get some locally-freshly-roasted beans that were imported from a single origin. But, we don't all live in a hipster's paradise. Some whole-beans from a local café, or even unflavoured beans from the supermarket will do just fine.For the record, instant coffee is dried compost. Don't bother.II. GrindHere's where we start to get pretentious.You've bought your beans - great! Now you need to grind them.Different coffees require different grinds. Espresso needs a fine grind. French pressed coffee needs a coarse. For drip coffees, you need something in the middle.Grinders vary from $10 to $1000. If you don't have $80 or so dollars burning a hole in your pocket, just get them ground at the café or grocery store you bought the coffee in. This will reduce the lifespan of the coffee*, so don't buy too much at a time.If you can afford it, don't get a grinder with metal blades. You want to grind the beans, not cut them. Look for “Conical Burr” grinders.*Ground coffee has more surface area. Coffee + O2 = oxidizes coffee = stale piss-water.III. MethodLet's assume we're talking about a normal cup of brew. The various different types of preparing coffee, from espresso to Turkish and back to lattés, are beyond the scope of this answer.For regular, or “drip” coffee, you have two common options:i. MachinesWe've all used these. You stick your ground coffee in a filter, you fill it with water, you press “On”, and 5–15 minutes later - voilà! You have coffee.The problem with these is that you have no control. Now, this isn't necessarily a bad thing - less human input means better consistency. A machine will produce a good coffee everytime.Obviously, don't cheap out on your machine. Spend as much as you think your quality of coffee is worth. $100 should be plenty for the regular consumer. Keurigs and Nespresso machines are for convenience, not quality.These will only ever be “Good”, though. If you want “Great++”, you'll have to do things manually.ii. Pour-Overs.Pour-over coffee is aptly named.You take the role of the machine, and you pour the water over your coffee.For this, you'll need a controlled stream of water. Good luck pouring a consistent amount of water out of a pan for 3–4 minutes. Goose-neck kettles are specifically designed for this purpose - you'll need one.You'll also need something to hold your filter - Haario V60s are the leading brand for filters and filter holders. These won't make much a difference for your coffee, there are just various aesthetic choices.Pour-over techniques are nuanced, easy to learn, difficult to master, and explained in posts much longer than this by those much more qualified than I. A quick Google search will yield hundreds of results.I will say this: your first Pour-over coffee will not be great. It likely won't be good. Nor will your dozen'th, but it will be better.But by your hundred'th, you'll be making coffee better than any machine will.Now that I've written what I'm sure has been writ hundreds of times, in hundreds of ways, I'd like to reiterate - no coffee you or I or anyone makes will be perfect. But you can get close."
665,"Look Back A Couple of Decades and the Current Republican Power Grab Becomes ClearMore news is emerging about Russian interference in our recent elections, but it’s only a small part of a larger Republican strategy to steal elections and centralize their power in our Congress. The fact that Russia is clearly helping the Republican agenda? Well, they have targeted other countries similarly, supporting a world-wide authoritarian power grab.Russian hackers breached voting systems in 39 US statesThese problems go back decades, well before the Russian hacking problems that have been uncovered in dozens of states. I don’t know if you all remember, but the 2000 election was decided by disallowing a huge number of votes in Florida — remember that Jeb Bush was governor when George W. Bush ‘won’ the election?. This might seem like a harsh accusation, but elements within the Republican Party have been stealing elections for a long time now. It’s a strategy that has led to the current power grab and policies that are now being shoved down our throats. My prediction is that they will soon be held accountable.This whole thing is bigger than most of us can imagine.We’d be well on our way to a prosperous and sustainable future had Al Gore won in 2000. Ultimately the vote tally was only 537 votes higher for Gore. But George Bush was given the win after thousands of votes were thrown out in Florida.United States presidential election, 2000 - WikipediaVoter suppression targets low-income and minority communities especially:Voting rights are under assault nationwide.

667,"The term fermentation has been derived from latin word ‘fever’ meaning ‘to boil’ because during fermentation a lot of froth is formed due to evolution of CO2 gas and it gives the appearance of boiling.The process of fermentation was discovered by Pasteur (1860) while Leibig and Buchner related this process with enzymes. Products obtain by fermentation depend upon the nature of enzyme.Decomposition of complex organic compounds into simpler substances by enzymes present in micro- organisms is called fermentation.Examples : putrefaction of food, souring of milk or curd and formation of vinegar."
668,"Great little film. Love to see creativity like this. I have few pointers to help you out.You need to have different shots. This is a must to break up the monotony of the film. The same shot, one after the other is hard to watch without wanting to fast forward. Most shots should be short as this is a short, but this also holds true for most filmmaking. Pick your favororite show or movie, the shots rarely go over 6 seconds, in fact more often they are much shorter (2 to 4 seconds),unless establishing some sort of dramatic tension, establishing a location or setting up blocking for multiple characters or events.Lets use your film as an example. The final repair scene for the ColorShift takes roughly 40 seconds without a single camera angle change. You could break this up with a mid shot of you putting the laptop away and opening the unit, cut to, Closeup of your hands working, cut to, your face in some sort of determined look, and back to the closeup of the repair. After the repair is complete you could go back to a mid shot of you in black and white, hit the button and voila, color again with a satisfied look on you face. End it there, no need to return the package, jut walk off screen and flicker the color.Establish the location of the building with a wide angle establishing shot, (it doesn’t even have to be your actual building, no one will ever know). Show us where the action is going to take place. Establish the room you are sitting in. Staggering the type of shots from wide or mid to closeups will draw more attention when the closeups are used and will make them more powerful and much more effective.Instead of the same static shot changing color take stills or 2 second long shots of the actual world outside your door and color shift the color on those images, it adds a more personal feel and creates more value for your film. The static long shot changing for ten seconds seems mechanical and impersonal.That all having been said, I hope you understand this was meant to be constructive. I really enjoyed your film. Great work, great concept, great story. Keep making films, you really have something there. Hope this helps.Take care,Jim"

673,"I actually have a different opinion than Larry on this than Larry.  I have liquidated an accordion shop. One of my closest friends in the world was Walter Kuhr who owned the wonderful Main Squeeze Accordions on the lower east side in NYC.    When he passed away, I had to learn a lot about accordions to take care of the closing of the store, so I did.Also through Walter, I learned a LOT about buying accordions.  Let me tell you, it's easy to buy shit. There are a few questions before anyone can give you a good answer.1.) Do you know how to play piano?If so, you've got a head start and I'd say you could definitely start with a 24 bass or even a 48 bass.  If not, you want to look into 12 bass and 24 bass only.It also helps when it comes to buying an accordion.2.) What kind of music do you want to play?You can play a wide variety of music on a piano accordion, but if you want to play Irish button or Cajun -- don't waste your time on a piano accordion only to have to learn a completely new instrument.  Cajun accordions and Irish button are a WORLD of difference.3.) How serious are you?  In other words, if you just want to see how you like it, then I'd actually suggest you just rent one for a week. (depending on where you live, I guess.)But if you know that you want to learn this thing and you'll stick with it a few years, then spend some more money, and definitely get 24 bass.4.) Where do you live?I'll get to why this is important a little later.         ABOUT BUYING ACCORDIONS.Point #1I'm going to say this once, and I'm going to be borderline offensive about it.If you buy your first accordion off Ebay, you've either got shit for brains.   I don't know how else to say it.People selling accordions cheap on Ebay usually are along the lines of ""Found this in my uncle's attic.  Seems to work perfectly.  Has a full keyboard.  $200 plus shipping.""Congratulations.  You just bought yourself a really expensive doorstop.Here's why.I know they're built like air conditioners, but believe it or not, accordions don't age well when they're left on their own.Inside the accordion are three fragile things:  wax/glue, leather strips,  and steel strips.  Lots and lots of steel strips.And when the accordion is stored in an attic or anywhere that's not the correct temperature three things happen.   The wax glue crumbles, the leather curls and the steel rusts.And that, my friend, is expensive to fix.  But if you don't fix it, it's like playing a piano that's been thrown out of tune.  You can't fix it yourself.  You have to hire a pro.Point #2And the above is why it's great if you have played piano before -- because then you can test out the scales.  Play every scale.  The entire circle of fifths.   Then ask the person to play the bass side scales if you're not able to.If you don't know all the scales, see if you can get your hands on an electronic tuner, or a buddy that plays music.Point #3See it in person.   Don't have it shipped to you.   That's why ""where do you live"" is important.  If you live in a remote area, you might not have a lot of accordionists around you.But shipping an accordion is a hideous thing.  You need to dissemble it and have the reeds wrapped separately.   If it's small like a student hohner then it doesn't need to be dissembled, but it does still need to be shipped correctly or the thing WILL, and I mean WILL be damaged in transit.So try to get your hands on the instrument before you buy it.  And if you get it in a shop, you'll know it's properly tuned.And Larry's advice about smelling the accordion for must and bellow leaks.  Always bad signs.On to the accordions...STUDENT HOHNERThe absolute, positive go-to student accordion is the student hohner and if you can  get this one cheap, you should hop on it: student hohner  (sorry, sold mine.)These are German made (mostly-- there are some made in China I've heard.)  These will last.  They're like the Volvos of accordions.   Importantly, when it comes time to sell the accordion, you will probably sell it for what you paid for it.   They're everlasting.CHINESE ACCORDIONSI would definitely buy a new low-end Chinese accordion than buy a used piece of shit.  "
674,"The Chief said that the Army is not yet ready for the role of women in combat arms.All those who propagate this thought, must spend some time in a forward Post and experience the life of a soldier. It is not a ceremonial job or law and order police job. The jawans will only accept you as a leader, when you are physically better than them, can bear all the hardships of life in isolation, be away from family for years, stay alone (as an officer) on a post or patrol with the jawans, be able to handle all types of situations, be able to deal with a drunk or frustrated or a depressed soldier.One should not expect a Lady officer to match a jawan, in physical strength or endurance. In the Army, an officer is always under test, by the jawans. To earn the unstinting respect and obedience of the jawans, in battle, you have to be better than him, in all parameters. You have to be a father figure, a guide and a trustworthy acceptable leader. After all, the soldier has to trust his life in your hands.Lady Officers have served with me in various Units/HQs. They were all very sincere, competent and good. They perform all the duties, including attending PT, Games and Parades. But, it was all in peace stations and in logistic units.In our culture and environment it will take a long time for the jawans to accept a women leader, in battle. Even in the US Army one keeps hearing of cases of unruly behavior, against women combatants.There are a lot of problems faced by both the Lady officers and the Units, in Field Areas, on Exercises, Out Posts, Night guard checking, Field Firing, Out Station duties, Patrolling etc. I can list many issues, which we faced for the safety of the Lady officers, when away on Exercises or during Operation, even in logistic unit.As a junior officer,I remember dealing with soldiers running amuck, insubordination, disobedience, sleeping on duty, intoxicated in barrack, gambling etc. As an only officer, who stays with them on the Post, you have to handle the situation at that time. It is a 24*7*12 job. There are no advisers or police or Human Right activists to fall back up on.My answer is, my question - would you like to send your own daughter to such a job ? Not me, as a soldier, who has seen life in the Army for 35 yrs and being CO of some of the Lady Officers, whom I always appreciated.Therefore, Lady Officers have not been inducted into Combat role. Let us utilise the Lady officers on jobs most suited to them and not politicise or genderise, them to pseudo fantasies of some activists, who have never left their AC offices.It’s strange, we ask special seats for women in buses and trains, special reservation in jobs, special police stations,even special auto-rickshaws, but want them to join combat arms ? All because those who propagate this idea will never go or send their daughters, to the combat arm of the Army. This is firing the gun from others shoulder and claiming the medal for themselves."
675,"Withdrawing high denomination currency notes [demonetization] has been done before [1946, 1978]. However, I believe the present move [2016] might have a bigger impact than the one done by British India and Morarji Desai. This is a move I have been dreaming for years and glad that it was done.The fact that the government was able to do this so secretly in such a connected manner speaks volumes. Indira Gandhi tried this in early 1970s, but could not as the move leaked out and the bad guys quickly changed over the notes. The government had to back out of the move then. I’m even thinking if the move to ban NDTV was just a ploy to distract the whole media, to pull this off. And it was possibly scheduled on US election day likely to get the global media off the heat and attention, as foreign media has been ultracritical & condescending of any major move in India.There are 5 key incentives for this:Bringing out illicit money sloshed stashed in the parallel economyHaving a lid on the fake money racket supported by our western neighborIncentivizing India to go cashless. The banks would not hand you wads of the new cash, but will just credit the money to your bank account in place of your old currency.Moving the notes to a more secure standard - with better protection against counterfeiting.Curbing inflation in real estate and reducing gold imports.As the 6th incentive, it would impact coalitions ahead of the major elections in UP and Punjab. It is not shocking that elections, especially in these states with multidimensional politics [a lot of parties fighting] involve a lot of illicit money. MLAs get traded like horses - with suitcases of cash. Some of that trading will get impacted.Unlike in the past, I don’t see much impact on normal users of currency. The transactions that happen on Rs. 500 and Rs. 1000 should be moving to netbanking/cheque/cards anyway. If someone is still holding out against modern transaction methods, this is the opportunity to come out from under the rock.For the poor who don’t have debit/credit cards, there might not be much impact either - as most of their transaction happen under Rs. 500.Impact of the move1. Black Money & corruption: The impact on black money usage will be temporary as those would eventually move to the new Rs. 2000 notes in time. Also, a lot of the black money lies in real estate, gold and other physical things. Still even a temporary, small impact on this sector is better than nothing. The mere fear of government taking out your black money is good enough. That the government could so secretly do this will increase the fear.2. Elections: Especially with the major elections barely weeks away, the move would impact politics in the crucial states. My guess is that the government waited for the Diwali to pass [will be a huge pain for many to have this move before the festival] and do it reasonably before the elections [EC could throw a spanner on any major move just before the elections]. Thus, unlike the previous occasions, the government didn’t do this on January 16. It could have impact on corruption in those elections and it is a way of the government saying, “Maha Gathbandhan, Check”.3. Counterfeiting: The impact on the counterfeit notes would be more significant. Many “dealers” with the existing counterfeit notes would be stuck as they would have to take the notes to the bank and have better chances of getting their racket exposed. Thus, they are more likely to destroy their notes and incur losses. Losses to the bad guys is good and maybe some of them could get shot unable to pay their debts. It would be quite hard to counterfeit the new currency and until they develop the technology for that, there will be an impact on counterfeit notes and terrorism that is funded through that.4. Cashless society. All of the above things are temporary things. But, I believe the long lasting one could be in moving cashless. The pain of transferring cash could incentivize many to think about going bits and plastic. Today could be a day to introspect for the legal users of the currency. That could have a more significant impact on counterfeiting and unaccounted money.5. Gold/silver. In the short term, gold and silver buying will be hampered, as a lot of the buyers buy with their black money. That means less importing. Over the long term, there might be more purchase of gold as the black money guys will be afraid to hold too much cash.6. Real Estate. In the short term, prices of real estate would come down for the same reason above. There will be less suitcases moving. It is not clear what would happen to this sector in the long term. Maybe there could be a little more land buying, but that could be neutralized by the spiraling down of the prices that could go now.7. Markets. This is overall a positive move that is lauded by a lot of people and could bring more confidence in Indian markets by overseas investors. However, the exit of black money temporarily could cause other repercussions in buying. I would not be surprised if the market goes a bit down in the short and medium term.8. Overseas Indians. There is a lot of INR that gets transacted outside of India. Technically it is illegal [NRIs, foreigners can’t leave with rupee], but there are not many practical alternatives. They would be impacted as they cannot change the money to the new notes quickly and those overseas currency trading markets on rupee would be impacted [UAE money exchanges won’t accept notes in India recall]. Some of these transactions are good ones that improve the economy, while others might help Dawood bhai like ones.9. Banking to all. The government’s key objective is to bring banking to all and this will help that. If you have more than Rs. 4000, the bank will not give you new notes, but will just ask you to open an account and credit it there. This when followed with the fees on ATM transactions will make it harder to transact on cash.10. Consumption and economy. This is one thing I believe it is going to be negative. Black money drives a lot of the economy and now that it is gone, it will impact consumption levels. There could be a deflation and damp economic growth for a couple of quarters. In the long run it doesn’t matter though.Think about this. India’s total tangible wealth is of the order of 280 lakh crores. World bank estimates at least a quarter of this is black. That means 70 lakh crores. It is possible that 10% of it is in cash, with the rest in real estate and gold. That is 7 lakh crores of black cash that is lying around. Maybe 80% of it will turn white and even with that Rs 1.4 lakh crores of black will be gone. That is big.The government gave the black money holders enough time [until Sept 30] to come clean [Black money: Rs. 65,250 crore disclosed under Income Declaration Scheme] and following up on its warnings would make them take the government seriously in this aspect.On the whole, the government has announced that it is alive and bold. At a time it looked like the government was sagging and losing speed, it is a time to reinvigorate."

Bengaluru was actually ""Bendakaalooru"" (land of the boiled beans) and there are many fables associated with how the name came to be.4. Bengaluru has the most number of  engineering colleges so it naturally produces most engineers through out India. 5. Bengaluru has people from all sects and regions living as one. Just go on the road and see the number of vehicles registered in other states and you will know what I mean.6. Even a vegetable vendor is capable of communicating in a minimum of 3 different languages. Kannada, Hindi and English.7. Bengaluru is a Mecca of Multi-Cuisines. You will get food from any region be it hyderbadi,  rajasthani to bengali. Plus there are the international cuisines like Italian,  Chinese,  Thai etc.8. Bengaluru has the highest density of traffic. What with thousands of people thronging the city for opportunities,  falling in love with it and never leaving. 9. Bengalureans are polite,  helpful, friendly, honest and very VERY adaptive. 10. Bengaluru is actually a modern day hill station,  set 3000 feet above sea level thus giving it the most gorgeous weather each day, everyday. Imagine a hill station with tech companies. You are in Bengaluru.P.S: I am kinda tired of answering the ""Oh! PLEASE! Bangalore? The cleanest?"" question. No offense, it is one among the clean cities in India. This can mean Top 5, Top 10, 15 or 20. depending on varying polls and surveys.  Thanks."
677,"Ramananda sai Chilukuri has already discussed about how a child can have A blood group despite both parents having B blood group. Note that in 'A+'  is not a single but a combination of two factors i.e. the A from ABO blood group system and '+'  from Rh factor. As already pointed out,a child can have a different blood group owing to Chimerism https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/...In most cases though, a child may not have  A blood group if both parents have B blood group. How blood group may be determined can be found by drawing a Punnett square following Mendelian genetics. https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/...There can be four cases. Case 1.Father- genotype BO Mother genotype BOResults of offsprings:-25% BB  Phenotype- Blood group B50% BO  Phenotype- Blood group B25% OO  Phenotype- Blood group OCase 2.

678,"Chemistry is comparatively easier than Physics. It is all about formulae. The medical aspirants are always scared of solving math. Physics is all about quantitative analysis whereas Chemistry is only about formulae. Mostly the questions of Chemistry are direct in nature, therefore it is easy to solve. In NEET exam, around 45 questions come from Chemistry, out of which the students have to focus on both class 11 and 12. No one can ignore any chapter across classes. One can omit two or three chapters from where questions do not come usually but that do not mean the students will not focus on those chapters.The ways of preparation• Practice previous year’s test papers for a better understanding of the question patterns. From next year onwards, the National Testing Agency (NTA) is going to conduct NEET examination. Therefore, maybe the difficulty level can be increased, but the syllabus will be the same.• With continuous practice of test papers, the students can understand the question pattern. Even any reputed coaching centre will not give any kind of coming of similar questions. The students can get an idea of the questions, but none of the questions will be similar.• NCERT books will be helpful in understanding what kind of questions come for the exam. With regular practice, one can easily grasp the concepts.• Regular mock tests are another way of preparing yourself. Through mock tests, you can get a variety of questions along with you can manage your time. Time management is another huge area of focus. Within 180 minutes, one has to answer accurately as many questions as required. Therefore, your target will be in answering most of the questions accurately. For securing a seat in a government medical college, you have to score a minimum of 550+ marks. As it is a huge number, then for that you have to score good marks in Chemistry.A detailed analysis of Chemistry question pattern is given belowNEET 2018 Chemistry question paper had 13 easy questions, 21 medium questions and 11 difficult questions.The Chemistry books that you can read to prepare yourself for NEET examinationPhysical ChemistryChemistry XI, XII by NCERTNumerical Chemistry by R C MukherjeeNumerical Chemistry by P.

679,"Thank you for the A2A.The essence of something, is its most authentic state of being.  That thing may express in a variety of ways.  Each of those ways may tempt one to interpret those expressions AS its truest essence.  However, in most cases, this is not the truth, as appearances are born of the expression of this capacity towards multiple expressions, and the perceptual variance of human minds to interpret meaning INTO those things on its own terms.As human beings we are an expression of a more Authentic Self.  That authentic self expresses in a variety of ways through the human lenses of each human self.  Just as a beam of light creates multiple colors through differing color gels, so does the more Authentic Self express as a beam of light through all that we outpicture in our minds, hearts, bodies and life.  It lights a show of ever changing definitions and purposes.Since this expression of being human must have a sense of identity because it doesn't remember its Authentic Self, we have something called the Ego.  This Ego serves to pose challenges to our ability to remember our Authentic self.  We think as the Ego instructs:  that we are separate individuals, that the appearances in this world are the truth, that we are limited, and that pain and struggle is a natural part of our beings. To the Ego, distortions ARE the authentic nature of things.  This creates our confrontation with a powerful teacher at every turn.  One that denies our Authentic self in order to strengthen our capacity to realize it.The Ego desires that you self define via what you experience.  Within that beautiful crystalline radiance that enlivens the colors is the Consciousness of love, joy, fearlessness, freedom, peace and creative largess.  That Cosmic Consciousness IS that light, and that which enlivens the gels of this creation.  Our journey here then, upon this world called earth which is for us each a school, is to awaken within ourselves the awareness of the nature and being of our AUTHENTIC self.  It is to arrive at the point in which one has the expanse of awareness to admit new possibility concerning self and reality.This journey is the essence of spirituality.  Spirit as that beam of light flowing through distortions that challenge us to see its purity.  The colors intoxicate and we long to identify with them, even though they bring pain and sorrow ultimately.  That longing and the experiencing of the nature of the colors and how they define us as 'the truth', is what is called the human dream.  We dance upon the periphery of reality, creating a placeholder for reality out of our own definitions of truth.  Our destiny in this expansive universe, and the will of that pure Consciousness is to awaken from that dream and experience the joy and cherished unity with that Consciousness that is our AUTHENTIC SELF.Since that light gives capability to those colors, that light, in its purest essence is now within us now.  We need go nowhere to find it, as were it not within us, neither would be the colors of our existence.   Our journey then, is to go within, and not into the world of colors to find the answer.   It is to realize the  power to awaken the ability through focus and intention, longing and love.  It is to distinguish the pure light from the colors and to realize that the most Authentic expression of all that shines into this world, is that magnificent Consciousness that cannot be defined by any color it enables.  A mound of golden jewelry:  chains, watches, bracelets, pins, necklaces, rings, etc, is a mound of things that have a truer authentic essence.  That would be the gold.  Not one of those things defines the gold, only its own purpose.  The forms express in ways that entice us to see them as THE reality.  They are passing forms dancing upon ONE authentic thing.We begin to seek.  Eventually that authentic truth within, adhering to the expansive nature of the universe, quickens, creating forms of discomfort with how we are seeing life and ourselves.  We eventually set out to  energetically awaken tools within that make this journey of awakening victorious.  We set 'OUT'  upon a journey of freedom from a painful dream, by focusing 'Within'.  The pain we feel in this dream, in its most authentic essence, is believed separation from our source expressing in a million different scenarios and experiences as provided by the many colors of the dream gels.That is the essence of spirituality.   One begins, in their own time, to awaken from the human dream, prompted by their authentic essence, which acts upon universal will that we are unleashed like a galaxy of stars to claim the beauty and ancient wisdom of divine Consciousness with nothing standing in the way."
680,"Quora might hope that you use Quora for all knowledge searches.I would suggest you use Google when you are seeking information and Quora when you are seeking explanation.Whether it is bad depends on perspective.  Quora wants to own a database with all of the world's knowledge so they can convert that into a boatload of money.  So, of course they welcome people asking those simple questions.  I think it can be bad from the perspective of the users.  It clutters the feed with crap.  I expect my feed to be filled with content that will be interesting to read, not simplistic factoids that can be found anywhere.  Encouraging easy questions on Quora makes Quora a less enjoyable place for me.I don't understand why people do it.  It just doesn't make any kind of sense to me.  Why would someone come to Quora, click on add question, type their question, click through all of the prompts about topics and being sure the question hasn't already been asked and then wait a few hours for the question to make it into the feed of someone willing to answer it, when they could just type the question in their browser search bar and get an immediate answer from Google?There are some questions that Google can handle much better than Quora can.  It can provide a better, more concise, vetted answer and in an instant.  Quora should stick to specializing on what it does better than Google - provide direct contact with people that understand something, so a conversation can happen to bring that understanding to others.A year ago, there was an annoying series of questions each asking for the name of the actor that played a specific character in the 1970s-1980s television sitcom M*A*S*H.  One after another, the questions worked their way through the whole cast.  ""Who played Nurse Houlihan on MASH?"", ""Who played BJ Honeycutt on MASH?"", on through to  ""Who played Hawkeye Pierce on MASH?""Typing that into Google provides:What could a Quora member possibly provide that would improve on that answer?  No amount of expertise or experience will provide a more accurate or precise answer than Alan Alda.  No amount of literary flourish will make that answer more effective.  I used this example on one of the Quora Facebook groups and another member vigorously disagreed.  They said that you never know when one of the Quora members that comes across that simplistic question might actually have something to share, such as they grew up on the same street as Alan Alda and have a story to share.  And that, they said, was the justification to allow such basic questions on Quora.My view is - no.  If people want a story about Alan Alda, they should ask for it.  Maybe something like ""What are anecdotes about Alan Alda that Quora members can share?""It just makes no sense.  If someone is seeking stories about Alan Alda, they aren't going to type ""Who played Hawkeye Pierce on MASH?"" in the Quora search field.I want to see thoughtful questions in my feed so that I can read thoughtful answers and I can write thoughtful answers.  Question askers have as much responsibility to maintain quality on Quora as answerers do.  So, yes, I think it is bad to ask questions on Quora that could be easily answered on Google. It's your responsibility to ask better questions on Quora."

In the movie, DiCaprio’s Belfort teaches his sales team their first lesson by pulling out a pen and saying, “sell me this pen.” One character takes the pen and asks Jordan to write his name in a napkin. Jordan doesn’t have anything to write with and has to ask for a pen. Boom. He made the sale.Here the Strategy - Creating an Urgency made the sale.But, the truth is - This strategy hardly works for remaining salesLet's consider the same scenario and try selling it a better way with - Insight Selling. Insights gives a better decision making power for both Buyer and Seller Which in turn helps in having a win-win situation.With Insights selling:Seller can have the better knowledge about the problem (pain) areas.Buyer can have the information about the solution seller is having to solve his problem and can help them in building customer-centric productsNow, let's get back to selling the pen: Couple of questions the seller should have in mind.If buyer is not having a pen earlier - What can be the reason for not having a pen? -1.

The above speaks about one side of it. But, the other side is - Selling remains same across the industries and products - But, the approach, perspective, volume of targeted customers, your product potential, the problem it's solving and other factors will make the major difference in Selling.

Gold is not currency or a negotiable instrument unless it is in gold coins from the USA or another country.   There is also no duty on importing gold.  So, with the exception of gold coins that are legal tender somewhere, there is not only no limit on how much may be imported or exported, you might not even have to file a special form -- but if over your duty-free limit, you do have to declare the gold on entry on the standard customs form.  Nothing is required on exit.The USA is only one country.  Other countries certainly may have different rules."

685,"The design, UI, and even UX of a site embody a host of different forms of intellectual property (i.e. copyrights, patents, and trade secrets), and each require different types of protection. I'll keep this fairly general and high level.Copyrights - Things such as your site's content (whether it's images, sounds, written material, etc), your code (both source and object), and any other documents you have on the site are all protectable under copyright law.  You automatically own the copyright of any original expression of an idea in a fixed, tangible format (i.e. once you ""put pen to paper""). Nothing else needs to be done for you to own this copyright, though it's not a bad idea to put a ""©"" on your site to put the public on notice of your copyright on the materials. You can also register your copyright with the U.S. Copyright office -- this is completely voluntary and not required, though it does provide you with some benefits, especially if a dispute arises down the road.Patents - Ignoring mine or anyone else's personal feelings on software patents, the current system allows for them and you might as well play within the system. First, you have two kinds of patents to consider: Design, which covers a product's (in this case a website) appearance, and Utility, which covers any new and useful idea embodied in your website -- generally, things your website does. Design patents are cheaper to get, but also provide substantially less protection. If you feel like you have a super unique UI (think iOS UI or Google's homepage, both of which have design patent protection), you can consider filing for a design patent.  On the plus side, design patents are substantially cheaper to get than utility patents, and for some folks, there's something to be said about having granted patents in their portfolio. That said, the downside is that design patents are relatively easy to get around. More likely, you'll be concerned with utility patent protection.  This protects something unique that your website does (or will do) -- the minimum threshold is that the function is new (never been done) and useful (does it have some use?).  I also say ""or will do"" because, unlike copyrights, you can patent your idea without having created a tangible form of it.  If you believe your site does or will do something unique and groundbreaking, it's not a bad idea to consult a patent attorney about whether you can patent it. If you have serious financial constraints (i.e. most early stage companies), you can consider filing for a provisional patent application -- which gives you a one-year ""placeholder"" for you to decide whether you can/should file the utility patent application.  A provisional is much cheaper to file than a utility application -- just understand that if you don't file a utility application within one year of the date on which you filed a provisional, the provisional goes away and you're back at square one.  As for costs associated with the process of getting a utility patent application granted by the U.S. Patent Office, there are a number of factors that affect cost, but it can get into the five-figure range (when adding in all Patent Office fees, attorney fees, other various fees).Just be aware of one additional thing re: patents -- once you've shown  an idea to the public or offered a product up for sale, you have exactly  one year from the first day you publicized that idea to file either a  provisional or utility patent application.  After that, it's considered  free for anyone to use.  Your one-year clock may already be ticking.Trade Secrets - Trade secrets are your company's ""secret sauce."" The underlying reason for having a patent system is to incentivize the sharing of innovations (after all, almost all innovations are built on some existing innovation). So with patents, the U.S. government grants you a 20 year period during which you can exclude others from using your idea, but you only get that exclusivity in exchange for your sharing your idea with the world (via a patent application).  If you think your idea will be relevant for a long time (think Coca Cola formula, Google's search algorithm), you should consider not filing for a patent at all and taking precautions to prevent disclosure of your trade secret.All this said, if you're a startup company with a great idea for a site, building the best possible site and getting a ton of users should always be your primary objective. I can't stress this enough. Don't spend too much of your time on IP protection. Consulting with a patent attorney is a good, prudent first step -- they can generally give you advice on all aspects of intellectual property protection and steer you in the right direction."
686,"You have asked, ""Why is C++ Hard?"" Learning programming from the top down can make C++ harder to learn. Familiarity with languages such as Python, JavaScript, Visual Basic, Java, C#, and Ruby on Rails can give you an incomplete picture of software development. When those languages and others like them are your only introduction to writing code, C++ will be hard.C++ is not in the same class. C++ is unique and special, like C. That uniqueness, that special nature makes it harder to pick up and apply.Easy and QuickThe main purpose of Python, JavaScript, Visual Basic, Java, C#, Ruby and languages like them is to do one thing. Save the programmer time writing code and create an end result with as less fuss and difficulty as possible. A working program done fast is more important in those languages than a rigorous software development process. You can add structure, but the core of those languages is such that additional structure is optional.Many languages are designed, on purpose, to be easy and quick.The pinnacle, and state-of-the-art of C++ programming is the total opposite of this:The purpose of C++ is much different.The ChameleonPeople hesitate to say about C++ that it is a chameleon language. A chameleon is a type of reptile whose entire skin is designed to match the thing it is on. The animal mascot for C and C++ should be the chameleon. The reason is the main purpose of those languages is to match the machine they run on.This is C++ relative to most other languages.Complexity of a ChameleonWhen people look at chameleons, we think they are so awesome as a concept. How can a creature in nature just change their skin like that, blend in, and be one with nature so much as to evade destruction? We cannot understand it, because that is not how people's bodies work. A chameleon is complicated from the outside. However, to a chameleon, how they are is simple to them. They know exactly (or at least automatic instinct) to change form, sit motionless, and be the thing their skin is emulating.C++ as a ChameleonLike the chameleon, C++ matches the computer. That includes the hardware and the operating system. This morphing doesn't happen automatically. Shaping the code to be that way, has to occur on purpose. You are writing code in C++ that is balanced to both the machine and your intended operational process at the same time. The other languages only emphasize that second part so when you meet C++ for the first time, there is an entire realm of possibly unfamiliar technology concepts that throws you off.Making Matters WorseWorking with C++, you see this chameleon nature but may not understand it. Things get more difficult when you try to ignore it and apply C++ in the same way as other languages. If you do pure C++ 14 and C++ 17, you can get closer except the C++ standards bodies are moving away from the way people code today. Next generation C++ is going to be even more foreign because it is state-of-the-art. Regardless of today or tomorrow, the missing element that makes C++ hard is when you decide to ignore machine architecture.Machine ArchitectureI respect the advice of experts but will say no, you cannot just learn C++ 14 or C++ 17 as the next thing to replace Java, C#, and Ruby on Rails. You will have to commit yourself to knowledge of machine architecture and how that relates to concepts such as pointers in C and C++, memory management, and so on. Otherwise, you end up with mysterious situations that challenge you and your ability to revise code and manage it. Compilers will then constantly give you feedback that amounts to endless rejection.C++ is really about the machine and whatever real-world idea you would encode.Functions and FlexibilityC++ is not an object-oriented programming language. The inventor of C++ has hinted at that for years. The hint is ignored. Unfortunately, not even the inventor of C++ can get people to rea..."
687,"NO. Raspberry Pi is insufficient considering the current difficulty level. Yeah the Pi is cheap, but do the calculations and see…easy to Bing or Google…what is the difficulty level and what is your energy consumption.I have 10 GPU miners (6 GPUs per miner) and am earning close to $10000 a month. That has returned my initial investment in just 6 months and now it is pure profit…until I need to upgrade to the latest GPUs.SO, DO THE MATH.

I felt that the top two movies by critics (Moonlight and La La Land) were good, but very Hollywood-y and not really to my taste — high quality, but not my favorites. My top movies are of 2017 are:Excellent (9/10)#1 Arrival (critics: #4)#2 I Am Not Your Negro (critics #25)#3 Manchester by the Sea (critics #3)Great (8/10)#4 Hell or High Water (critics #4)#5 Hunt For the Wilderpeople (critics #36)#6 Captain Fantastic (critics #40)#7 Moana (critics #48)I’ve really enjoyed watching the top 25 and encourage people to do it if they enjoy cinema.The full list of year’s movies are:1. Moonlight Effective #1.1 (IMDB)A young man deals with his dysfunctional home life and comes of age in Miami during the ""War on Drugs"" era. The story of his struggle to find himself is told across three defining chapters in his life as he experiences the ecstasy, pain, and beauty of falling in love while grappling with his own sexuality.My opinion: This movie has great supporting roles which were really the highlight of the movie. I found that the three different eras had such different feelings, issues, and vibes that it more felt like three short films rather than one coherent movie. You do get a three dimensional picture of the main character, but I personally didn’t find him that compelling — aloof and distant would be the words I would use to describe him. My rating 6/10.2. La La Land Effective #1.8 (IMDB)A jazz pianist falls for an aspiring actress in Los Angeles.My opinion: Except for the Academy, apparently, I’m the only person that didn’t adore this movie. I found it alright. I love the cinematography, particularly the use of color. I don’t get much out of the dancing and find that it takes away from my enjoyment of films (this is personal preference). I didn’t particularly like the characters and the story was pretty derivative. So this is expertly made, but not made for me. 5/10.3. Manchester by the Sea Effective #2.1 (IMDB)An uncle is forced to take care of his teenage nephew after the boy's father dies.My opinion: This movie is heart rending. The acting is spectacular. I have two main issues. The first is that Lee’s character doesn’t really take an arc. This makes the film see like its treading water. This is realisitic, but ultimately makes it seem unfulfilling at some level. It could have been a shot at the end showing some appreciation, or some level of catharsis. The second thing I didn’t love was the cinematography, which felt a bit cheap. Some of the shots were done with bad conditions. There was a lack of clarity in some of the shots and a general feeling that the film looked digital. Small quibbles, but it left me with a final score of 9/10.4. Arrival Effective: #4.4 (IMDB)Linguistics professor Louise Banks (Amy Adams) leads an elite team of investigators when gigantic spaceships touch down in 12 locations around the world. As nations teeter on the verge of global war, Banks and her crew must race against time to find a way to communicate with the extraterrestrial visitors. Hoping to unravel the mystery, she takes a chance that could threaten her life and quite possibly all of mankind.My opinion: This is one of the best science fiction movies of all time. It has unique takes on the characters involved with an alien encounter. The use of time is something that I haven’t seen in a movie before. 9/105. Hell or High Water Effective #5.4 (IMDB)Toby is a divorced father who's trying to make a better life for his son. His b..."

If some comments or points seem out of place, I was probably referring to something relevant to my original asker.———————————————————————————————————————————That’s awesome! Dogs love to be mentally stimulated, so good on you for wanting to teach your dog new things.In dog training, there are basically two main areas that you want to spend your time learning about, even if only briefly:Classical conditioning:Where dogs make associations between things subconsciously (the famous Pavlov’s dogs experiment).This isn’t exactly what you’re looking for, so I won’t spend too much time on it right now, but it can be incredibly useful to know, because it’s constantly at play. I thought I’d throw it in for the sake of completion.What you should look into is Operant Conditioning:Every police K9, military working dog, bomb sniffer and TV canine actor you’ve seen has been trained via operant conditioning.This opens up the dog’s world to the concept of consequences. For any particular behaviour your dog performs, he may be reinforced or punished for it.Reinforcement: the promotion of a behaviour, in order to increase its likelihood of happening again.Punishment: the discouragement of a behaviour in order to decrease its likelihood of happening again.Further still, you can give(+) or take something away(-) from the dog in each case, referred to as positive and negative respectively So now we have this:Positive reinforcement: Giving your dog something desirable, in order to reward and promote a behaviour, eg. praising him for coming to you.Negative reinforcement: Taking something aversive away from your dog in order to reward and promote a behaviour, eg. removing pressure from their neck when they do what you want them to (old school dog training method).Positive punishment: Giving or applying something aversive to your dog to penalise and discourage a behaviour, eg. using traditional prong and choke collars to apply pressure to their neck when they do something you don’t like.Negative punishment: Taking something desirable away from your dog to penalise or discourage a behaviour, eg. turning your back when he jumps up for attention.These are the basic building blocks in dog training, and with them you can teach your dog pretty much anything they’re physically capable of doing.Timing is essential, because dogs live in the moment - so you want to reinforce or punish within seconds of the behaviour occurring, otherwise it’s a wasted effort.Consistency is everything in dog training. Whether you’re actively trying to train him or not, he’s always learning through classical and operant conditioning, so it’s good to be aware of how you’re behaving around your dog.Note: Negative reinforcement and positive punishment are best left to professionals, or people with a really solid understanding of these concepts, as there can be fallout when using aversive techniques if you aren’t careful - including increased fear, anxiety and aggression.Spend your time brushing up on positive reinforcement and negative punishment and you’ll be golden.Look at books like 101 dog tricks or 101 Puppy Tricks if you’d like to learn step-by-step how to teach particular tricks to your dog. I’ve bought them myself and it’s a wonderful resource for teaching all sorts of neat and hilarious things.If you’d like to learn more, I’ve written a more in-depth guide here and also made an visual guide here.Hope this helps!ReferencesReid, P.

701,"Turkeys and chickens are both edible fowl that are commonly found in many areas. Their flavor is similar, but there are still many differences between the two birds.TaxonomyTurkeys and chicken share a similar taxonomy, and are the same up until the subfamily category. Both belong to the Animalia kingdom, the Chordata phylum , the Aves class, and the Galliformes order. However, the turkey is in the Phasianidae subfamily, with the genus being Meleagris. There are two distinct species-Meleagris gallopavo, which is the common domestic or wild turkey, and the Meleagis ocellata, or the ocellated turkey which is native to the Yucatan Peninsula in Mexico.Report this adLike the turkey, the chicken also belongs to the Animalia kingdom, the Chordata phylum, the Aves class, and the Galliformes order. However, it is a part of the Phasianinae subfamily, the Gallus genus, and the subspecies pf Gallus gallus domesticus. This is the species commonly known as the domesticated chicken.HistoryTurkey fossils have been found beginning in the Early Miocene era onward, all of which originated in North America. They were imported into Europe primarily by merchants from the country of Turkey, which is how they became known as turkey birds or turkeys.The domestic chicken is descended from the red junglefowl and they were first domesticated for cockfighting in Asia, Africa and Europe. There is a claim that they were first domesticated in Southern China as early as 6000 BC, but it is not clear as to whether those birds are actually related to the modern domestic chicken. They were considered a rare food in ancient Greece, but breeding of chickens increased under the Roman Empire, and they were also considered to be a sacred animal and were used as oracles. There is still a lack of data as to how the chicken spread to many regions of the world, but it has become a staple food source in many different counties.AppearanceTurkeys and chickens are relatively easy to distinguish based upon their physical appearance and characteristics. Turkeys are larger in size than chickens, usually by about 10 to 15 pounds, and will have very long tail feathers. They are also darker in color than chickens with no feathers on their neck and head. Turkey eggs are a tan or brown color.ChickenReport this adChickens are usually smaller than turkeys. The hens can be colorful or white, with roosters having striking plumage with long flowing tails and shiny, pointed feathers on their necks and backs. These feathers are usually a brighter color than what is found on hens. Roosters also have a large comb on the top of their head, hanging flaps of skin on either side of their beak called wattles, and will develop spurs on their legs. Chickens will have feathers on their head and necks, and their eggs are typically white in color.As foodBoth turkeys and chickens are eaten in many different areas of the world. They do have different flavors as well as nutritional differences. The meat from both birds contains vitamin B6 and niacin, which may be helpful in protecting against Alzheimer’s disease and general age-related mental decline. Both B6 and niacin can help support energy metabolism in the body. Turkey is relatively low in saturated fat and contains riboflavin, phosphorous, protein and selenium. It also contains the antioxidant zinc, which is useful as an immunity booster and helps regulate endocrine function and hormone levels. Turkey meat does have high cholesterol and sodium levels though. It is commonly eaten throughout the year in the US and Canada, and is the traditional meal served at Thanksgiving.Chicken tends to have more calories, fat, and cholesterol than turkey, but it also contains more omega fatty acids and protein. The typical serving of chicken breast meat contains about 165 calories, while turkey breast meat contains only 104. Chicken has less sodium and is also a good source of phosphorus, and selenium. Selenium can improve the body’s immune system when fighting against bacterial and viral infections, against cancer cells and the herpes virus. It also increases the good cholesterol, HDL, resulting in healthier heart function. Like turkey, it is also high in cholesterol.RearingTurkeys are generally wild, although raising them in domestic environments is becoming increasingly common. Commercial varieties of turkeys are also fast-growing. They require a high-protein diet. The modern turkey is a hybrid that is larger than wild varieties. This typically requires artificial insemination in commercial operations, which also allows for selective breeding with more females selected than males. This will lead to higher rates of hatchability. For breeding stock, the poults (baby turkeys) will be raised under environmentally-controlled conditions for 28 weeks, during which time the females grow to be about 24-30 pounds while the males will grow to 50-70 pounds. At 28 weeks, the females will typically begin producing eggs and will lay for about the next 26 weeks. In that time, they will lay about 100-130 eggs. The eggs are incubated and hatched. Once they reach a desired weight, the birds are transported for processing.Most chickens are also raised in a commercial setting for their meat and eggs. They mature at a faster rate than turkeys, taking only about 14 weeks to reach a size in which they could be processed. Chickens can also lay more eggs than turkeys, with some hens being able to lay over 300 eggs per year. Some chickens are kept"

703,"Origins of CSThe primary difference is that computer science was originally a sub-branch of mathematics. This is now known as theoretical computer science. Modern applied computer science deals with algorithms and software. Where hardware is studied it is only to inform the design and development of algorithms and software. As such computer science can either be extremely mathematical and focus only on graph theory, combinatorics, computational complexity theory, axiomatic set theory and propositional logic. OR it can be more applied as is the case almost universally in university programmes.Origins of CEComputer engineering has very different origins as a sub-branch of electronic engineering, which itself is a sub-branch of electrical engineering. Electrical engineering itself emerged as a specialisation from engineering science at the turn of the 20th century.In fact, even within electronic engineering the field of computer engineering emerges as a sub-branch of digital electronics. This is generally regarded as the ""easier"" electronics in the field, and stands in sharp contrast to analogue electronics which is legendarily difficult. Difficulty of CS vs CEI agree with the first half of answer Ken's answer but I don't entirely agree with his views on what's harder and what's not. It is true that in many countries engineering degrees tend to be harder or more rigorous than science degrees because it is, simultaneously, a science degree while also aiming to certify the practitioner and satisfy the professional requirements for admission to whatever necessary governing bodies. In the UK the engineering degrees are designed to be both academic enough to serve as a platform for further research while also meeting the stringent requirements to receive the title of Chartered Engineer with IMechE, IChemE, IEE (now, IET), etc. Hence, professionally accredited degrees in the UK are the BEng or MEng rather than the BSc or MSc. (Though an MEng is fundamentally different from an MSc too, but let's not get into that.)But as far as the fields themselves are concerned I don't think a broad generalization can be made. Some topics in computer science are of extraordinary difficulty. In fact the P vs NP problem in computer currently stands as one of the greatest open problems in mathematics. The solution of which would guarantee a Fields Medal. Though, engineering science has its own equally difficult open problems such as the Yang-Mills existence and mass gap which is in the domain of electrical engineering, and the Navier-Stokes existence and smoothness problem which is in fluid mechanics. (These three are Millenium Prize problems.)Certainly, web development and database design can be considered ""easier"" than, say, VLSI or transmission line analysis, so ""computer science"" can be said to have easier topics, however there are also many very difficult topics in the field. (Furthermore, I question the classification of such topics as computer science. True computer science is theoretical computer science.)Difficulty of CE vs EEEOne idea in Ken's answer that I reject is the idea that computer engineering is somehow more difficult than electrical engineering. This cannot be the case when one contains the other. Furthermore, this cannot be the case when computer engineering traditionally avoids or glosses over some of the most difficult topics in the field with which students struggle the most. These being, engineering electromagnetics and analogue electronics. One could call computer engineering a specialisation within digital electronics, and digital electronics is orders of magnitude easier and better understood than analogue.PickingIn my case, I intentionally avoided picking the sub-specialization of computer engineering and stuck  to general EEE because I found several of the easier courses were in the CE specialization, and because I had encountered most of the CE specific courses in CS. E.g. I really didn't need yet another course about networks. The one on designing radio telescopes was much more interesting.One thing I must point out, however. It is a lot easier to teach yourself computer science than it is to teach yourself computer engineering because there is less of a strong reliance on background/prerequisites between topics in CS and less experimentation with real-world phenomena that can behave unpredictably -- I can't count the number of times an analogue signal conditioning circuit was displaying fine on the oscilloscope before lunch but mysteriously stopped working after. So if you want to have less limits, study computer engineering and fill in the gaps of whatever area of CS or software engineering that you need."
704,"When you're using a reliable form of birth control.Pregnancy can only occur if sex occurs during fertile days of the menstrual cycle - fertile days include ovulation and up to a week prior to ovulation when fertile cervical mucus may be present. Ovulation is when an egg is released from the ovary which typically occurs 14 days before menstruation, there may be a viable egg for up to 48 hours. Fertile cervical mucus protects the sperm from the acidic pH of the vagina and helps it to swim up through the cervix to go on to the fallopian tubes where they wait for ovulation - sperm could live in the vagina for up to seven days.It is possible to accurately determine when a person is fertile in order to time sex during a point in the menstrual cycle when there is no pregnancy risk - this is done by monitoring primary fertility signs such as basal body temperature, fertile cervical mucus, and cervical changes, also secondary fertility signs unique to the individual can be used too. Using observations of all fertility signs is known as Symptothermal Method (can be used in Fertility Awareness Method or Natural Family Planning - the former method allows other birth control methods to be used too, the latter method teaches abstinence during the fertile window) - this method is up to 98% effective. Unless using FAM/NFP you cannot know when a person could be fertile as even someone with the most regular cycles will have a few days variation in their cycle from time to time, and those few days difference could be enough to result in pregnancy. If sexually active you need to use some form of birth control if you wish to prevent unintended pregnancy, this is something that you should discuss with your partner. "

709,"A software engineer succeeded in keeping under wraps the murder of his wife for two months but the law finally caught up with him on Sunday night. After a spat on the night of October 17, 2010 Rajesh Gulati (37) allegedly smothered his 36-year-old wife Anupama Gulati to death in their two-room rented house at Prakash Nagar in Dehradun Cantonment. To cover up the heinous crime, Rajesh bought an electric cutter from the market and chopped off the body into 70 pieces. Then he bought a deep freezer to stash away body pieces. Police sources said Rajesh also bought a bundle of black polythene carrybags to store the body parts. He had planned to secretly dump them at remote locations on Dehradun-Mussoorie road. When his four-year-old kids — twins Sonakshi and Sidhant — would enquire about their mother, Rajesh would tell them that she was away in Delhi. The murder came to light on Sunday morning when Anupama's elder brother, SK Pradhan, reached Dehradun and sent a friend to his sister's house with Anupama's passport. Suspecting foul play after they were unable to locate her, he lodged a missing complaint with the police. Acting swiftly, a joint team of Uttarakhand Special Task Force (STF) and Special Operations Group (SOG) conducted a raid at the techie's residence and cracked the case. Dehradun SSP G S Martolia said the police team recovered severed parts of the body, including Anupama's head, from the deep freezer after sustained interrogation of the accused. According to SSP Martolia, the culprit was taken to the shops from where he had bought the stone-cutter electric machine, polythene carrybags and deep freezer. He was also taken to spots where he had disposed off body parts. The accused is reported to have confessed to his crime. Narrating the sequence of events, IG (Garhwal Range) M A Ganpati said that on the night of the incident Rajesh slapped his wife after a domestic quarrel. ''He told us that she fell on the corner of a wall after which she became unconscious. A jittery Rajesh thinking that his wife, after regaining consciousness, would report the matter to the police decided to kill her. And then he throttled her by thrusting cotton into her nose and mouth before using pillow to kill her,'' said Ganpati. Rajesh was later remanded in a four-day police remand by the court of Dehradun chief judicial magistrate (CJM) Kunwar Amrindra Singh.Source: TOI "
710,"SPEED, BANDWIDTH & LATENCY – now demystifiedThe best way to explain these terms is by using an analogy.Imagine bandwidth like a freeway, where all cars (here ‘data’) travel at the same speed.To receive more data from the internet and make your downloads faster, the freeway needs to be ‘wider’. In other words, say 1 Mbps is equivalent to 1 lane freeway. Now if you are trying to download a 5 Mb image, and you have a bandwidth of 1 Mbps, it would take you roughly 5 seconds to download the image.Now let’s say that you have a 5 Mbps (bandwidth) connection or a 5 lane freeway. How fast will you receive your image? 1 second.Simply, more bandwidth means that you’ll have access to high-speed data in a given time. In this situation, you can download 5 images with the wider bandwidth in the same amount of time you could 1 with a narrower bandwidth.Now, it doesn’t necessarily mean that internet speed is any higher at 1 Mbps or 5 Mbps and above. It’s simply processing of your data becomes faster due to a wider bandwidth where more data can be sent simultaneously. It’s more efficient, making your internet perceptually faster, not technically faster.In other words, it means that you ‘are made to sense the immediate experience of faster downloads with promises like 5 Mbps ‘speed’, when it actually is a question of both bandwidth and latency.Latency in simple terms means delay.It is usually measured in milliseconds or ms and is the amount of delay (or time) it takes to send information from one point to another.Understanding latency in times of 4GPresent-day networks have achieved impressive speeds with 4G Long Term Evolution networks connecting subscribers and applications 100 times faster than 2G networks. With the coming of new-age technology, network speeds will only increase in the future. However, network performance is not only about speed.Networks that have the better bandwidth (read wider space) and low latency (read less delay) will be able to pass benefits to the subscribers in this age of digital transformation.A small country like Australia has been up-and-coming with improved speeds due to ""big network investments from telecom companies such as Telstra and Vodafone[1] "". They have now risen three places to rank seventh globally on average download speeds, and 13th globally in terms of 4G availability.4G as an offering today comes with lower latency levels; decreased latency levels are defining moments in use, permitting innovative concepts like AI, VR and IoT to flourish.How is latency different from bandwidth and speed?Imagine a pipe.Bandwidth has to do with how wide or narrow the pipe isLatency has to do with the contents of the pipe and how fast it moves from one end to the otherLatency is a way to measure the speedRole and relevance of latency todayMany applications in Virtual Reality and Augmented Reality had not realized their full potential prior to high-speed networks; innovative concepts couldn’t leave the design stage because high latency punctured the very idea of a solution.For example, the success of driverless automobiles depends entirely on the communication backbone and its performance. For a driverless car to weave in and out of high-speed bumper to bumper traffic, it needs to be plugged into a network that will offer connectivity with lowest latency levels. A delay in transmitting and receiving a signal or an input can be disastrous on the roads where split-second reflexes rule the roads.Similarly, IoT is being deployed in healthcare today. Many automated medical devices are now equipped to provide verbal training about a procedure and reminders of when users should take prescribed medication, check blood pressure, or exercise. The problem is that the things (e.g., sensors, gadgets, controls, etc.) of the IoT depend on the responsiveness of a system or network to work effectively. High latency means delayed responsiveness. With delayed responsiveness, comes the inability of the things to function to their full capacity.Since the majority of technology emerging today is about making the experience immersive for the audience, this value-chain simply can’t afford lags.Delays could realistically mean the difference between life and death, which is also why major ‘breakthroughs’ in technology evolve over a certain time.Networks need to ensure that all channels are effectively up and running—cameras, Radar, Sonar, GPS and Lidar. Split second connectivity is the key to the success of driverless cars and this cannot be achieved by merely increasing bandwidth. Advanced collision prevention systems, pedestrian detection technology, brake assist[2] and similar solutions can be truly effective only when latency is low.Gaining the edgeUsers would certainly not like to enjoy downloads that occur at high speeds, pause in between and resume, with the cycle continuing. And applications will end up turning counterproductive if latency levels impact the delivery of solutions.Networks need to offer connectivity where the response time is below hundreds of milliseconds. Beyond these thresholds, users experience lag and this affects the overall experience.For a seamless experience total latency needs to be reduced to lower levels. Networks need to be committed to improving user experience and serve application needs better with higher network speeds, qualified by lower latency levels.[1] https://www.zdnet.com/article/op...[2] https://www.cabotsolutions.com/2..."

There is no speciality department you can do work in but because of that you learn to know basic things more rather than indulging yourself in things which are not helping you as an MBBS.After internship in Hindu Rao, you can just stand anywhere and proudly say that yes i am a Doctor and knows many basic things which most people lacks.Everyone is friendly in here and get to know a lot of new people( that's the beat part i think)."

713,"There is a constant need for better quality production procedures in mechanized sector of textile industry. Hence, companies prefer hiring candidates specialized in this domain. It is one of the most demanded careers as there is always a need of better fire resistant materials, material for medical use and weather resistant packaging materials etc.Candidates with a degree in Textile Engineering can get involved in textile chemistry that is responsible for coming up with different types of fabrics with specific properties. Apart from this, a textile engineer also works in quality department to monitor the production processes to ensure the produced product is of superior quality. In a nutshell, the scope and growth in this field is immense."
714,"Fastest could mean a lot of different things.People have posted a lot of cars on here that are the fastest production cars, but probably not the fastest cars that are road-legal. Tuner cars can be faster than even the fastest hypercar, because there’s really no need to worry about reliability, aesthetics, or ease-of-manufacture.There are two different good definitions of “fast” where I can start looking for road-legal cars: Top speed and acceleration.Top speed for a production car is easy; that’s just how fast a car goes. The fastest “production” car is the Bugatti Veyron Super Sport, which reaches a top speed of 267.85 mph (431.06 kph):It gets a little harder if you want to find the top speed of a road legal car. Most top speed racing doesn’t check that the car is road-legal, so it’s hard to verify a record. However, I’m going to use the Modified- and Factory-class Bonneville Salt Flats records, which are maintained by the Southern California Timing Association. The fastest record that I could find for a modified production car was by a 1990’s Pontiac Trans-Am running nitrous injection (and probably a motor swap) at 308.98 mph (497.26 kph):For acceleration, the most reliable measure of “fastest” would be a 1/4-mi (400m) drag race. People like to quote 0–60 mph (0–100 kph) times, but tuner cars have become so fast that the difference is hard to measure accurately.Just for fun, the fastest production car 0–60 mph is the Porsche 918 Spyder, at 2.2 sec, followed closely enough to mention by the Tesla Model S P100D Ludicrous+ at 2.28 sec:The fastest production car to do a 1/4 mile is, again, the Bugatti Veyron Super Sport, and it does it in 9.7 sec (speed unlisted, but probably ~150 mph):The fastest 1/4 mile by a road legal car is a very sought-after record in the USA, and tends to change from year to year, and sometimes month-to-month. In 2016 it was held by a modified 1969 Chevrolet Camaro, which ran a quarter-mile in 5.85 sec at 251 mph:To all the naysayers of this particular record (the car certainly doesn’t look road-legal), this car participates in an event called Hot Rod Drag Week. All Drag Week vehicles are required to drive under their own power from track to track to compete. It is registered and completely road-legal, and you can see the registration sticker in the windshield on videos of it running.Hope that answers your question!"
715,"How Neodymium Magnets are madeNeodymium Iron Boron is an alloy made mainly from a combination of Neodymium, Iron, Boron, Cobalt and varying levels of Dysprosium and Praseodymium.The exact chemical composition within NdFeB depends on the grade of NdFeB. Dysprosium and Praseodymium are added as a replacement for some of the Neodymium to improve the corrosion resistance and to improve the Hci (Intrinsic coercivity) of the ""Neo"". An example of the composition is given below.Typical composition of NdFeB alloyMain Elements within NdFeBPercentage by weightNeodymium (Nd) 29% - 32%Iron (Fe) 64.2% – 68.5%Boron (B) 1.0% - 1.2%Aluminium (Al) 0.2% - 0.4%Niobium (Nb) 0.5% -1%Dysprosium (Dy) 0.8% -1.2%The method of manufacture of Neodymium Iron Boron magnets is as follows:-The Neodymium metal element is initially separated from refined Rare Earth oxides in an electrolytic furnace. The ""Rare Earth"" elements are lanthanoids (also called lanthanides) and the term arises from the uncommon oxide minerals used to isolate the elements. Although the term ""Rare Earth"" is used, it does not mean that the chemical elements are scarce. The Rare Earth elements are abundant e.g. Neodymium element is more common than gold. The Neodymium, Iron and Boron are measured out and put in a vacuum induction furnace to form an alloy. Other elements are also added, as required for specific grades e.g. Cobalt, Copper, Gadolinium and Dysprosium (e.g. to assist with corrosion resistance). The mixture is melted due to the high frequency heating and melting the mixture.In simplified terms, the ""Neo"" alloy is like a cake mixture with each factory having its own recipe for each grade. The resultant melted alloy is then cooled to form ingots of alloy. The alloy ingots are then broken down by hydrogen decrepitation (HD) or hydrogenation disproportionation desorption and recombination (HDDR) and jet milled down in a nitrogen and argon atmosphere to a micron sized powder (about 3 microns or less in size). This Neodymium powder is then fed into a hopper to allow the pressing of magnets to occur.There are three main methods of pressing the powder – axial and transverse pressing. Die pressing requires tooling to make a cavity that is slightly larger than the required shape (because sintering causes shrinkage of the magnet). The Neodymium powder enters the die cavity from the hopper and is then compacted in the presence of an externally applied magnetic field. The external field is either applied parallel to the compacting force (this axial pressing is not so common) or perpendicular to the direction of compaction (this is called transverse pressing). Transverse pressing gives higher magnetic properties for the NdFeB.A third method of pressing is isostatic pressing. The NdFeB powder is put into a rubber mould and is put into a large fluid filled container which then has the pressure of the fluid increased. Again an external magnetizing field is present but the NdFeB powder is compacted from all sides. Isostatic pressing gives the best possible magnetic performance for Neodymium Iron Boron. The methods employed vary depending on the grade of ""Neo"" required and are decided by the manufacturer.The external magnetizing field is created by a solenoid coil set either side of the compacting powder. The magnetic domains of the NdFeB powder align with the magnetising field that is applied – the more homogenous the applied field, the more homogenous the magnetic performance of the Neodymium magnet. As the Neodymium powder is pressed by the die, the direction of magnetisation is locked in place – the Neodymium magnet has been given a preferred direction of magnetisation and is called anisotropic (if no external field were applied it would be possible to magnetise the magnet in any direction, which is called isotropic, but the magnetic performance would be much lower than that of an anisotropic magnet and is usually confined to bonded magnets).Rare Earth magnets exhibit uniaxial magnetocrystalline anisotropy i.e. they have a unique axis crystal structure corresponding with the easy axis of magnetisation. In the case of Nd2Fe14B, the easy axis of magnetisation is the c-axis of the complex tetragonal structure. In the presence of an external magnetizing field, it aligns along the c-axis, becoming capable of being fully magnetised to saturation with a very high coercivity.Before the pressed NdFeB magnet is released it is given a demagnetizing pulse to leave it unmagnetised. The compacted magnet is termed a 'green' magnet – it is easy to force to crumble apart and its magnetic performance is not good. The ‘green’ Neodymium magnet is then sintered to give it its final magnetic properties. The sintering process is carefully monitored (a strict temperature and time profile has to be applied) and occurs in an inert (oxygen free) atmosphere (e.g. argon). If oxygen is present, the resultant oxides destroy the magnetic performance of the NdFeB. The sintering process also causes shrinkage of the magnet as the powder fuses together. The shrinkage gives a magnet close to the required shape but the shrinkage is usually uneven (e.g. a ring may shrink to become an oval). At the end of the sintering process a final rapid quench is applied to rapidly cool the magnet. This is to minimize the unwanted production of ‘phases’ (in simplified terms, variants of the alloy with poor magnetic properties) that occurs at temperatures below the sintering temperature. A rapid quench maximizes the magnetic performance of NdFeB. Because the sintering process causes an uneven shrinkage, the shape of the Neodymium magnet will not be to the required dimensions.The next stage is to machine the magnets to the required tolerances. Because machining is required, the Neodymium magnets are made slightly larger when being pressed e.g. larger outer diameter, smaller inner diameter and taller for a ring magnet. Standard magnet dimensional tolerances are +/-0.1mm although +/-0.05mm is achievable at extra cost. The possibility of even tighter tolerances depends on the shape and size of the magnet and may not be achievable. For note, the Neodymium magnet is very hard. Trying to cut holes in NdFeB with a standard drill or carbide tip will blunt the drill bit. Diamond cutting tools (CNC diamond grinding wheels, diamond drills, etc) and wire cutting machines (EDM) have to be used. The NdFeB swarf powder produced during machining needs to be cooled by liquid otherwise it may spontaneously combust. For Neodymium block magnets, there may be cost savings in using much larger magnet blocks made by isostatic pressing and cutting them into smaller Neodymium blocks of the desired size. This is done for speed and for mass production (where enough cutting and grinding machines are present) and is known as ""slice and dice"". Once the final dimensions for the magnet has been met by machining, the Neodymium magnet is given a protective coating. This is usually a Ni-Cu-Ni coating.The magnet must be cleaned to remove any swarf/powder from machining. It is then dried thoroughly before being plated. It is imperative that the drying is thorough otherwise water is locked into the plated Neodymium magnet and the magnet will corrode from the inside out. The plating is very thin e.g. 15-35 microns for Ni-Cu-Ni (1 micron is 1/1000mm). The current range of coatings available are as follows:- Nickel-Copper-Nickel (Ni-Cu-Ni) [standard], Epoxy, Zinc (Zn), Gold (Au), Silver (Ag), Tin (Sn), Titanium (Ti), Titanium Nitride (TiN), Parylene C, Everlube, Chrome, PTFE (""Teflon""; white, black, grey, silvery) , Ni-Cu-Ni plus Epoxy, Ni-Cu-Ni plus Rubber, Zn plus Rubber, Ni-Cu-Ni plus Parylene C, Ni-Cu-Ni plus PTFE, Tin (Sn) plus Parylene C, Zinc Chromate, Phosphate Passivation and Uncoated (i.e. bare – not recommended but is sometimes required by the customer). Other coatings may be possible. It is not recommended to use the magnet without a protective layer.Higher Hci Neodymium magnets are said to be better at corrosion resistance but this does not guarantee safe use when unplated. If necessary plate the magnets after assembly (this is because any glue would adhere to the plating rather than the NdFeB magnet and so if the plating fails, the magnet becomes free). Removing the plating to allow better glue adhesion is possible but corrosion resistance in the Neodymium magnet may be severely compromised during such a process unless great care is taken during assembly (protective sleeves may be worth considering to ensure the magnets stay in place e.g. carbon fibre sleeve for rotors).15-30 microns Ni-Cu-Ni Standard coating requiredEpoxy resins are not hermeticThickness buildup can be a problemOnce plated the Neodymium magnet is then magnetized. The Neodymium magnet is placed in a solenoid coil which is energized to produce a field at least 3 times the value of the magnet’s Hci. It is not unusual for Rare Earth magnets to be 'hit' with a field of 5T. The Rare Earth magnets sometimes have to be physically held in place within the coil otherwise the magnet may react to the applied magnetizing pulse and is propelled out of the coil (a bit like a bullet). The Neodymium magnet, being an isotropic, has a direction of magnetization locked within its structure. When being magnetized, this direction of magnetization within the structure aligns with the magnetizing field. If the magnet is not aligned with the magnetizing field, the magnet will violently spin to align up. It is possible for the magnet to break up / shatter due to the high rotational forces acting on the domains within the magnet. The magnet must be magnetized to saturation to get the maximum performance output. If the magnet is not aligned with the magnetizing field, full saturation of Neodymium may not be achieved."

720,"NOTE: This answer is not written to specifically explain why interest is haram in Islam. It may or may not have any links to the real reasons. I am also not an Islamic scholar. This is a long answer, but if you are interested in understanding how money works, keep reading.Have you ever thought about the fact why every country on Earth, including US, the country with the highest GDP, all are in debt? not just a small amount, but trillions of dollars of debt? Have you wondered who do we owe so much debt to? Read along and you will understand why.Let us for a sake of understanding forget all the queries you have mentioned about the benefits of interest and take an example of an extremely simplified scenario which when extended you will realize why interest is the root cause of all the evil in the world. I am going to use this example to simplify the relation between interest and inflation.Assume a hypothetical scenario, John and Bob, the only two guys living in a small, economically independent village. John needs money to start a business or for whatever reason, doesn't matter, say $100 (For example purposes $ is just a reference for money and not an actual US dollar). He doesn't have it, so he asks Bob to lend it to him. Bob has exactly $100 and so he agrees to lend it, provided John pays back with 10% interest. John agrees. John takes the $100, uses it. He has to pay back $100 + $10 as interest. The problem is, there are only $100 available in the village, how is he going to get that extra $10? This small village is now in $10 of debt. Bob will have to find a way to resolve it, else the economy will collapse.Enter Inflation. What Bob does is, that he print another $100. Since new money has been created out of nowhere, without any backing, this currency has now become Fiat. Now Bob wants, that John again borrows this money from him, for this reason, he lowers the interest rate from 10% to 1%. This is the reason why interest rates are low, during high inflation.John now sees a lucrative deal to borrow another $100 for such a low interest rate, and also pay off his previous debt. Great idea right? WRONG! He borrows the newly printed $100, and pays back his previous loan of $110.Lets summarize this scenario.Total money in Economy: $200Money remaining with John: $90Money already returned to Bob by John: $110Money still left to be paid back by John to Bob: $100 (from the new loan) + $1 (interest) = $101This means that if John again wants to pay back his loan, he will now be $101–$90= $11 in debt instead of the previous $10. So with the new printing of money, the economy went further into debt, from $10 to $11. There is no way John can ever repay this loan because the extra $11 does not exist in the economy and this cycle keeps continuing.At this point, Bob really does not care that his $11 cannot be repaid by John ever, because now John is essentially his slave. John doesn't know it yet, and will never know, that's the beauty of Modern Slavery.Bob will also provide a host of other options to John to make him feel he is trying to help, like giving him new credit/credit card to pay off his previous debt, or EMI, or cashbacks, or some stupid gift or bonuses, or credit rating.Scale it up, and this is exactly how the real world operates, but to make sure that a huge majority of the people do not understand this scam, the system is made much more complex with bonds and federal reserve or reserve bank, and all those hocus pocus terms you hear but hardly understand, by our own democratically elected govt and the lobbyists. Replace John with the Govt that wants the money to avoid the collapse of economy, Bob is the Federal Reserve or the Bank that prints money. Similarly, John can also be replaced by common citizens, businesses, banks that borrow money from other banks, or basically anyone that borrows money on interest. Bob on the other ha..."
721,"Well, the quality of questions has really gone down. I myself have downvoted and reported many questions in the last two weeks. There are many insincere questions, questions very poorly formed, questions that don't look like they really are looking for serious answers. One of the most annoying is the kind of question which can be found out in one click on the Internet and is not a matter of opinion, and more annoying is the repeated question. Why don't people take just a few seconds to type in the question in the Quora search box and find out whether it has been adequately answered or not? Is it asking too much?Today I read an answer for “What are some of the most merged questions in Quora?”. One top answer was, “Who would win between a lion and a tiger?”. You should check out the number of variations of the same question and some very adequate answers right now. Only about half an hour later, a question popped up in my feed asking, “Who would win a fight between a lion and a tiger?”. I tell you it is very very irritating and annoying and shows some insincerity on the part of the OP.So,I am also all for not only Quora recommending edits and removing questions as well as answers, but also all other members not ignoring such instances like badly phrased or insincere questions, and downvoting and reporting them."
722,"First, allow me to say that no anon speaks for any other, nor the hive. i speak for my own anon-self, a decade in the making. That said…Your question is akin to asking to “join” the internet. You don’t sign up per say, you simply facilitate a connection and there it is, the interwebz in all its glory and horror and informations. There is no specific group anonymous, hackers or otherwise to join. Anonymous is an idea, a way of life if you will, that seeks to free humanity from the followers of greed. I have heard a saying that I think explains this rather well,“Being anonymous is like being in love. No one can tell you if you are or you’re not, you just know.”Keeping the above in mind always, there are resources out there though that might help you to find others of like minds and interests to play with. OpNewBlood for example, might be one place to start.If you want to become a hacker, the best thing you can do is to learn the basics, hone your skills and possess a sound understanding of the art. You will find those hackers who might be well known or infamous for being GOOD at what they do, all share one thing in common, see rules #1 and #2 of the rules of the internet.Important note for those seeking to learn about anonymous:Be very aware that there are those out there… channels and sites which call themselves anonymous, but their only goal is profit. It should be known that there exists no official channel, ‘HQ’, profile or site which represents anonymous. Any such claim or title should render said entity suspect immediately, as most certainly they use the anonymous namesake for their own personal gain through click bait and other nefarious tactics.

Anonymous just wants you to think.Thanks to Gina Floyd for requesting I answer this question. I hope my answer is helpful."
723,"The VVitchI saw ""The VVitch'' back in early March and I thought it was decent, but I didn't understand what all the fuss was all about. Yeah, it looked nice and it had a chilling atmosphere but that's the only thing I got from it. Well, to be fair, I think I was the only one that I liked this movie compared to my friends and family, as they thought the movie was terrible. I liked the movie but I thought it was kind of slow, I was a bit confused at times and the movie didn't stick with me after it was done. If I was reviewing this back in March, I would probably give this movie a 3/5.But after re-watching the film, I actually liked it even more and there was a lot of things that I can't believe I missed on my first viewing. I don't know how to explain it, but I had this uncomfortable feeling from watching this that I never experience the first time. This is a horror movie that exceeds in film making, it's freaky score and it's gloomy atmosphere that really made this film a true horror.This is a great psychological horror film that can really get under the your skin. I started to notice little details that really made this movie freaking scary when you understand the meaning of it. This doesn't have any stupid jump scars that deflates tension or just any horror movie tropes that we've seen million times already, but that's nowhere to be seen in the ''The VVitch''.THANK GOODNESS!Oh and the cinematography is this movie is just flawless. I'm starting to notice a trend in indie horror movies today - With the shots being perfectly set up and the very little use of light that really adds to the atmosphere to this film.Thank you Robert Eggers for your brilliant direction and this movie."
724,"My brother and I went to the same school.When I was in grade 3, my brother and I got into an argument at home. I had stolen his pancakes and in retaliation, he landed a flurry of punches on my face.I was itching for revenge. My brother was in grade 6.At school, I gathered a few of my friends and told them what happened at home. We decided to square my brother off.During the break, roughly about ten of my friends and I marched toward my brother’s classroom. We were not scared of his seniority. We were armed with deadly weapons such as rulers, lunch bags, water bottles etc.When we reached his classroom, one of his friends informed him of my siege. He walked out curiously.“What the hell are you doing, Ben?” he asked, looking surprisingly at the phalanx of soldiers watching my back.“WHY DID YOU PUNCH ME?” I asked(read squealed) aggressively.“Wha—?” he couldn’t believe I was doing that.“Okay…okay..I am sorry. I am sorry….Go back to your classroom. The break is going to be over.”He looked around him frequently. He clearly did not want to be embarrassed.Flexing my muscles, I had a fervent discussion with my soldiers and we, as a team, decided to let him go.“This is a warning for you,” I warned my brother and walked back to my classroom, flanked by my Commanders.Rumor has it that my brother and his friends were found rolling on the floor and laughing hard as we marched back.Many years went by.It was my mom’s farewell. My family was there.When she was asked to speak, she spoke of a lot of things. She narrated what happened between me and my brother years ago.Then, she said this: “I am proud of a lot of things I have done, but what I am most proud of is how I raised my children.”“The aggression I saw in Ben at such a young age troubled me as a mother.”“But I did not tell him that aggression was bad. I just showed him the right way to use aggression and violence. I am sure he would wrestle a lion if that is what it takes to protect his brothers.”The crowd burst into a loud applause.With the dying applause, she looked into the rows of teachers and said assertively: “Do not tell your children that aggression is bad. That violence is bad. Tell them where to use those.”“As much as I have told them the importance of kindness, I have taught them to protect the ones they love.”“You need aggression. You need violence. You should know how to land a good punch. Just know where and when to use those”As she got down from the dais magnificently folding her Saree, I looked at her with awe and chaos.Mom is hard to understand. She speaks of love, compassion, and kindness.But all of a sudden, she would speak of smacking people if that is what takes to protect loved ones.She is inconsistent. She is flawed. She is selfish. She is human.Maybe she has her reasons. Through the maps of wrinkles I see on her face, maybe there are obscure stories I would not understand.But—In the midst of all her imperfections, hypocrisies, and mistakes, love sustains.I find this flaw to be beautiful. This human part of her. This selfish morsel of her is beautiful.Flaws are beautiful."
725,"What is a good life?To me, a good life is living where you are able to wake up everyday in anticipation and excitement for what's to come. Material success and artificial sensations wouldn't mean a thing. Compassion, love, and generosity would be the aim.A good life is one where you aim to make a positive mark on the world you live in.With that considered, I would say the following things are necessary to maintain a good life:Self-sufficiency: How else can you live a good life when you are stuck under the grace of others? Wouldn't that cause anxiety and frustration? Manage yourself. It has to be necessary.Desire to learn new things: A good life is one filled with the constant gain of knowledge. You have to desire to learn more and grow otherwise you're missing the point.Strong focus on your passions: You can use your passion in your own way. Concentrate on it. It's what can give you a life purpose - which is very important.Travel: People say that travel isn't for everyone, but I personally believe it's essential. It's one of the few ways you can meet people who are just like you and very different from you at the same time. You have a big world below your feet. Take advantage of it!It all sounds idealistic, but you make your own life."
726,"To those who haven't traveled in an non air-conditioned railway coach (generally referred to as a sleeper coach) in India, I apologize for my choice of metaphor here. To give a bit of a background, more than half the reserved coaches in India are non-AC. They are generally messier, filthier, hotter, more crowded, and generally more of an unpleasant experience than their air conditioned counterparts.Imagine such a journey. You board the train at 8 AM in the morning, settle down, and feel yourself being slowly engulfed with excitement and hopeful anticipation. It is going to be a long trip; 24 hours to be precise. But the prospect of going back to your hometown, or seeing your lover after a long time, or starting a new chapter in a strange city, or any of the multitude of reasons you undertook this voyage, would certainly make up for it. Its almost noon. Things have been smooth for the past 4 hours. The weather's fine, but it is definitely getting hotter. Your coach is only ~50% occupied. You have already finished the book you had purchased earlier, at the onset of the journey. To be fair, it was a disappointment. However, it did help you kill a few hours. But you are no longer in the mood to read more, so you do not take out the second one, letting it sit idly in your backpack, hopefully to be picked up during the return leg.The first big station arrives. A great human wave overwhelms your compartment. In a few minutes, when the commotion subsides, and the train resumes nonchalantly, you realize that there are now more people than seats. A lot of people without the proper reservations have also got in. But being in India, there is nothing much you can do about it. An elderly gentleman comes up to you and asks you to shift a bit to accommodate him. You are well within your rights to refuse, but you don't want to sound rude. So you comply; you adjust. Another 3 hours pass by. The heat has become unbearable. You curse our little, ordinary, yellow star. You notice that another young man has somehow sneaked into your seat. Originally meant to seat 3, it now is carrying 5. There isn't enough room for you to get comfortable. Not fair, you think. After all you planned your travel in advance and paid for the seat. So you take a stand, and politely ask the gentleman to leave. It's 6 PM now. The sun has started to go down. You have become accustomed to the crowd, the crying children, the noisy group of teenagers in the next compartment, and everything else. The guy you had asked to leave earlier comes back, walks up to you, and apologizes. He is a student, who had to suddenly leave for home due to a personal emergency. He says his stop is next. And that he is terribly sorry for the inconvenience he caused you. You feel like an ass. You realize you had been a terrible person. You blurt out your apology too, hoping to make up for your earlier blunder. You offer him half you seat until his journey ends. You start talking. He is a good kid. 30 minutes or so fly by in what felt like a jiffy. You bid adieu but not without adding him on Facebook. You just made a friend. 7 PM and you are gazing our of the window. The cool counter-breeze is a welcome relief after the sun's unsolicited display of strength earlier that day. The scenery is wonderful too. Lush green fields, small lakes and ponds, a tiny creek, a rustic little settlement. You can almost feel the languid rural life calling out to you, a stark contrast against the hectic pace of the city. Is that regret you are feeling?Anyway, back to the present. Some of the scenery is so beautiful, you wish you could stop and admire it for a few moments more. But like Frost's reminiscence of a fateful winter evening passing through the woods, or Wordsworth's vivid memoirs of gazing upon a daffodil field, you know it isn't possible. Everything comes, stays for a while, and then leaves. Nothing is permanent. With that thought, both distressing and comforting, you eat your dinner and go to sleep. You wake up at 6 AM the next morning, mostly infuriated by the commotion in the coach. To your pleasant surprise, you find a cute girl sitting across from your seat. Being shy, you simply take out the second book and start reading. A few minutes later, the lady interrupts you inquiring about the said book. Not a bad investment, you think. One thing leads to another, and you soon find yourself in the midst of a wonderful conversation. You are pleasantly surprised to discover that the two of you work in the same city, belong to the same town, and have overlapping interests in most cases. ""Could this be love?"", you heart asks. ""Let's not get ahead of ourselves."", your brain replies. However, it definitely could be the beginning of something wonderful. You exchange numbers and outline some vague plans to catch up soon.The journey is coming to an end. You feel both relieved and a bit nostalgic. You are where you wanted to be, but in the process you will have to let go of the past 24 hours. That is life. A journey. A series of events, some memorable some not. An emotional roller-coaster of joy, sadness, excitement, disappointment. A constant battle between being a little sympathetic and understanding vs standing your ground. Friendship. Love. An elapsing sequence of scenes, of moments, of memories. All of them fleeting. Permanently. Irrevocably. The final destination for all is the same - irrespective of power, wealth, beauty, ambition. Death is the eventual finality that we all need to embrace and accept. However, it's the ephemeral nanosecond in the cosmic calendar, where you exist, that is all that matters. "
727,So there was this event call Comic Fiesta (CF). They have this event every end of the year. This even is those anime cosplaying stuff and I really wanted to go. At first I was so excited but I had no one to go with me. so I invited my friends if they can go with me and we can have fun. they said they are all not going. so I decide to not go as well. I didnt buy the ticket. and one that 2 days event all of them (those who said they were not going) went to the event. they even took pictures. I felt betrayed.. what should I do..
728,"Want To Gain Weight? Here’s The Right FoodSea food Salmon, tuna and shrimps are the healthy way to gain weight. Consume 2 portions of salmon every day. Salmon is protein rich, and increases weight too. Shrimps are packed with necessary fatty acid content, which fill your body with healthy calories. Tuna consists of vital fatty acid which contains healthy fats. This is good for gaining weight and maintaining a good physique.Milk Products Dairy products like full fat milk, cheese and butter are a good way to gain nutrients and weight. Butter means healthy weight for life. Moderate intake is suggested for a healthy heart. Cheese like cheddar is packed with 69 calories and is also rich in calcium, protein, fat, calories and cholesterol. Whole milk or full fat milk consists of 60 good calories which leads to weight gain, and provides essential nutrients too.Bread and Bagel Most of us like bread and bagel. So, this can be a yummy and healthy way to gain weight. Bagels are good source of carbs and are extra calorie dense. Eating whole wheat bread is also a good idea. You can team it with whole egg, which is also a good source of protein, good cholesterol and vitamin A, D and E. Corn bread is also a good option, as it is also loaded with carbs and approximately 328 calories.Dry Fruits, Nuts and Seeds A good source of good calories and energy, nuts and seeds help in increasing weight. So munch on dry fruits, trails instead of fresh fruits. Consuming dry fruits helps you in gaining calories quickly, apart from providing adequate nutrients. While seeds and nuts consist of healthy calories, polyunsaturated fats are the one that help in. So add almonds, walnuts and pumpkin seeds in your daily diet. You can also have granola bar, packed with 500 calories it is loaded with nuts and seeds.Peanut Butter The yummy salty and soft spread on bread is the best to have in breakfast. Peanut butter consists of approx 192 calories and proteins, and is one of the best to increase weight. Eat calorie dense food to gain weight with proper nutrients. So have a peanut and whole wheat bread toast with whole egg in tomorrow’s breakfast.Fruits and Juices Fruit juice is packed with calories and is a good energy booster too. But remember always consume 100 percent fruit juice packed with sugar and nutrients. You can also go for a fruit like banana, packed with 100 calories, it is rich in nutrients and carbs too. So if you want to gain weight, banana and a glass of whole fruit juice are a must on your breakfast menu."
729,"Why is salt water taffy candy imported in the United Kingdom?Is it? Never seen it anywhere. I only know the term from old Scooby Doo episodes.We don't have the word “Taffy” here, so if anyone wants taffy (rather than toffee or fudge), they would need to make it or import it.I asked an American living here what it was and I seem to remember she said it was softer than toffee, but not the same as fudge. If so, it might be different enough to import some, but probably not different enough to displace those two very popular types of traditional sweets*. If there aren't many people who want it, its unlikely to be economic to make it here. Especially if part of its appeal is in being a traditional american sweet.*I like bonfire toffee the best. You could definitely break a tooth on it though!"
730,"Thanks for your request to answer: Is there a different price over the Internet than in person when trying to book a room in Mexico City from the US?Nowadays there are different prices, for the same thing, every moment, everytime, all the time.Generally speaking in the hospitality business, if you book in advance…and, booking online generally implies “in advance”, you will get much better rates than walking into an hotel a making a booking (unless they know you or you are some sort of especial client). The walk-in rates are usually called the “rack rates” for a hotel and are commonly the highest for that particular type of hotel and for each particular type of room the have/offer.Now, there is an art and science called “Targeted pricing” in which prices of a certain item can vary A LOT depending on many many many different circumstances and parameters: You could get into a site, check the price of whatever you want, then come back 3 (three, just to say a number) minutes later and the price could be different. Or, you could check the price from Mexico and get a number and check it at the same time from the US and be a totally different number. Or, if you check it in the morning may be different if you check it on night time… And, you, as the customer may not perceive this changes to be consistent to ANYTHING… this is because there are thounsands of parameters being evaluated by the computers of your vendor and presenting the most convenient pricing to the potential customers as to maximize revenue to that business.That is why, when for instance you book an airplane seat and maybe you could have paid USD$100 (again as an example number) and the person sitting next to you could have paid $5,000 for pretty much the same seat as you, on the same day, same route and in theory the same class of service.There are no written rules about pricing. Call the hotel and ask for their price, if you like it book it, but not before being maybe at the very same time online and checking the prices not only at the very same hotel’s web site..but also at some other web sites specialized in that hotels subjet, to name a few:Booking.com: The largest selection of hotels, homes, and vacation rentalsHotels.com - Earn Free Nights on Cheap Hotels Near YouVacations, Cheap Flights, Airline Tickets & AirfaresVacations, Cheap Flights, Airline Tickets & Airfaresand many more …(Yes, I noticed two of the above links print the same line, one I wrote is EXPEDIA and the other is ORBITZ…which now are the same company, but different web sites)Good luck, safe and fun travels !"

Wherever there is Love, there is also Wealth and Success !!"""
734,"I wanted to answer this question since long but didn’t get any time.The legionAfter a couple of high-profile hacks, which even saw Rahul Gandhi losing access to his Twitter account and emails of many prominent people including journalist Barkha Dutt dumped out in the open, everyone is asking who is Legion. The hackers -- or is it just a lone wolf -- who have hacked Rahul Gandhi, Barkha Dutt, Vijay Mallya and now are going after Lalit Modi, claim that their group is called Legion. They have become active on Twitter and are supposedly threatening everyone in India who they believe is corrupt.""Okay Brothers we're back. #legion. Support our cause to expose the rats in our system,"" the Legion recently tweeted. The ""group"" also exhorts that people should expose the corrupt persons by leaking their details to Legion through an email id. The mail is hosted on SIGAINT, a fairly secure email service available to public.So who exactly are the guys -- or girls -- behind Legion and how they are hacking into the accounts of prominent people in India? The answer to first question is that we don't know. And it is fairly certain that anyone, other than probably a handful of people, really know at the moment. As for how they are doing it, the answer is again we don't know for sure.

735,"Should Education system be changed? yesHow?Answer:Remove English education completely: English was introduced by the British Raj, as a way to degrade our patriotism towards our own country, but after the damage caused by Mughal and British invasion, our Prakrit and Sanskrit education system was dumped, and even after 1947 independence we had no choice but to introduce English as ‘Link language’ as Indian states are divided by languages. English is a foreign language, it does not share or care about the Indian culture, you cannot discriminate people respectively like “Tu, Tum, Ap” in Hindi, and other languages, english is completely different.Introduce a new national language, such as Sanskrit: Sanskrit and Prakrit was always used in Ancient India, Brahmins made the most progress. For Example: Aryabhatta did all his works in Sanskrit(this is a fact). Sanskrit included the entire Hindu culture in a language, Making Sanskrit compulsory in all classes and even higher classes will help the students in knowing the national more efficiently.Remove british history and Mughal history, and introduce the might of the Indian emperors, their strength and wealth: British did their best to make us feel bad about our history, hence they introduced what caused our rulers fail to protect our own country.Make moral science as a subject compulsory till Class 8: Although this is already being followed in many school this is essential too.Re-Develop the Class rooms and provide appropriate maintenance: One of the basic infrastructural needs, if the schools are already hygienic, then it will simply attract students, except of repelling them."
736,"Hollow columns are mostly used while constructing bridges. They are preferred to solid columns as they have less seismic mass, and thus make the superstructure comparatively safer.Also, this type of structural member may be, in some cases,economically viable when compared to usual solid members. Their applications include large bridge columns andpiles as well as offshore platforms. This structural type was in fact extensively used in Europe and in Japan sincethe early seventies. The economical convenience in the use of hollow columns is due to the cost saving affordedby reduced section area (up to 70%). Also, hollow columns are more efficient than solid ones from a structuralpoint of view. When the weight of the vertical members is relevant in the performance of the entire structure, asignificant reduction in the seismic mass may be attained by using this structural type."

738,"Every teen girl? Come on now.You’re referring to an entire age range of 13–19 and you think that every girl in this age range harbours a secret crush on their math teacher?While I don’t rule out the possibility that some of them definitely can have a crush on their math teacher, I also feel a substantially large number of them probably thinks Justin Bieber or Zayn Malik is way cooler than their math teacher ever will be.As for the second question, which only pertains to those who do have a crush on their math teacher, the answer is probably a yes (i.e. either their intelligence or their behavior) but I feel compelled to point that you have left out a third possibility: that the math teacher, among other things, is extremely good-looking.Or did you think only boys dig good looks?"
739,"No, if you can get in you probably have what it takes intellectually and, honestly, a few extra years of life experience probably helps as well with maturity, communicating with patients and colleagues, etc.The major issue with starting at an older age is the increased responsibilities that tend to come along with it (e.g., spouse, children, mortgage, etc.) and time and stress management. Med school is pretty intense and residency is more intense so that’s 7 to 11+ years (depending on specialty and if you do a fellowship) of heavy studying, long hours and low pay.It becomes your life. You have to love it.I started an MD/PhD program at 25 (finished at 32) and then did a 3 year postdoc (age 35) and then matched in neurosurgery (additional 7 years). I left residency to launch my oncology startup but otherwise I would have finished this year at age 42.In my med school class there were maybe 10% who didn’t come straight from undergrad and 1 who was in her 40s (single, no kids). There were also a handful of married students and they formed a support group along with their spouses. All of them are now practicing.I still think regardless of age the 3 most important things that determine success in med school/residency/practice are 1) location (don’t move to a city you hate or can’t afford, being close to family/friends helps too), 2) cost of tuition (I wouldn’t pay extra for ivy league or private school if you plan on being a private primary care doc), and 3) the people you surround yourself with (maintaining friendships/hobbies, supportive spouse, study groups, support groups, having positive clinical mentors).Good luck!"

Reason being the kind of work culture, people around you and yeah a year long training program which is indeed alot of fun. I joined NTPC in sep 2016. I had my technical training at ntpc simhadri for 3.5 months which was power plant familiarisation. The classes started at 10 am and continued till 1 pm. Then lunch break for two hours and then again a two hour session and then you can go to gym, play tennis, go for swimming and what not. People working in ntpc are really happy and satisfied with their lives and job. Right now I am in Noida undergoing management module for 2.5 months. I went for Outborne training in TEHRI for a week which was fantabulous we did tree climbing,valley crossing, trekking, rafting etc etc. I love this company to the core and would have spent my life here if it was not for a UPSC job :-P.After training we are posted to our locations where we are supposed to sit in an air conditioned control room and work from there. Only problem is that you have to work in shifts which changes in every two days. Two days morning shift(6–2) next two day afternoon(2–10) and post that night shift (10–6). Night shift being the most difficult,then you have a day off and then general shift where you do have to attend a meeting for an hour or so. So it is 6 days work and 2 days off (considering one hour general shift as off :P). You do have alot of holidays (30 earned leave, 12 casual leaves, 6 restricted holidays, 20 half paid leaves, 16 leaves for working on saturdays and plus 10 more leaves for the same purpose and is encashable). You have to work for 8 hours after that you are free to pursue your hobby. You do get a variable pay of around 1.2 lakhs per annum. You do get 60k for laptop, 40k for pc ,10 k for mobiles, briefcase allowance,spectacle allowance, free medical in hospitals like apollo and fortis, free accomodation in townships etc etc. If you enjoy city life more, then this company is not for you. As you will be posted in remotest location of the country where even flipkart delivery is not possible forget about malls, multiplex, dominos,pizza hut etc etc. But you can enjoy your life and your family can live a peaceful life.So why am i leaving ntpc?I was attracted towards GROUP A services in India since I was 6 yrs old (I am serious :P).

Wanted to join indian railways but will end up with indian ordnance factory services IOFS.Am i happy?Yes, I am very happy with IOFS there are several reasons for it listed below-It is not as hectic as indian railways where you always need to be on your toes. You can take leaves easily. Iofs is a (8–6) job with two hour lunch break :P.With more authorities comes more responsibilities. In railways you are heading more than 700 people at the very first posting and believe me handling people is very difficult. Handling machines is rather very easy. They won’t judge you,they wont talk behind your back. In IOFS I will be handling a staff of around 100–150 people which is good enough.I would be posted as an Assistant director in ministry of defence. Sounds good right :-P. I would have my own cabin with IES written below my name. I will have a stenographer for doing the typing stuffs.I will get military canteen facillities, will get a 2 BHK accomodation, will get all my bills reimbursed and a inhand salary of around 53–54k during training (15 months training :P) and around 62k after training though far le..."

747,"You're probably thinking of Carmina Burana by the composer Carl Orff, although the work is actually a vocal cantata, not an opera.  The most commonly used section from Carmina Burana that you'll hear in the movies is O Fortuna, although it's use is not limited to horror movies.  I'm not totally sure about this, but I strongly suspect that its use is much more common in horror movie trailers than in horror movies themselves.  This is because movie trailers are often made before the soundtrack of a film is completed.  The O Fortuna section from Carmina Burana is so ridiculously popular in movie trailers that it's practically a cliché by now, horror movie trailers included.  Here's a clip of what O Fortuna sounds like so you can check if it's what you're looking for: There's also a Wikipedia page Carl Orff's O Fortuna in popular culture that may also provide you with some more answers you are looking for.  According to the Wikipedia page, the earliest horror movie trailer anybody can find with Carl Orff's O Fortuna on it is for the 1990 Canadian B movie Cursed."
748,"There is no easy answer to this. It all depends on the parish and circumstances involved.I know of parishes where it is an open secret that the priest is in a relationship with someone (male or female) and the parish is quite happy with it because the priest is much loved. Most Catholics in Germany think the requirements for priestly celibacy should be dropped, and are thus understanding of priests having such relationships.There are also cases where a priest is married (because he was originally a non-Roman Catholic clergyman) and it often is seen as quite positive.Nonetheless the teachings of the Roman Catholic Church are clear and the hierarchy adamant. While some bishops are willing to turn a blind eye to such relationships, others very definitely are not, and some churchgoers are more than happy to blow the whistle. It can result in a painful crisis for all involved and it is not something anyone should take lightly. The end result is not necessarily ostracism per se — but it does mean the priest will eventually lose his vocation in the Roman Catholic Church. The partner may well face a lot of anger from others for his/her role in this as well. The shock of losing a priest in this way can tear a parish to pieces and cause immense grief.Nearly always the priest is forced to give up his license (technically he remains a priest but is banned from providing sacraments, typically getting a job if he is lucky in pastoral care) or they leave the Roman Catholic Church to become Anglican/Episcopal or Old Catholic. Most Old Catholic priests in Europe are former Roman Catholic priests, and there is a waiting list of Roman priests wanting to join, very often (but not always) with this very scenario as the primary reason.So such a relationship will probably not result in outright ostracism, but it won’t be a walk in the park, either. It almost certainly ends with the priest’s career in ruins and a lot of angry, hurt, disappointed people around the two of them. All the more reason I think the policy should change, if I may say so, but until it does this sort of thing will continue."

751,"Bala Senthil Kumar’s comment is really the answer you’re looking for:“Because of a lack of high traction properties. The superhero movies are also fantasies and we have enough of them I think.”LOTR and Hobbit both had an existing, large fan base and so the movie studio was willing to risk the big budgets that the movies required to really be done well. And it turns out, it was money well spent.Marvel (now Disney), Warner Brothers and Fox studios are also tapping into existing fan bases as they make their comic book movies. Again, they’re hoping that the money spent to make these movies will be worth the risk.Terry Brooks’ Shannara series is a popular fantasy series, but not with the same kind of following as LOTR. Too much of a risk to be turned into a major set of movies, so instead a TV series has been made and is being shown on MTV, “The Shannara Chronicles.”Thing is, LOTR and The Hobbit set an extremely high standard for these types of movies. It took a lot of money, and an excellent director, to get those movies made. No one is going to risk that much money on lesser known stories."

There many competitive coders from Tamil Nadu.
753,"Disappointment.From arriving at Port Said we were constantly pestered by people trying to sell cheap replicas of the pyramids and other cheap rubbish.After a long journey down to Cairo, getting off the coach we gave our packed lunch to a very hungry looking boy in the street who was delighted, that is until some older boys came along and beat the living daylights out of him for accepting it.Passing the locals in the early hours of the morning, some washing themselves in waste water collecting in the gutters you are reminded that despite a modern facade, you are in what is still essentially a third world country.I’ve always had a romantic view of the Pyramids of Giza, but it was spoiled slightly as we drove along “Giza Road” , briefly passing the “Giza Supermarket” and the “Giza Laundrette” until finally arriving at the Giza Pyramids themselves.More jostling by street vendors vying for business and then onto the choice of transport to make the final stretch to the top of the plateau- horse and carriage or camel.So we opted for camel, and sitting on a threadbare saddle and feeling slightly foolish about the whole thing we were treated to a brief bout of blackmail by the camel drivers who were banging the camels together with the tourists sitting on top until they gave up and paid a handsome tip just to be allowed to get off.Then, the first sight of the pyramids and the crushing realization that, far from the usual romantic desert scenes in the brochures you suddenly realise that the Egyptian Tourist Board have made a great job of making it look romantic and remote when the actual truth is that the scene resembles something more like a bunch of ruins which have been placed on top of a hill to hide the crappy view of decaying buildings, industrial units and shops which look more like this :-Then onto the Cairo Museum, and a lovely encounter with a very enthusiastic Tourist Police Officer who was quite happy to give directions to the museum…but wanted a tip first, standing there with a huge smile and his upturned thumb and forefinger rubbing together in the unmistakeable international gesture which means “Give me money”Then the museum itself- home to some of the greatest treasures and antiquities in the world- the sarcophagi- the statues- the Golden Mask of Tutankhamen… and the horrible dry rot creeping through the wooden cabinets and the plumbing leaks in the ceiling leaving dark stained watermarks dangerously close to the exhibits , which makes you realise that perhaps these priceless objects are not being cared for as well as they should be.Having said that, this was back in 1992 and I have heard that things have improved a little since!"
754,"JavaScriptNot to be confused with Java, JavaScript is primarily a client-side scripting language used for front-end development. JavaScript is compatible across all browsers and is used to create interactive web apps, often through libraries such as jQuery and front-end frameworks such as AngularJS, Ember.js, React, and more.JavaScript can also be used as a server-side language through the Node.js platform. Two years ago, Node.js was still quite young, but its community has grown a lot since then, and you can now find many resources here. You can also build hybrid mobile apps with JavaScript through using frameworks such as phonegap, while Facebook’s React Native allows you to build native mobile apps with JavaScript.However, JavaScript is also known as a difficult language because it is untyped and, thus, difficult to debug. There are statically typed versions, such as Microsoft's TypeScript or the JSX, that React uses.RubyRuby was developed so developers can have fun and be productive at the same time. Ruby was made popular by the Ruby on Rails framework, a full-stack web framework optimized for programming happiness. As Ruby reads like English and Rails has tools that make common development tasks easier “out-of-the-box”, many would recommend learning Ruby as your first programming language.Ruby is mostly used for back-end development, and popular sites such as Airbnb, Shopify, Bloomberg, Hulu, Slideshare, and more, were all built with Ruby on Rails.PythonPython is another highly recommended language for beginners, and is the most popular introductory language at Top U.S. Universities.Developers have used Python to build desktop apps and web apps alike, and it has great tools for data mining. In addition, Python is particularly popular in academic communities for scientific computing, data analysis, and bioinformatics.Google, Dropbox, Pinterest, Instagram, Reddit, BitTorrent, Civilization IV, and more, were built with Python.PHPPHP is a server-side scripting language and is usually considered beginner-friendly. It’s easy to conceptualize what the PHP code will do, which makes it easy to pick up. Most websites have been built with PHP because the language is heavily specialized for the web.Facebook, Wikipedia, Yahoo!, Tumblr, Wordpress, and more, were built with PHP.Statically Typed LanguagesApps built with statically typed languages are known to be more scalable, stable, and maintainable. Static languages are usually more strict in catching errors through type checking, and it takes more code to build a prototype. Game engines, mobile apps, and enterprise-level back-ends are usually built with statically typed languages.JavaAs a general-purpose language, Java is used to build Android apps, desktop apps, and games. Java is also commonly used as a server-side language for enterprise-level back-end development - 90 percent of Fortune 500 companies use Java.Furthermore, Hadoop is a popular Java-based framework used for storing and processing big data, and is implemented by enterprises such as Yahoo, Facebook, and Amazon Web Services.CC is often used to program system software and is the lingua franca of Operating Systems.C has influenced almost every programming language we’ll be examining in this article, especially Objective-C and C++. So, if you know C well, it'd probably be easier for you to pick up other popular languages. Since C takes more complex code to perform simple tasks, beginners may find it tough to stay motivated if this is their first language. However, knowledge of C will definitely help you as a programmer in the long run.Objective-C / Swift (for iOS development)Objective-C is a layer built on top of the C language, which makes it static. With that said, it can also be used for dynamic typing. Apple’s Swift is a static language designed to be compatible with Objective-C, but its static-typing makes it more ..."

758,"London house prices are crazy:And disconnected from what people earn:Fortunately they have now started to pause:However I hope you are not a renter because rents are going up:Supply and demand is key - population and households are growing faster than the housing stock:They are being pulled in by jobs:But the main thing is that we are not building enough houses:My two cents are that house prices will stabilise around here until 2020 while rents go up by >50% (that's 15%^3 if you're wondering).Buy to let is about 13% of mortgages in any given year and c5% of the housing stock. The government has proposed a tapering of the interest deduction for buy to let borrowing and a 3% stamp duty surcharge on second properties.It seems likely that these changes will make buy to let unprofitable, and force significant rent rises. If that fails to generate the required returns, then landlords will sell up. This ""supply"" may keep prices in check. You can read a bit more about this here:The last few days I've been boring people with buy to let tax proposals.…In answer to some of the risks to house prices I would respond as follows.Economic recession - we already had a terrible one in 2007/08, check the chart at the top it barely left a dent.Higher interest rates - this is plausible, and there are levels which would drag back the market. However there is not the inflation or economic animal spirits to justify high interest rates. We are well aware of the deflation in global tradeable goods. And the rest of it is linked to wages...where rises would be bullish.Less foreign buyers - this has begun and is partly what is being targeted by the government. But let go of thinking foreign buyers are driving the market, they are concentrated at the high end and have a small impact relative to the lack of supply.London losing its cachet - I think this has already started.

760,"If you’re considering learning a new language (or refreshing an old one) as I am for my New Year's resolution this year, you should check out Duolingo, the free app/site used by over 110 million people and winner of Apple, Google and TechCrunch awards. You can choose from over 15 languages including Spanish, French, Portuguese, Italian, German, Turkish, and Russian. It’s available on the web (www.duolingo.com), Android, iOS, and Windows Phone.DISCLAIMER: I had such a good experience with Duolingo that I recently applied to work there (and somehow convinced them to take me!).Here’s why I think Duolingo helped me stick with my New Year’s resolution:Its bite-sized lessons prevent burnout. You can use the app anywhere and anytime,and I’ve snuck in many sessions while waiting in lines or during down time (though I also stumbled upon two effective learning times: during my morning commute to work and right before I go to bed).It is designed to feel like a game to keep you motivated. As you get better, you level up to unlock new classes, compete with friends and buy entertaining skill lessons (like ‘flirting’) with virtual currency.It might also help to know that Duolingo is 100% free, and totally legit: it was previously chosen by Apple as iPhone App of the Year and by Google as Best of the Best for Android, and it happens to be the world’s most popular learning app with over 110 million users!Why did I start using Duolingo in the first place? My decision to even use Duolingo in the first place comes from a broader realization I had a few years ago. As someone who used to chronically set lofty goals and chronically abandon them (as my dusty, barely-touched saxophone can testify to), it finally clicked that I was setting goals that were overly-ambitious and difficult to measure. Rewriting my goal of ‘getting fit’ to ‘be able to do 100 pushups in one day by the end of the year’ was the difference between failing and succeeding for me.Note: if you have Mark Zuckerberg-esque abilities to conquer outrageously ambitious resolutions, ignore everything I’ve just said!As a result, this year, I rewrote my previously unsuccessful resolution of 'learning a new language' to 'complete the Duolingo Spanish course in one year with ten minutes of practice everyday.' It worked.And for 2016?Now that this year went reasonably well, I feel pretty comfortable setting two language-related New Year's resolutions for 2016: i) read 4 Spanish novels (>200 pages) and watch 3 Spanish TV shows (any genre), and ii) finish the Esperanto course on Duolingo with 10 minutes of practice everyday.Oh, and my non-language learning New Year’s resolution is to start being on time for everything. I suck at that.Good luck and happy learning :)"

First thing first, move 1𝑥1x\frac{1}{x} to the right side of the equal sign, like this𝑥=−1𝑥x=−1xx = -\frac{1}{x}If you see this pattern, you want to move 𝑥xx variable from the right side to the other side, like this𝑥×𝑥=−1x×x=−1x \times x = -1Now, we know that 𝑥×𝑥x×xx \times x is equal to 𝑥2x2x^2, so𝑥2=−1x2=−1x^2 = -1Next step, we will square root both side, like this𝑥2‾‾‾√=−1‾‾‾√x2=−1\sqrt{x^2} = \sqrt{-1}We know that 𝑥2‾‾‾√x2\sqrt{x^2} is equal to 𝑥xx, but what about −1‾‾‾√−1\sqrt{-1}?

766,"Mutual funds? In Detail!! That should be like an answer for 25 marks question.So, assuming that you want to invest in mutual funds and want to know about them before you start investing in them, I would be answering it from an investors point of view and will not go in details about how to set them, wats an AMC, etc. stuffs.Mutual fund, as the name suggests, is a fund, which is owned mutually by all those who put in it. There are 2 main reasons of why mutual funds are formed:1. For a ordinary person, who knows not much about markets, about investing, its very difficult to manage money. He wouldnt know how to track a stock, or how to value it? So, for these people, a simple way is just to give there money to someone else who can manage it properly and help you in growing it. But, you can not give all your life’s saving just to anyone. What if the person you gave money ran away with it?? Thats why mutual funds are set up, so that you can put your money into funds and they will manage it. Since, Fund is managed by AMC, and AMCs are monitored by trusts, your money is safe. Plus these fund managers are intelligent, a keep track of markets and stuffs, they are very much qualified to manage money.2. Another reason is to take advantage of scale and diversity. Suppose you only have Rs. 2,000 with you, and you want to invest it into a stock, which costs around Rs 4,000? You just cannot buy a half stock, and you dont have enough money to buy a single share. Or you want to diversify your portfolio to reduce market risk, but you cannot buy 10 different stock with your small amount. So what will you do? You put your money into a Fund, similar to you, other people also give their money to the the fund, and now fund will have enough money and it can buy any stock it wants. It can also diversify it across multiple stocks to reduce its risk.So thats the main purpose of why funds are formed. Next comes is how are they operated?So, while setting up a fund, the fund manager decides that it wants a total of, for example, Rs 1 crore (total corpus also known as AUM). So, what the AMC will do is, divide Rs. 1 crore in to small parts of Rs. 50 each, so 2lakhs parts in total. Now this Rs. 50 will be the initial NAV of the Fund, at which you or any other person can just buy the units from the AMC. So, if you have Rs. 2000, you will get 40 units. The AMC will then you all the money collected and invest it. As it invests by buying stock, bonds, etc the value of total Rs 1 crore will change, depend upon the current value of all the shares, bonds purchased. So suppose, the current value totals to Rs1.2 crore. Since there were 2lakhs ubits, the NAV will now be Rs1.2 crore divided by 2 lakh units, i.e. Rs. 60. that means the Rs.2000 you invested at Rs. 50 has now become Rs 60 and your total investment is Rs2400. Similar would be the effect if the value of total corpus fall.So, this is what a mutual fund is.If you want to know any specific or anything more, then message me or reply to this."
767,"There are two sides to this question:Do you mean the actual columns within a text frame ?Or the column guides, which appear in the page view ?Part 1The actual columns (and gutter) within a text frame can be set directly in the top Control bar, when you have selected a text frame with the Move tool. You can also use the command Object – Text Frame Options to set these numbers as well. This is the oldest and simplest feature in InDesign.However, in this top section of the dialogue you can also let the number of columns be related to the size of the text frame by stating a column’s minimum width, so it can change dynamically when the frame is being stretched manually or automatically by Alternative Layout adjustments. This is a less older option. Read all about it.Another way to set columns is to Spread or Split Columns based on the Paragraph setting. This is the most recent feature (CS5). Check it out…Part 2The initial Column Guides setting can be found in the New Document dialogue (creating the guides on the Master Page), and afterwards on any page or the Master Page in the Layout – Margins & Columns command.The columns guides can also be unevenly distributed by unlocking them through the View – Grids & Guides command and simply grabbing them with the Move tool."
768,"I've owned several acoustic bass guitars.  I keep one for convenience when I need to grab a bass and sit on the patio or figure out a song in a hurry.  The first, and best, was a Martin BM.  It was a plain Jane with a satin finish and a transducer. No tone, volume or EQ controls.  Just a 1/4"" jack in the end pin.  It had a wonderful tone and good volume without electric amplification.  I eventually sold it to ""upgrade"" to a Martin 16GTAE bass.  This bass had a better finish and better electronics but lacked the warm tone and volume of the BM when I played it unplugged.  I was never completely happy with it.I sold the 16GTAE and now I have a National resonator bass with a highlander pickup.  It's the loudest acoustic bass I have owned but it does have a slightly metallic tone like a resonator guitar.  It's not bad but it can be a little harsh sounding in a jam session, depending on the type of music being played.The Taylor AB basses (discontinued) are highly valued by collectors but they don't have much volume unplugged.  I almost bought one a couple of times when you could still find them in stores.  That's how I first found the Martin BM, shopping for a Taylor AB.  I couldn't talk myself into spending $2k on the Taylor so I picked up the Martin BM just to hear it and I was amazed at the sound.  It only cost $800, so it was a bargain.  I should have held onto her when I still had the chance.Long story, short ending.  If you can find a Martin BM (discontinued) for sale somewhere give her a try.  I think you'll be happy with it.  I know I was.  Good luck!"

770,"I don’t understand what u mean by your maths have become extremely weak. Were they strong earlier? What is the basis on which u are saying this?Please note that performance is std X board exams in Maths should not be considered as a reflection of your strength in that subject. The same also applies to Science.Board exams are more a test of memory than understanding, so scoring there is not necessarily an indication of your understanding of the subject.My personal view is that board exams are only there due to the selfish interests of uneducated state education ministers who fear that they will become jobless or reduce in importance if these no longer exist. That’s why they have retained these.Thankfully, from this year, IITs and NITs have decided not to accept the board marks in calculating the rankings of JEE Main. So only the people who have a good understanding of Science and Maths, which are the pillars of engineering, will be able to join good engg. colleges. Board marks are going to be used only as eligibility criteria, though.If you are not sure of your strength in Maths, then you should review your choice of engineering as a career in the first place. No point in becoming an engineer at any cost thru a sub-standard engg. college and joining the 80% jobless engineers who are already there."
771,"At first approximation, a function in a functional language is like a mathematical function: for every value in its domain it produces a unique value in its codomain. But if you dig deeper, you'll find out that things are not that simple. First of all, a programming language can only implement computable functions. You have to provide an algorithm to calculate the value. This algorithm has to be written using language constructs, so the question is, what subset of mathematical functions can be implemented using those constructs?You quickly find out that without some kind of looping or recursion, your powers are quite limited. The simplest kind of recursion is one in which, with every step of the algorithm, you decrement some counter, until it reaches zero. This way you can, for instance, calculate the factorial of any number. The important part is that you have a counter that is decremented, so you are guaranteed to reach zero and finish the calculation in finite time. This is called primitive recursion. Unfortunately, it can be proven that primitive recursion is not powerful enough to implement every computable function. Then there is general recursion, which doesn't have a natural counter. This one is powerful enough but it has a different problem: some of the functions you can define will never terminate. And there is no in-between that would let you implement all computable functions but eliminate non-termination. So functions in a (Turing-complete) functional language correspond to computable functions in mathematics, plus non-terminating procedures."
772,"Most of the answers on this thread are fairly incomplete, inaccurate or outright boring.Let me explain them in a lucid and fun way.Imagine you’re a boss of a cotton firm. You produce 1 quintal of cotton every month. You have workers under you. The production cost is necessarily less than selling cost. The boss takes apart aside called profit and distribute the rest to the worker as wages. This is called capitalism.Imagine, if there was no boss and workers get the value of cotton they produce with no scope of profit is socialism.Socialism emerged as a protest against capitalism.[1]Capitalism is based on profit.Socialism is based on need.Capitalism is survival of the fittest.Socialism is focused on the welfare of least advantaged groups.In capitalism, capitalists are exploiters.In socialism, workers are exploiters.In capitalism, the state is controlled by the capitalist.In socialism, the state is controlled by workers.Some additional knowledge about socialism:The word socialism is used quite often in media and political speeches. It was also added to Indian constitution’s preamble through 42nd amendment. India is also a country which claims to be based on socialist principles but hardly seen post-1991 economic reforms of LPG.[2]Hence, endless varieties seem to emerge. Socialism was called a “hat[3]that lost its shape” by C.E.M. Joad.[4]Socialism stands for:Social and economic equality.Man is social by nature.Society is natural and prior to man.Then Karl Marx came into the picture in the 19th century, he influenced the socialism so much so that socialism began to be called before and after Marx.Marx reiterated that the French revolutionaries like Louis Blanc lack the understanding of capitalism.Hence after Marx, Revisionists, Fabianism, guild socialism and syndicalism followed. All these schools of thought are a subject matter of another answer.Marx is among the few philosophers by whose name a school of thought is established.Karl MarxHe was a materialist.[5] He was also a critique of religion and called it an opium of the masses.[6]Marx was neither the first or the last socialist. He is the most important personality in the evolution of socialism. He called the socialism propounded by others as utopian and called himself scientific.His works can be divided into two broad categories as young and mature Marx where young Marx talks about economic and philosophical manuscripts and the concept of alienation and mature Marx wrote a communist manifesto and Das Kapital.[7]He famously quoted:“In order to make history one has to live; in order to live one has to eat; in order to eat one has to produce. Hence it is for the production that man has formed society”( and not the other way round)Economic structure is a “base” of all other structures. Only when the economic structure changes, the superstructure can be changed.Socialism was one of the stages of a transition from capitalism to communism.According to Marx, socialism will come through violent revolution and overthrow of capitalism. This was the transitional stage and communism will follow.In communism, the private property is abolished. Classes will be abolished and class struggle will end.When struggle ends following that dialectics end and following that history ends.Hence, it is said that the communism is the end of history.End of history meant the end of contradiction.In communism, the state shall wither away as the state was an instrument of the propertied class.Communism is a society where people get thing according to their needs.But you may now wonder that Marx might be opposite to industrialisation given he called it an instrument of the bourgeois. Marx supported industrialization and supported mass production by machines to fulfil the need of every person.Marx called communism a state of perfect freedom. Freedom from necessities. Man is free and he does what he wanted to do.Freedom in capitalist society is not free but it is false consciousness which leads to alienation and isolation.Conclusion:Socialism stood as an opposition to Capitalism.Karl Marx influenced socialism like no other and explained the economic structure and dictatorship of bourgeoisie through it. He wanted a revolution. He wanted a violent overthrow of capitalists. Marxism is a school based on Marx's idea which regarded socialism as a transition stage to communism.For Marx, communism is a state of freedom and away from false consciousness.[8]Charles Tips also answered this question beautifully: Charles Tips's answer to What's the difference between Socialism, Marxism and Communism?AFootnotes[1] Karl Marx (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy)[2] 1991: Economic Reforms[3] Socialism is like a hat that has lost its shape because  everybody wears i[4] C.E.M.

774,"I sit very still so I can hear words playing notes - music - in my mind.Or, I experiment with sounds.Example:I was searching for the precise word to end this sentence:She poured soul and skills into her stories that have wobbly plots buried under too many words known as loquacity of periphrasis, and all these words…(blank).So, I flicked a crystal goblet with my finger to hear the crystal ring clear. Then filled the goblet one third of the way with water, and flicked it again and again to different tempos. I liked the beat that sounded like hiccups.I lost myself to fun. Playing.As expected, a word revealed itself - a surprising word - hiccup.That sentence became:She poured soul and skills into her stories that have wobbly plots buried under too many words known as loquacity of periphrasis, and all these words hiccup.Playing like this works well for creative writing.And exceptionally well when you are focused on developing original voice.It works superbly when writing stories that sway emotions. Or when you simply want to undress feelings and be vulnerable. Nude. Raw. Truthful. Faithful to what you feel. And you want the reader to become engaged with you on a deep feeling level.I used the sound method to write this answer:Dakota Lim's answer to What are writers most likely to dislike when they revisit their old prose?Caveat.The sound method will not work when you are explaining how to solve IQ puzzles or writing analytical essays or reports.In that case you would use your mental kinetic skills. I used mental kinetic skills to write this answer: Dakota Lim's answer to Can you solve this IQ test puzzle from Mensa? I just cannot find its solution.Caveat.The mental kinetic skills method will not work when you are writing about visual aesthetics.

775,"Q- Why I feel dizzy when I am playing some 3D games but others do not make me feel like this?A- This mostly happens due to low FOV. In case of Fallout 4 in 1st person mode FOV is 70. I guess 90 or more would be better. You need to manually change it.Do following things to overcome this:Ridiculously low FOV- It might be the (FOV) field of view! You can change it in the config or .ini file(s).  This link may help you out: Easily change your FOV settings with this Fallout 4 mod You should play Fallout 4 in 3rd person mode and zoom back.

776,"Like any business, payroll companies need to make a profit. But where does this profit come from?Most of it doesn't come from the invoices they submit to you -- this amount is minimal. Rather, they profit from floating the interest that is compounded on funds from your account before your payroll is paid out. Payroll companies typically will wait until the last possible minute to transfer your funds, and keep any interest earned on your money.However, because interest is so low now days, payroll services have had to be inventive in increasing their profits, just like any other company. It is no secret that vendors who bid on government contracts go in with unbelievably low bids to get the job. Where they make their money is with changes that come up during the building process which can cost double what the same job would have cost if it had been included in the original bid. This bidding process is used by a lot of industries. A company bids on a specific plan or service and somewhere along the line a CEO or division manager wants to make a change. Changes are how companies make more profit.Are you contributing to their bottom line?A payroll company also makes money from the frequency of your payroll plan. For example, a 20-employee company on a weekly pay schedule might spend $1,800 per year for payroll processing. But if that same company switched to a bi-weekly schedule, they would pay approximately $1,100. In short, providers benefit from how often they are providing a service to you.In addition, payroll firms rake in more cash by offering other payroll-related services, including payroll distribution, tax filing, data collection, and a newer, growing area -- benefit management services. Like a business searching for building bids it is in your best interest to look at your short term and long term needs. By adding a service into the original package you may negotiate favorable rates. However, if you add a service six months to a year or more after you have been with the payroll provider, the additional service may cost a lot more. Make a concerted effort to determine exactly what you need before accepting any packaged payroll services.Payroll service firms can also charge fees for extras like tailoring the format of reports generated with your payroll information. Almost all firms will accept a format that you suggest, if you can provide it on software that is compatible with their own.We are not advocating eliminating profits for a payroll provider. That would be absurd. However, the more insight you have on the profit source of payroll providers, the better you can choose an appropriate vendor. Done wisely, you can save some money and then re-invest your savings back into your own business.For more details you can visit our website- Payroll Managed Services | Payroll Services in India"
777,DOCTOR STRANGEMost overrated i will say Doctor Strange because it was like seeing IRONMAN lookalike dawn the avatar of a super hero with power of magic and with same level of wit and humor and story line up also same .MCU is just trying to make up money by making this type of copy of there own movies by taking some other characters.I am not a hater of this movie as 3d effects were great and there was my one of the most beloved actor Benedict Cumberbatch but rather tan this i would have love to say the movie was great but that didn’t happened.THE GIRL WITH THE DRAGON TATTOOThis was well made novel adaptation of same name by the one of the gem of hollywood DAVID FINCHER. This movie had right to own more than just it got i know that it was received average by audience and critics but i see it as a classic in genre of thriller movies of all time and it should have earned more respect. Thats my point.Thanks for reading and do give your valuable suggestion if u think so. I know there are lot of movies but this two are the one which popped in my mind first. I will add more on basis of suggestion.

779,"I've programmed a lot with both C and C++. I'm going to tell you something shocking (compared to the other answers, anyway):Don't learn C before C++.C++ has diverged so far from C, that learning C first won't gain you much of anything, and there will be lots of things you have to unlearn if you want to be good at C++. For example:The standard I/O library in C is called stdio; the standard I/O library in C++ is called IOStreams. You generally don't want to use stdio in C++ code: it's not extensible, and it's type-unsafe.C-style casts is the only casting style that you can use in C, but its use is frowned upon in C++; one should always prefer C++-style casts (static_cast, dynamic_cast, etc.), which are much safer.Also, C++ makes a much, much bigger deal of RAII (which doesn't exist in C) and const-correctness than C does. You will want to get those right from day one.Yes, eventually if you get to an advanced level of C++, you will want to learn about how some C++ features (e.g., RTTI, exceptions, etc.) are implemented at a low level, and knowing C may help with that. But that's not for beginners, for sure. C++ beginners should just learn high-level C++ concepts, and leave low-level C concepts out of it.One of my favourite books that teaches C++ at this high level is Accelerated C++. It is an oldie but a goodie: ""It remains one of the best books around"", C++ expert James Kanze says.Another book I want to suggest is Programming—Principles and Practice Using C++ by Bjarne Stroustrup; I haven't read that particular book, but I have read a couple of other C++ titles by Stroustrup and really liked them."
780,"No.  The sensor is not good enough.  Same issue for Jawbone's UP and Nike Fuel.  The swing of your arm or bounce of your body clocks the steps...it won't pick up the movement on a bike.  You still need to get a bike computer (pretty cheap and reasonable) to mount to your handle bars.  You can also get a ton more data out of more advanced technology on your bike.  Wattometers such as SRM and Power Meters will show you real time power output, speed, RPMs and heart rate.Update: I've used the Nike Fuel band for the past week now and though it does not track your distance on a bike (moving, not stationary), it does give you ""credit"" for activity with their proprietary/bespoke metric they are calling the ""FUEL SCORE.""  It also seems to do a decent job of tracking calories burned.  I compared, for example, my KJ burn from my SRM powermeter to the calories burned on my Fuel Band, it the two numbers were pretty close.  I've been more impressed with this device than I thought I would be."
781,"[Originally asked: Is there any archaeological proof that Jesus existed?]YES.There is more archaeological proof for Jesus’ existence than for virtually any other figure from ancient history.There’s an abundance of corroborating archaeological evidence; a great amount of the people, cities, places, etc. of Jesus’ life and ministry are established in the archaeological record. I’ll summarize a lot of that at the end of this answer.But when it comes to Jesus specifically, the best proof we have is the Bible.Many people will object here. They will deny that the Bible can ever be used as proof of Jesus.But this question doesn’t get to make that objection. You asked for archaeological evidence of Jesus’ existence, and the Bible fits the bill perfectly.This wasn’t always the case. Back when the King James Version was first translated from the Greek (roughly 400 years ago in 1611 A.D/C.E.), they had reference to perhaps a dozen Greek manuscripts of the New Testament. None of these were particularly old; they were removed from the time of Jesus by many hundreds, if not a thousand, years.In such a situation, you could imagine all sorts of changes occurring in the text between the time it was first written to the time it was translated.But then came archaeology.In the last 150 years, archaeologists have dug up thousands of ancient biblical manuscripts. Today we have over 10,000 manuscripts of the New Testament in the original languages, stretching back in time to the early 2nd and late 1st centuries.In all of this, there is no evidence of the content changing over time.There are minor scribal issues, of course. There will always be minor copy issues when human agents perform the copying. But given the abundance of manuscripts, we can easily spot and correct these changes.The evidence is so strong that even Bart Ehrman, one of the staunchest skeptics around, agrees. Out of the nearly 8,000 verses in the New Testament, Ehrman might quibble on perhaps a dozen, and none of these affect the teaching or beliefs of Christianity. They’re all exceedingly minor issues. (For a complete interview with Ehrman on this subject, consult the appendix of Ehrman’s book Misquoting Jesus, which establishes this information and much more).What does all this have to do with archaeological proof for Jesus?Everything.Consider the impact of these three facts, all of which archaeology has established for the New Testament:It was written during the lifetimes of the eye-witnesses to Jesus.It was published in the lands where the events happened, while tens of thousands of eye-witnesses could put the lie to anything in them that wasn’t accurate.It was not changed over time; the content of the New Testament today is the same as when it was first written.All this happened during a time when Jesus’ enemies held all the power and tried to destroy Christianity in any way possible. And yet they never charged the Bible with any kind of inaccuracy, nor did they attempt to argue that Jesus didn’t exist.Robert Van Voorst searched the first few centuries A.D./C.E and concluded clearly:“… [N]o pagans and Jews who opposed Christianity denied Jesus’ historicity or even questioned it.”(Van Voorst, Jesus Outside, p. 15)He elaborates:“… [I]f anyone in the ancient world had a reason to dislike the Christian faith, it was the rabbis. To argue successfully that Jesus never existed but was a creation of early Christians would have been the most effective polemic against Christianity … [Yet] all Jewish sources treated Jesus as a fully historical person … [T]he rabbis … used the real events of Jesus’ life against him”(Van Voorst, Jesus Outside, pp. 133–134, emphasis added)Jesus’ enemies unintentionally did Him a great service: they corroborated the accounts written about Him. They used the real events of Jesus’ life against Him, which you only do when you cannot deny that those events happ..."

783,"Its is none other than Raja Digvijaya Singh !!Confused ?First of all, it is one of the biggest misconception that Shri Rahul Rajiv Indira Jawaharlal Motilal Gandhi is the PM candidate of Congress. Rahul ji was never interested in that post, neither he was born for such a small post. Rahul ji will be the next NAC Chairman when Congress returns.Now, why Digvijay ji among all other Congress man ? Here are the reasons :Aggressive leader : Digvijay ji is the Indian answer to Vladimir Putin. You simply dont wanna mess with him or confront him face to face.Once a person waived his slippers at one of Diggy sir’s party man. Guess what happened ? Diggy sir did this :Now, just imagine Chinese President Xi Jinping in place of this protestor !!A young worker from opposition youth organization once dared to show a black flag to Diggy sir to protest against one of his remarks. Result :Court grants bail to Digvijay Singh, MP in assault case2. Inspiration to youth : Did I say that he is India’s answer to only Vladimir Putin ? Digvijay Singh is India’s answer to Bill Clinton, Nicholas Sarkozy and Silvio Berlusconi as well :While most of us easily give up after a couple of rejections or break-ups and are not able to start from new, Diggy sir has set a perfect example by starting fresh at 69 (the age) with Amrita Rai ji who is only 28 years younger than him. They have set a perfect example : love is pure, love knows no age, love knows no society. It is selfless.Besides, he has inspired millions of Indian engineers like me that an engineer can woo a beautiful girl, even if it gets as late as 69 years but an engineer should never give up and keep on hitting on beautiful women till he succeeds ! ( Diggy sir is an engineer).In video below, Diggy sir calls his party colleague as ‘tunch maal’. Which woman wont fall for such catchy lines !!In his spare time, Diggy sir frequently promotes classical Indian culture amongst youth and provides a “platform” to talented young artists :3. International Diplomacy : Most Indian leaders make the mistake of trying to get in the good books of US Prez, UK PM or Japan’s PM. What they dont realize that these countries will anyway come to India because India is a huge market. Diggy sir is a bit different. He due to his secular nature, is in good books of terrorist leaders.When Osama Bin Laden was killed, all world leaders expressed happiness for his death. Only Diggy sir stood for the right thing, he mourned for Laden.Digvijay Singh calls 'Osama Bin Laden' as 'Osama Ji' - IBTLHe addressed Laden sir as Osama ji (ji is a term used with a person’s name to show respect). Similarly, when Pakistani terrorists trained their ass off, crossed border and sacrificed their lives to slain Indian civilians on 26/11, Diggy sir instead gave the credit of all their hard work to an organization called RSS (Rashtriya Swayam sevak Sangh), which mostly comprises of his political opponents.Now, imagine yourself in place of Al-Zawahiri (Al-Qaeda chief). You are planning to attack India and give a message that Sharia is coming to India soon. But you have a person leading India, who has only respect for you, your organization and your ex-boss. He is more Muslim than most of you out there. Besides that, you also know that all credit of your hardwork will go to RSS and your message that the age of hardcore Sharia Islam has arrived in India will go nowhere. Here your guy dies in the name of 72 virgins and there the Indian PM refuses to acknowledge that instead saying that the guy was a Hindu terrorist and died in the name of idol-worship. What do you do in this situation ? How will you motivate your Al-Qaeda cadre to kill Indians ? How will you tell them to harm the country men of Osama fan Diggy ? You can’t. Hence, he will have to spare India.Similarly, Diggy sir has registered himself in good books of Islamic scholar Zakir Naik (the person ..."

785,"Love him or hate him, Donald J. Trump is a winner.  And it's in our human nature to love a winner.  That isn't to say that the billionaire real estate developer, business mogul and celebrity star of the hit show, ""The Apprentice,""  doesn't have his detractors; far from it.   But to answer the question of ""can Trump win the Presidential election,"" let's first take a moment to appreciate what ""The Donald"" has endured and overcome to arrive as the last man standing for the Republican nomination:Took on 16 contenders for the Republican Party nomination emerging victorious even before the election process was complete.   No easy feat when you consider that several of these challengers were former governors with excellent records.  Scott Walker, before he withdrew early, was an up and coming star in the Republican Party as governor of Wisconsin disrupting the teacher's unions and balancing the state budget.  Rick Perry equally had an excellent record as governor in Texas as did John Kasich in Ohio.  Jeb Bush not only had a good record as governor of Florida but was also the chosen candidate by the establishment elites as the best hope for winning a national presidential election.   It's estimated that these big money donors spent in excess of $100 million dollars before Jeb finally suspended his campaign. And Ted Cruz was a fierce competitor and darling of the evangelical and conservative tea party movement.  Withstood an almost daily barrage of media attacks by reporters, political commentators, opinion makers and Washington beltway elites that have repeatedly engraved the demise of his political career like a tombstone on the front page of such prestigious publications as the Wall Street Journal, the Washington Post and The New York Times.Endured criticisms from Mexico's president, Vicente Fox, from a billionaire Saudi Prince and from UK's prime minister David Cameron including a referendum to ban Trump altogether from the country.  (Look out, apologies are now incoming).Weathered cancellation of his Miss Universe Pageant on NBC and Univision, boycotts of his clothing line by Macy's and attempted cancellation of building projects in Saudi Arabia and Scotland. Survived endless organized attacks at his rallies and press conferences by paid operatives and plants to embarrass and malign his character that would later be played and commented on by news outlets across the country.  This included attempts to stop him from speaking altogether at his rallies, successfully in Chicago and as was nearly the case  in San Francisco.Tolerated constant criticism from the Republican party establishment suggesting they would never back him promising a contested convention to nominate the candidate of their own choosing.  This at the same time requiring Trump to publicly pledge not to run as a third party candidate.  And throughout it all, The Donald was undaunted, never backing down, never apologizing and never afraid to fight back quietly amassing support.  Time and again, after each media, political or financial attack, the world watched and waited for the expected inevitable back peddling, apology and promise of corrective behavior.  After all, this is what every politician does and the public dictates and demands what is considered politically correct.  Yet, time and again, Trump was defiant and brash, doubling-down on his previous positions.  What the media and PC police missed, was that they did not create Trump, and he is not theirs to destroy.  This is especially true since he is self-funded and not a career politician.  And to a great many Americans that have had their fill of politicians with no backbone willing to surrender their positions and values for political advantage, Trump gained their respect.  They love him for his strength and independence referring to him colloquially as the ""blue-collar billionaire.""   Americans knew that here was something unique that they hadn't seen before, nor may never see again. But there is something else.  Donald Trump is transformative.  When Bruce Lee set about reinventing the art of Kung Fu, his genius was to recognize that the rigid traditional moves that everyone obeyed were too formal and unnecessary to achieve quick effective results.  Through his brand of genius, Donald Trump also performed his own kind of Kung Fu.  Throughout the debates and at his rallies, Donald never used a teleprompter nor rehearsed and memorized his lines.  This allowed him to speak from the heart and directly to the American public.  Preferring not to delve into great detail, he focused on effective but memorable lines.  This led to some very interesting exchanges with Jeb Bush in particular where the tired formulaic attacks were tried such as:""You think this is tough, wait til you have to deal with Putin and ISIS."" which was responded by ""Yeah, you're a real tough guy Jeb.""  and 'I wish it was always as easy as you Jeb.""  This rendered Jeb ineffective and speechless as well as other debaters using well rehearsed lines. And Trump's ability for presentation and showmanship is equally matched by his ability to read the American people.  He has correctly identified and championed those ideas that are most important to working class Americans such as immigration, trade negotiations, national defense, the war on terror, healthcare, job creation and the economy.  These issues cut across all demographics - all ages, genders, races, religions, education and income levels.  That's because his platform is not set up to appeal to or divide sections of the electorate. His message appeals to Republicans, Democrats and and Independents alike.  And Bernie Sanders supporters have many of these same concerns.  Ideologically, they may be closer to Hillary Clinton but on their views of Washington establishment politicians and Wall Street collusion, they are one and the same with Trump.  Once Bernie is gone, these supporters are likely to jump the ideological divide or not vote at all.  Some have suggested the electoral college is stacked against any Republican candidate.  With his transformative appeal, these analysts have ignored how Trump will likely rewrite the political map.  If estimates are correct, only 59% of the white vote turned out for Romney in 2012.  Those missing are disaffected voters that are clearly coming out for Trump and can amount to between 6 and 10 million people even if he increases this turnout by just 4%. Above all, Donald Trump promises to make America great again.  When you think back to the American 20th Century, it was a great one. Now think about the American headlines of today. What do you think of? War? Poverty? Political division?  Do we see greatness in America still on a daily basis or even in the movies?  What I remember is our own President on a world wide apology tour criticizing America's reprehensible role in leading the way in economic growth and concepts of personal freedom and submitting accusations of human rights violations to the UN. And instinct should tell you that when someone stands by their principles at the cost of their own image and pocketbook, they have altruistic goals in mind.  So when Trump says he wants to make America great again, I believe him. We are likely to see a showdown between Hillary Clinton (assuming she is not indicted) and Donald Trump in a national election.  Hillary is a direct link to the policies of the Obama administration and a stalled economy.  We know what Trump stands for, but why is Hillary running other than to be President and reward Washington and Wall Street elites with government policy favors?  So far, Hillary has faced almost no criticism from Bernie Sanders.  Sanders has avoided confrontations publicly about her email server, the Benghazi scandal, the scandalous Clinton foundation, her acceptance of payoffs for political favors as Secretary of State and finally her payoffs from Goldman-Sachs and others on Wall Street.  As we've seen with the Republican nomination process, Trump understands that labeling and identification are effective.  Besides ""crooked Hillary,"" Trump will begin pushing a common theme: bad judgement.  Voted for the Iraq war - bad judgement.  Failed to act in defending Ambassador Stevens and his staff - bad judgement.  Allowed the selling off of strategic reserves of U.S. uranium to Russia - bad judgement.  Keeping a private email server that was later hacked by the Russians and Chinese - bad judgement.  So do I think Donald Trump is going to win the Presidential election?  It goes without saying but I'll put an exclamation point on it.  In a landslide!"
786,"Jasmine said most of what I think. Good answer. Companies like Google have seen through all the trendy bluster surrounding agile (especially the fetid abomination that is Scrum), they've taken the few bits of the process that work and dumped all the management fad cruft (of which there is rather a lot). They have realised that every developer is different, each developer has their own processes that they work best with, and that the focus should be on the end product, not how to get there.I'm OK with using a Kanban board. I'm even OK with end user-centric tasks to a certain extent. That's more or less where it ends.I am not OK with the stupid, asinine terminology. We're developers. Do we really need more rubbish terminology in our lives? I am not OK with the short-termism of 'sprints' that inevitably end up with you having to refactor code time and time again when the next set of 'user stories' come in. I am not OK with the lack of strategic thinking when it comes to program design and software architecture.I am not OK with blatant micromanagement masquerading as 'the next big thing'. I am not OK with 'story points' or 'planning poker'. These are estimates of effort, not time, and hence utterly useless. I am not OK with daily standups. The Kanban board should tell everyone what they need to know, not this silly ritual lifted straight from Alcoholics Anonymous. I am not OK with all the other meetings either. Waste of good development time. Write me a f**king email. I am not OK with 'agile coaches' - the dev world's evangelical religious zealots peddling their ridiculous creed to companies on the promise of increased productivity, new jobs for increasingly irrelevant middle management (scrum masters and product owners) and the chance to say they do something trendy like 'agile', and then charge the company a fortune for the privilege. But, most of all, I am not OK with the homogenisation of developers that takes place in Scrum environments. It's extremely hard to be creative and do any out-of-the-box thinking when you're being micromanaged. And there's a whole generation of young developers coming into the workplace and thinking this is how it's supposed to be done. WTF?"

Madhuri Dixit’s joyous moves in this song in the movie ‘Tezaab’ were choreographed by master choreographer Saroj Khan and created a sensation in the country.Ek Do Teen​Dhak Dhak , a song sung by Anuradha Paudhwal and Udit Narayanan from the hit movie ‘Beta’ is another iconic song where Saroj Khan again showcased  Madhuri’s sexy side with some bosom thrusts and subtle lighting. Her orange sari and blouse and chemistry with Anil Kapoor are still remembered.Dhak Dhak​Madhuri danced to the koli number Hum Ko Aaj Tak Hai with such gusto that people forgot the movie and just looked at her. This song sung by Anupama Deshpande for the forgettable movie ‘ Sailaab’ made full play of her enticing expressions and body language.Hum Ko Aaj Kal Hai​Didi Tera Dewar Deewana from the movie ‘Hum Aapke Hain Kaun…!’ is sung by Lata Mangeshkar and S.P. Balasubramaniam, is one of those dance numbers that exhibitsher playful side. Her much copied blouse and purple sari were a huge hit with the ladies and the song became a fixture at weddings.Didi Tera Dewar Deewana​The not-so-successful and grim ‘Anjaam’ boasted of the immensely playful ‘Chane Ke Khet Mein’. Her expressions in this song sung by Poornima were copied by girls of all ages and so were her moves.Chane Ke Khet Mein​Choli ke Peeche created a huge controversy because of its lyrics, but the popularity of this song sung by Ila Arun and Alka Yagnik was propelled mainly because of Madhuri’s dancing and its folk based beats. ‘Khalnayak’ is still remembered for this Madhuri number.Choli Ke Peeche Kya Hai​Lavish sets and a beautiful courtesan, Madhuri dressed in a heavy period costume whirling toMaar daala in ‘Devdas’ remains an indelible memory in Madhuri’s many fans’ minds. Her classical dance based steps in this Kavita Krishnamurthy sung song clearly tells us what a brilliant dancer she really is.Maar Daala​Dekha Hai Pehli Baar is another hit song Of Madhuri’s sung by Alka Yagnik and S.P. Balasubramaniam. This romantic song from the super hit movie ‘Saajan’ shows a young Madhuri in the throes of young love.Dekha Hai Pehli Baar​Akhiyan Milaun is a great dance number picturised on Madhuri and Sanjay Kapoor in the movie ‘Raja’. Her fun expressions and funky dance moves made this song a huge hit. The song was well sung by Alka Yagnik and Udit Narayanan.Akhiyan Milaun..."
789,"Nucleoplasm is made primarily of water, ions and a various mixture of other molecules. It is a fairly sticky liquid that is completely enclosed within the nuclear membrane. It serves as a suspension medium for all of the organelles inside the nucleus, and it also helps maintain the shape and structure of the nucleus."
790,"Well, in fact, the best evidence for evolution in the fossil record is all of it. Let me explain.I'll start with the story of a precambrian bunny. The precambrian bunny is a mythical creature. It wandered the earth, nomming on the Ediacaran fauna. Stuff like: Arkarua adamiand Charnia masoni, a tasty little thing that may look like a fern, but in fact lived in water so deep that photosynthesis was not possible. Our bunny was  good swimmer.Okay, this is rather absurd. It's perfectly understandable that bunnies could not have lived during this period of time. Of course, if you think about it, why is it that scientists can recognize that different forms of life lived in different periods of time? Why is it, that the further back in time you go, the less life looks like it does today?We can start with geology. Strata are laid down horizontally, and form under a lot of different conditions. Limestone, for instance, is made up of the ""skeletal fragments of organisms"" or ""by the chemical precipitation of calcite or aragonite""Sandstone is made from, well, sand. ""[T]he sand becomes sandstone when it is compacted by pressure of overlying deposits and cemented by the precipitation of minerals within the pore spaces between sand grains.""So, what's the point. Well, the strata that fossils are found within can tell us about the environment in which they lived. And since strata are laid down horizontally, the deeper the stratum the further back in time it was deposited. This, absent any absolute dating techniques can provide a rough, relative age of the fossils.That was geology. Now lets talk Phylogeny. Phylogeny is the study of how species are related to each other. A phylogenic tree is a picture of how life is related. The further away from the branches (which are modern species or dead ends) the further back in time. This is because, necessarily, the descendants of a population must come after it's ancestors.From this we can draw the conclusions that stratigraphy should correlate with phylogeny. In general we should find ancestors lower in the stratigraphic record than we find descendants. This is why a precambrian bunny is so absurd. Bunnies are a recent species, the precambrian ended about 540 million years ago.But putting the bunny aside, we can get back to the general case: the correlation between stratigraphy and phylogeny. Because the fossil record is messy and because biology is messy, this is a necessarily statistical science.This excellent essay discusses this issue, 29+ Evidences for Macroevolution.Here is a quote of a quote within this essay:""... the RCI and SCI metrics showed impressive left-skewing; the majority of cladograms tested show good congruence between cladistic and stratigraphic information. Cladists and stratigraphers may breathe easy: the cladistic method appears, on the whole, to be finding phylogenies that may be close to the true phylogeny of life, and the sequence of fossils in the rocks is not misleading. ... it would be hard to explain why the independent evidence of the stratigraphic occurrence of fossils and the patterns of cladograms should show such striking levels of congruence if the fossil record and the cladistic method were hopelessly misleading."" (Benton and Hitchin 1997, p. 889)So, the end result is this. If evolution is true, then it is necessary that the order that fossils are laid down in the fossil record correlates with how those fossils are related. And when the whole fossil record is examined and measured against this expectation, it fits. In essence, all the fossil evidence supports evolution. How much more evidence would you need than all if it."

792,"You clone yourself in the next 4 months, and then go sit for both exams at the same time.What is with this question popping up like crazy every five minutes since the CAT announcement came out?On a serious note, it is obvious that this arrangement will be changed. Either the CAT or the IIFT exam will be postponed/preponed. There is no way both of them will have the same scheduled date. Most probably the IIFT exam will be changed, given how it’s the exam that fewer people take compared to CAT."
793,"Lots of creatures like Giants, Dragons, Unicorns, Cockatrice etc are mentioned.The greatest of all the beasts in the Bible is the Leviathan. This dragon-like creature features in all the pre-Biblical pagan mythologies of the Near East and even in India.God describes the Leviathan — a many-headed fire-breathing Sea-Dragon.Job 41:1 Moreover the Lord answered Job out of the whirlwind saying; "" ….. His teeth are terrible round about...... His appearance is full of light, and his eyes are like the rays of the dawn. Out of his mouth go burning lamps, and sparks of fire leap out. Out of his nostrils goes smoke, like a flame, spreading around the sides of a pot. His breath kindles coals, and a flame goes out of his mouth...... His meat is good and fat and it is nourishing.... Because of the fear of him, the mighty are afraid; and the strong are humbled............He brings to destruction whatever is proud. He is the King over all things in the deep.God fights with the Sea-Dragon and kills it.Ps. 74:13–14. It was you who split open the sea by your power; you broke the heads of the monster in the waters. It was you who crushed the heads of Leviathan and gave him as food to the creatures of the desert.Isa. 27:1 In that day the LORD with his sore and great and strong sword shall punish leviathan the piercing serpent, even leviathan that crooked serpent; and he shall slay the dragon that [is] in the sea.War in heaven between the angels and the dragonRev. 12:7 – 9. And there was war in heaven. Michael and his angels fought against the dragon, and the dragon and his angels fought back. But he was not strong enough, and they lost their place in heaven. The great dragon was hurled down — that ancient serpent called the devil, or Satan, who leads the whole world astray. He was hurled to the earth, and his angels with him.This is the same dragon that appears in the Canaanite mythology as Lotan which is killed by the god Hadad. In Mesopotamian religion it was Tiamat defeated by the god Marduk. In India it was Vrtra who was slain by Indra and in Norse mythology it was Jormungandr who was killed by Thor.Then there are the four beastly visions Ezekiel 1:4 – 12.The four living creatures. In appearance their form was that of a man, but each of them had four faces and four wings. Their legs were straight; their feet were like those of a calf and gleamed like burnished bronze. Under their wings on their four sides they had the hands of a man. All four of them had faces and wings, and their wings touched one another. Each one went straight ahead; they did not turn as they moved.Their faces looked like this: Each of the four had the face of a man, and on the right side each had the face of a lion, and on the left the face of an ox; each also had the face of an eagle. Such were their faces. Their wings were spread out upwards; each had two wings, one touching the wing of another creature on either side, and two wings covering its body. Each one went straight ahead. Wherever the spirit would go, they would go, without turning as they went.Rev.4:6 Also before the throne there was what looked like a sea of glass, clear as crystal. In the centre, around the throne, were four living creatures, and they were covered with eyes, in front and behind. 7. The first living creature was like a lion, the second was like an ox, the third had a face like a man, the fourth was like a flying eagle. 8. Each of the four living creatures had six wings and was covered with eyes all around, even under his wings. Day and night they never stop saying: ""Holy, holy, holy is the Lord God Almighty, who was, and is, and is to come."" 9. Whenever the living creatures give glory, honour and thanks to him who sits on the throne and who lives for ever and ever.Revelation 13:1-4 The beast from the sea.The BEHEMOTH“Behold, Behemoth, which I made as I made you; he eats grass like an ox. Behol..."
794,"Decisions, decisions!What do I like more? Ice cream or donut or eclair? It’s a tough call to make.I love getting down on my knees and performing oral sex just as much as bending over. And that is not to say that I’ve any love lost for spreading my legs either. In fact, in my ideal sex session, I ensure I integrate a little of all to keep it interesting. But if I were forced to choose one, then I’ll choose donut. I mean anal sex.When I was young I was hammered home that anal sex is dirty and bad. When I was in college and was becoming more promiscuous I was told that only dirty girls with lose morals become team anal. When I started dating, a guy was rather surprised when I initiated it just because he seemed rather too infatuated with my derriere.So, why do I like it so much? Perhaps it’s psychological: that it is dirty, that only dirty women do it, that I get to surprise and arouse my partner by willingly guiding him there.Perhaps it’s physical: that I’m in love with the intoxicating pain that comes with inexplicable pleasure; that it has the ability to make me orgasm in just a few strokes; that it makes me embrace the wilder side.Or perhaps, it’s because I just love having anal sex. Simple and clear."

There are frequent breaks in the cold temperatures and it can hit even as high as 60 on some sunny days in the winter. Overall, its really up and down. You can never tell. Although I will say this, get ready for some long spells of cloudy weather. The gloom is sometimes palpable!"

Here's why: The probiotic bacteria in your gut usually convert some of the fiber you can't digest into sugars that you can. There can be more available sugar in a bowl of oat bran cereal than in a bowl of ice cream if you have the right bacteria to digest the fiber. When you have diarrhea, you probably have already lost some of those probiotic bacteria from their ""war"" with other bacteria, and the rest are getting flushed away. You'll lose some calories (it's not a lot) even if you are absorbing all the nutrients from your food in your small intestine. But there's no hard and fast number for this.

801,"Whether you are a morning person or not does not matter when your health is endangered. In order to prevent having health problems both in the young age and old, one needs to practice exercising (walk) in the morning.It is a tough routine, especially due to the fact that we have to do something immediately as we wake up. But once we get into the machine and we start our engines as soon as we wake up, we will start to notice positive consequences reflecting on our lives. Those consequences can have both long-term and short-term effects and here is the list of reasons (and consequences) why you should start exercising the next morning you wake up.10 REASONS WHY MORNING EXERCISES (WALK) ARE CRUCIALLY IMPORTANT FOR YOUR HEALTHYOUR METABOLISM WILL WORK FASTEROnce you start exercising in the morning you will notice one unusual thing about your body – your metabolism. Everyone has a different metabolism – there are people who have naturally slow metabolism and then, there are people who need to boost their metabolism. Therefore, there is not a better way to do the the boosting than to get up in the morning and exercise until you feel that you can start your day.EARLY EXERCISES WILL REDUCE STRESS AND DEPRESSIONScientists have proven that exercises make the body produce endorphin which raises the level of happiness. People who are constantly stressed out or even depressed will reduce significantly their „bad“ states by starting to exercise in the morning. It is important for them to be active as soon as they wake up because then, they will remain positive and relaxed for the rest of the day.YOU WILL GAIN THIS FEELING OF ACCOMPLISHMENT WHEN YOU FINISH YOUR EXERCISEThere are those days when nothing seems to go right and whatever you do does not feel like an accomplishment. However, once you start exercising in the morning, this will be all irrelevant due to the fact that doing a successful exercise morning session is the accomplishment itself. Your subconscious will feel like you achieved something great and you will feel better for the rest of the day.THIS HABIT MAY ATTRACT OTHER HEALTHY HABITSPeople say it takes a month of doing something every day in order for that to become a habit. Living a healthy lifestyle does not only mean exercising every morning but eating healthy as well. Therefore, once you make exercise a habit, you will start feeling so good that you will start thinking about other healthy things such as eating the right food in order to stay healthy.EXERCISING IN THE MORNING BURNS MORE FATThere are certain studies that show that when you exercise in the morning before you have your breakfast you are more likely to lose up to 20% more fat than usually. This is important because if you are striving towards looking good and being in good shape, you will achieve the desired results way faster. If you decided to exercise in the evening, the result simply would not be the same.YOUR ENERGY LEVELS IN THE MORNING WILL BE MUCH HIGHERHuman bodies are built that way to have much more energy to spend right after we wake up and it is solely due to the unhealthy lifestyle that we lead that make us feel drowsy and tired once we wake up. Therefore, once you start exercising and this becomes your routine you will start feeling energy pumping through your body. This means only one thing – that you will have more energy to spend on the exercise itself and make your workout harder and better.THE NATURAL GLOW OF YOUR SKIN WILL APPEARIt is scientifically proven that once you start working out it will have positive effects not only on your metabolism but on your skin as well. People who exercise in the morning are more likely to have a natural skin glow and appear healthier and more beautiful than those who do not work out at all or work out in the evening.YOU WILL BE MORE CONCENTRATED AFTER THE WORKOUTMorning exercise is the best way to become 100% concentrated through the whole day because it kind of works like a cup of coffee that lasts for more than 10 hours. This happens because we put our wake up our bodies and we become ready to tackle the work that we have to do during the day. Once you start exercising regularly in the morning you will notice a significant improve of performance on your job no matter what kind of job you really do.IT’S LESS LIKELY TO BE INTERRUPTEDHonestly, what are the odds of being called or interrupted by someone early in the morning when you prepare to exercise? Pretty minimal, I’d say. On the other hand, if you decide to exercise in the afternoon, there is a huge possibility of someone or something getting in your way – an urgent call from work, your parents visiting you or your girlfriend/boyfriend being suddenly in a desperate need of attention.IMPROVE YOUR SLEEP BY EXERCISING REGULARLYRegular exercise can certainly improve the quality of your sleep and sleep is a crucial part of your health. That’s why you need you will start sleeping always the same amount of hours because you will train your body to follow certain rhythm of sleeping on time and getting up on time to exercise. Furthermore, you will start waking up by yourself and full of energy because you will know that the best part of your day is in the morning.To sum up, it is difficult to start exercising in the morning but you need to be persistent and do it for at least a month before you actually start looking forward to it and before you can have some positive effects. But once you get used to it, the results will be more than amazing. All of the examples listed above will become true and you will generally feel better and you will be able to go out and seize the day.Source: Benefits of Morning Walk"
802,"This question is repeated under karate, Taekwondo and jujitsu and the answer is the same.First of all, you can start a martial art at almost any age and become quite accomplished at it. Age isn't the overriding issue. The issue is understanding what is taught and being able to apply that knowledge. One who reaches black belt at age 50 will have a better understanding than a 9 year old.The question is: What is a “champion?” The word is so over used it becomes meaningless. Understand first, this is not a takeoff on Taekwondo but the issue comes up more because of the prevalence of Taekwondo.It is common that when talking with some one about the martial arts that they know someone who is a national champion in Taekwondo. The instructor in the next town was the “All Korean Champion.” He was the second or third one to hit this particular school. So, they're a “Champion?” Are we talking local, state, national or world champion?A Kyokushin system I know of had it’s “Nationals” each year. Three schools participated. Was the winner a national champion?A well known Taekwondo system required participation and placement in a given number of tournaments before it awarded the title of “All State Champion.”Olympic level Taekwondo or Judo champions I understand. They have a gold medal to prove it. The rest are a mater of semantics. All you have to do is pick the right school. Then, you could become a champion.Seiyo Shorin-ryu Karate & Kobudo - Leach HanshiRon Leach Karate | Facebook"

805,"I have got overall 7.5 bands in IELTS Academic, so my suggestions are based on that level.I am also assuming you know tenses and other grammatical stuff ( I have less problems in this area . It is natural for me . :-))If you want 7.5 bands prepare for 8.Get a practice partner for speaking preparation.Get a reference material. e.g. makkar ielts . It is paid but you can find pdf online for free just by googling it. Make sure that you are reading latest version.Reference material will help you to give reply spontaneously. It will prepare your mind and will compensate for imagination in most part(although you can't answer as per reference line by line, examiner will certainly notice it . Say bye bye to your 8 or 7.5 in speaking if you do this).Don't mug up reference materials, improvise and make it yours.Use Cambridge and IDP materials for reading and listening , can be found on internet for free also. Writing and speaking part may be outdated.Also print your material if possible . I do not suggest digital reading like quora.Take Writing task seriously. It dragged me down to 7.5 .I had to wrap up my graph in 10 minutes. Yes, write essay first and finish it with in 35 to 37 minutes.15 to 17 minutes for graph or table (section 1 ).Use remaining time to check for grammatical and spelling errors. (FYI I was out of time to do this part).Essay book was provided by classes to me and it was makkar, I was not able to find it online . For graph simons is avaliable.Use gerund , passive and connective words.And for listening , practice and patience are necessary.Try to not waste time by applying more than necessary logic. You might also miss answer of following question by thinking about current question ( It happens in mostly MCQ based question to be precise.)Try to train yourself to be alert till last section. Most people tend to relax a bit unconsciously here.Good command on listening and reading are important and essential to improve overall bands.If you have good short-term memory than you have conquered the reading fort.While practicing, I used to finish easy reading within 45 minutes and some real hard from IDP took more than 60 minutes . In my exam I finished reading in 57 minutes. Difficulty level was moderate but it was really long.Remember while practicing you might write T and F. But in exam write TRUE and False, not the short terms.Also write your answers in separate sheet not besides question , if you're using hard copy. Use pencil.I have not mentioned some basic instructions. Do comment if you need in Depth instructions.Thanks for all the upvotes, It really means a lot. I have added few points which also has impact on the result. I did not add this initially because below suggestion might do more harm than good If you do not have enough exposure to cruel world awaiting outside of your comfy homeSo, even after my cliché warning you want to read it, go for it because I still believe in humanity :-).Environment around you is important.If you have joined classes for IELTS , You will find people who are in same boat as you. (At least in India there are small companies who professionally help you to prepare for exam.)This people in classes might become your friends (Rivals) that may boost your moral. You might think you don’t need this kind of motivation, but believe me sky is the limit when it comes to language. This people are important. For instance, some might be trying to go in same country as you, so in short if everything goes smooth you have at least one more familiar face in an unknown country.These friends are very important ,because they can spot your mistakes easily compared to those who are not preparing for IELTS.In classes there are some people who have already given the exam once, you can talk with them and learn about their mistakes.Most people are good but If I were you, I’d take their advice with a pinch of salt (Remember rivalry is not healthy every time).The professional instructors do spot some mistakes that average joe like me can’t identify, simply because I’m not aware that they are mistakes.It is your life . If i were in your shoes, I wouldn’t take any chance with it to just save few bucks.Don’t be a moron and spend large amount on classes that focus on worthless things. You should be able to distinguish the thin line between adequate and exorbitant.It is even better if you have school or college friends preparing with you, because you will be comfortable around them.Some people are afraid to speak in front of crowd(In classes) because they have low self-confidence.So, your friends can help you to boost that confidence a little.I kind of feel I’m repeating my self but still be careful with your friends. Even if one of you is casual (or in pretty words has lack of seriousness) you are better going solo for preparation.You are not going to fight a war, so chill a little. Do remember your future might depend on it.(I know this is out of place here. Respect everyone who has sacrificed their present to make your future. Soldiers on border stay strong, you always have our unconditional love and respect.)You might learn a new prospective on a topic from them. You will understand the importance of prospective when you start your preparation.Do comment if you have any doubts or suggestions. All the best for your exam. Happy Journey..!!Don’t stress your mind before exam. Only practice maximum 2 full LSRW .On the exam day I didn’t do anything new, just went through my notes for 10 to 15 minutes. You might feel hungry during exam so eat something before leaving home.I know it’s silly to write this, ‘use washroom before you enter exam hall and wear nice clothes(must be comfortable as well ) because they will take a photograph of you before exam which will be there in your IELTS certificate’ .Some of you messaged me that you are facing difficulties in writing task. I am not great at writing as well. At that time I had made 3 to 4 different types of generalize formats . For eg. if the topic is about impact of something after it was discovered you can use something like ‘Since the advent of internet….’. So I had this type of 4 to 5 sentence which I can use in 1st paragraph and last paragraph each. I have jot it down in a book but I don’t remember where it is.( I wish I had documented it properly.)Also don’t read old essay too much. It is waste of time. There are some web sites which provide fresh topics asked in exams. Go through those first."

And much of the general programming is not especially mathematical in nature.Visuals/graphic design : little mathematicsAs you might guess this is much more of an artistic exercise and even the implementation of models is not especially mathematical in nature. Caveat: any game where the movement is guided by a physics engine completely throws this assertion out the window. That is highly mathematical, although for that work you’d be better served specifically by a physics degree than a math degree.Core code (structures, servers, execution environments, etc) : somewhat mathematicalThis is the broader code which is more general purpose and follows many of the same design patterns in gaming projects as well as non-gaming projects. I’ve found that there is a certain applicability of mathematical thought processes to code design. Especially to the way mathematicians think about proofs. Repeatability, the knowledge to use others’ previous results, and absolute precision are equally important to programming and writing proofs. However, this is almost a metaphorical link; the thought processes are similar but they’re still distinct skills.AI : intensely mathematicalFor my money, this is probably where a pure math background would be welcome on a software team even with no programming experience. Obviously, both skills are necessary to produce a finished product but designing an intelligent system for a given game is hard. Like really hard and furthermore the more unique the game is the more poorly applying established algorithms to it would work and the drop off for this is very sharp. For genres, think real-time strategy (e.g. Starcraft, Supreme Commander), turn-based strategy (Final Fantasy), turn-based tactics (Final Fantasy Tactics, Fire Emblem, XCom), card-based strategy (Hearthstone, Duels of the Planeswalkers) on the high end of abstraction and strategy. All of these absolutely depend on an AI smart enough to at least somewhat challenge a human player (for non pvp aspects). This is incredibly difficult. Of course there’s plenty of games with basic enemy AI, any rpg (online or not) or shooter for example. These are often (in my experience) much more constrained in terms of intelligence, so while still somewhat challenging, they would not be nearly as deep as my first examples."
808,"Broadly speaking, larceny is non-violent theft and robbery is violent theft. That used to be the fairly standard way of looking at the two until recent times (20th century). Today, the criminal offence of larceny is removed from most countries' laws in favour of a general theft statute, whilst retaining robbery as theft with violence."
809,"Jason here,So, you technically do not need graph theory in order to involve yourself in machine learning, but it is very helpful to know. While whatever machine is learning, graph theory can be helpful in ways of organization for both the machine and yourself. Now, typically, yes, it would be required, but you don’t necessarily need it for everything, you could still preform basic functions without it. Overall, I would suggest that if you plan to participate in things like machine language, algorithm, that you try to at least understand graph theory."

811,"These are the days that try men’s souls, particularly Republican souls.A two-party democracy necessarily implies that each party is a coalition of somewhat disparate groups. The Republican party coalition grew somewhat under Nixon, and a lot more under Reagan, with the addition of Reagan Democrats. These were traditionally Democratic voters who were or felt disrespected and unheard by the Democratic political class, and left behind by the economy.Donald Trump has become a political phenomenon by energizing the 2016 equivalent of that component of the electorate. But he’s done it without considering how to bond this group to the rest of the GOP coalition.His allegiance to GOP platform positions and cultural norms is, at best paper thin and at worst a polite lie. Virtually no one who’s in the GOP coalition because they care about faith, or abortion, or family values, or the 2nd amendment, or deregulation, or taxes, or small government, or the deficit, believes that Donald Trump actually cares about any of these things; they’ve got plenty of evidence that he doesn’t. Nevertheless, they’re hoping that he’ll come down on their side of these issues because he’s making a few of the right noises, or because he’ll appoint conservatives, or just because they’re certain Hillary Clinton will come down on the other side, and they’ve at least got some chance with Trump.Trump, meanwhile is making it hard for them by doing his best to lead his army of the disaffected and assuming the rest of the GOP will have no choice but to join him, and by energizing his army in ways that many of them find troublesome or worse.Meanwhile, in a parallel universe, Ted Cruz is a key leader of a movement of the existing GOP coalition to the right. He’s also interested in remaking the party, but in a totally different way; by shifting the whole coalition while keeping it together. The Cruz movement has been extraordinarily successful at local and state levels, and pretty successful at the congressional level; a Cruz nomination would have been a big milestone for the Tea Party approach, instead, it was sideswiped and rendered temporarily irrelevant by Trump’s march of the disaffected.Big tent parties are used to jostling among the coalition members. The Tea Party, “Movement Conservatives,” Neocons, Acela Republicans, and others all have their ups and downs and internecine warfare. But this internal conflict is different. It’s the first one I know of where the differences are sharp enough, and the leaders, particularly Trump, have so little forbearance, that it’s become a completely open conflict.Whether or not Trump wins the Tea Party Republicans will have a lot of rebuilding to do. If he does win, they’ll have a harder and longer road. So I think if they don’t play the long game and let Trump loose, they’ll find themselves playing an even longer game.As a Democrat, I think it’s a big mistake to look on all this with schadenfreude. Not just because of the bromides about how we need two strong parties to keep democracy healthy, but because Trump (and Sanders too) have proved the existence, by tapping into, so much political voltage. Who are these people? Have we, as parties, really failed them? To what extent are their concerns legitimate? To what extent can government do anything about them?It’s entirely plausible to imagine Donald Trump having run as a Democrat. He would have had a harder time in the Dem primaries, but not a much harder time, and he could possibly have become the nominee. I’m very glad that I’m not the subject of the Republican schadenfreude that would have come with that."
812,"Gross domestic product (GDP) is a monetary measure of the market value of all the final goods and services produced in a period of time, often annually or quarterly. Nominal GDPestimates are commonly used to determine the economic performance of a whole country or region, and to make international comparisons."
813,"The question is larger than that. Others have more or less answered the specific one asked, but even those answers are not completely correct.This stems from concerns about conflict of interest. Federal law makes it illegal for public officials in the executive branch to personally and substantially participate in matters (governmental matters where they have authority or influence) in which they (or their immediate families, business partners or associated organizations) hold financial interests. However, Congress has recognized that this is not feasible for the President, so Congress has exempted the President. This is important because, historically, it means that Congress has long understood, and accepted the fact that Presidents will have assets.In addition, while Federal ethics law generally prohibits officers and employees from personally and substantially participating in matters in which they have a financial interest, there is a disqualification requirement that allows them to recuse themselves. That means they are not required, nor expected to divest their assets or use any other means to shield them from those financial assets. What’s more, those subject to the disqualification requirement is defined to exclude the President and Vice President. So not only are they not required to divest assets, or use a blind trust to remove themselves from participating in their active control, they are also not required to recuse themselves in potential conflicts. They can, but they are not required to.So, there is no current legal or constitutional requirement that would compel the President to relinquish financial interests because of a conflict of interest.Some have done so. Most notably some of the more recent Presidents. But most, however, have not. We think that because we, in our lifetimes, have become used to certain political practices like releasing tax returns, divesting assets, using blind trusts, etc, this is some sort of requirement or it has always been this way. Neither of those is true. Obama, for example did not divest his assets or use a blind trust. In fact, he criticised Romey’s promise to do so on the grounds that a “blind trust isn’t really blind”.The rationale for doing so is purely political. Short of completely selling of one’s assets and burying the proceeds in backyard, one cannot escape the conflict of interest. Non cash assets are “live” the increase and decrease in value based on market forces. The President, and the executive branch have considerable control over the management levers of the economy that a conflict of interest is never avoided.Furthermore, While a lot has been made of the recents President's use of blind trusts, Both the President, and his trustees know full well what those investment are. Even in a qualified blind trust where the investor is not supposed to know what investments are in it, they don’t magically take all existing holdings and convert them into something completely different. Just because a trusted confidant is managing them temporarily does not mean the President has completely forgotten what his or her holdings are. This is merely a vehicle That gives the appearance of having avoided potential corruption. That, of course, I admit is merely a personal observation.It is a generally accepted practice that conflicts of interest do not need to be resolved by divesting or instituting a blind trust anywhere except in the most extreme cases. The principal, most used, and an effective way to deal with a conflict of interest is disclosure. You make public what your interest are so that everyone can evaluate your actions in that light. In fact, using a blind trust may actually be a forensic countermeasure because it lulls everyone into thinking you have eliminated the potential corruption, and they stop watching."

It's a big turn off for girls. Look at her in the eye and speak occasionally. But not very frequently. Bump into her a few times, say Hi, offer help with studies and getting notes and text from seniors.Try to get her phone number now and initially the first week, approach with hesitation and leave texts like good mornings and nights.

815,"Tear or wear in anal opening below the dentate line is fissures. One of the most painful anal disorders that is caused by intense pressure of hard stools, diarrhea, pregnancy or child birth and sometimes caused by trauma. Sometimes it can be a worse conditions than piles and hemorrhoids too.Constipation and passing of hard stools is a result of regular indigestion and acidity. So to cure fissures permanently, you need to treat these causes first otherwise fissure will comeback everytime you treat it. However, we have divided fissures treatment in four stages so that it can be cured permanently and you would get a fissures free life.For the detailed Note on How To Cure Fissures Permanently , for a Fissures free life you can visit the original article here.First Stage TreatmentThis is the instant treatment for the pain and itching associated with it. You need to take some medicine for fissures, like ointments and painkillers fo instant effect. Fissures ointments like GNT (Glycerine Tri Nitrate) ointment have magical effect on fissures.It will heal fissures and will alleviate the burns and itching symptoms. However there are some side effects like dizziness, nausea and minor headaches. So it is recommended to use a pea size amount of the ointment only.For pain, you can use a normol dose of paracetamol or ibuferene.Second Stage TreatmentThe second stage treament involves lowering of pressure on anal opening. This can be done by taking stool softeners and drinking lot of water. Once you will have softer bowel movement, you will see that your constipation has gone and fissures will be cured eventually. Take medicines for diarrhea to lower the harsh effect on anal lining. Avoid anal sex, because that will make the condition even worse.Third Stage TreatmentThird Stage fissures treatment involves treating your indigestion and digestive problems, that had actually caused syptoms of constipation and hard stools. Acidity is one of major reason of indigestion, that irritates stomaches and intestines. You should take antacids to nutrilize the effect of acidity and hear burns.Final Stage TreatmentThe final stage treatment is nothing other than changing your lifestyle. Nurture healthy habits and follow healthy diet full of high fiber foods and avoid unhealthy habits and diet, that's all you have to do for the permanent cure. Avoid sedently lifestyle and excessive sitting and biking to avoid fissures. Similarly avoid junk foods and spicy foods, because these foods triggers fissures irritation and itching. Include yoga like breathing exercises ( Kapalbhatti) and shoulder stand ( Sarvangasana) to counter the effects of fissure and to lower the pressure in anal area. Additionally you can take some ayurvedic patanjali medicines for piles and Fissures like anal problems.So follow these treatments, and do this like a targeted goal to achieve. Your strategic approach will help you cure fissures permanently."
816,"Let me tackle the second part of your question first:What is the correct method to prepare for the GRE verbal?Be careful assuming that the “correct” (maybe I’ll use “best” or “preferred” since there are plenty of good variations of study plans) way to prepare includes the sheer memorization of hundreds of obscure vocabulary words.  On each of the two verbal sections that “count” (you’ll also get a section that’s for research purposes and doesn't count, and that might be verbal or it might be math), you’ll see 10 “vocabulary” questions (typically 6 Text Completion and 4 Sentence Equivalence).  Figure on average you’ll see about six answer choices per problem, meaning that overall on test day you’ll see 120 answer choices that fit “vocabulary.”But go through official practice problems and you should see that most of those words are fairly common, some answer choices (for the multi-blank Text Completions) are phrases and not just vocab words, and of the “not everyone is going to know this word” words, many appear as a single answer choice among other choices that are common words.  Meaning: if one of the words you do know is right, then the one you don’t is wrong, and if the words you do know are all wrong, then this bizarre word is right by process of elimination.So memorizing 1,000 individual words is a long, circuitous route to honing in on the handful of times that you might need to make a decision between two or more “hard” vocab words.Then add these elements:Unless the word came directly from a modern ETS-written GRE problem, it’s just a hard vocabulary word that someone who doesn’t write for the GRE thinks might be a word on the test.  Which also means that it probably comes from an old test, either the old (pre-2011) GRE, which had much more of an emphasis on obscure vocabulary, or the old (pre-2016) SAT, which also emphasized uncommon words.  So most words you memorize won’t appear on your test, and some have a very low (if nonzero at all) probability of showing up there.The modern GRE doesn’t directly test pure word meaning: it’s all about how the word fits into the context of the sentence.  And a good deal of vocab memorization comes out of context, memorizing a dictionary or flashcard definition without really becoming familiar with how that word is used in various situations.And what it really boils down to is this:  remember those commercials for kid cereals (Lucky Charms, Count Chocula, Froot Loops…) that said “part of a healthy, well-balanced breakfast” but then also had a quick shot of all the food you probably should have been eating instead (a banana, maybe some eggs, some fresh fruit…)?  Memorizing some vocabulary is “part of a well-balanced study plan” but it’s not the most important or most valuable part.  You have to know some vocabulary, but your primary score gains will come from learning how to do the problems and reason your way through them.So with all that said, here are some core elements of a quality GRE Verbal study plan:Devour the official ETS-written problems.For one, only ETS really knows which words it will test and which ones it won’t, and any other resource is only making an educated guess.  So make sure you prioritize the official GRE study books, and the official ETS PowerPrep practice tests.  If the authors of the GRE have put it in their resources, it’s a word worth getting to know.But that’s not all!  As you go through the official questions, you’ll get a good feel for how they’re written (I’ll touch on that more a little further down) and what types of action items you’ll need to attack the questions.  This is really important - there’s a definite style and feel to the official problems, and the more you’re in sync with that style the better your study tactics will be directed right at the target.2. Find vocabulary words in context.One huge problem with just sheer flashcard memorization is that you’ll learn some combination of a formal definition and one single usage of that word.  But you’re not directly tested on the meaning of the word: you’re tested on its usage.  So with any word, Google it and then click on “News” and read it as it’s used in a handful of articles.3. Learn words in families.Again, think about how you’ll be tested on these words.  In Sentence Equivalence, your job is to find two words that give the sentence the same, logical meaning.  So learning multiple words that mean the same or similar things (loquacious and garrulous both mean “talkative” or “wordy,” the opposite of succinct) sets you up for questions in which you’ll often need to find pairs.  And with Text Completion, often you’ll see that the sentence requires agreement between two blanks or between one blank and a given word; in these cases, it’s also helpful to know “these words tend to go together.”  So for any “new” word, find a few related, similar words that you already know and think about them together.  And if multiple new words have similar meanings, try to learn them together also.4. Pay attention to roots.Learning words one at a time is pretty inefficient.  So similar to grouping them in families above, picking up on roots that give words similar meanings can help you get more mileage out of each thing you memorize.  Knowing that “mal” is a prefix for “bad” means that even if you don’t know the exact meaning of “malicious” or “malevolent” or “malignant,” you have a pretty good sense that they’re words that mean “bad.”  So if the meaning of the blank has to be “good” you can eliminate those words, and if it’s something negative then unless you see a better fit that you know for sure, you can feel confident picking one of the mal- words.  This website was one of my favorite resources as I was writing up our section on roots in the Veritas Prep lesson book: English Language RootsNow, those are great strategies for learning vocabulary in a GRE-efficient way, but keep in mind that Text Completion and Sentence Equivalence are not explicitly vocabulary exercises!  So as you study, you should also:5. Pay attention to subtle differences between word meanings.This is something that GRE students don’t do nearly enough!  Lots of questions are designed to hinge not on the definition of an obscure word that you’d never use yourself, but on the very precise meanings of words that you use frequently.  I love the problem in this video, for which the whole thing comes down to the difference between “massive” (very big) and “excessive” (too big).  To the untrained or slightly-unfocused (or focused on the wrong thing) they both mean the exact same thing related to “big.”  But the GRE does a great job of requiring (or ruling out) specific meanings and punishing those who take a meaning that’s really close but not exact.6. Think about the second, third, fourth, etc. definitions of a word, not just the most obvious one.Another theme that gets people down is that they quickly make decisions on words based on one definition, without considering some of the lesser-used definitions of those words (cue Led Zeppelin “there’s a sign on the door but she wants to be sure, for you know sometimes words have two meanings…”).  There’s one in an official practice test where just about everyone rules out the word “plastic” - you need a word that means flexible/pliable/malleable - because we all think of plastic material, but then you go through the other answer choices and…maybe one word you’re not exactly sure of but the others don’t really work.  And it’s so, so common…about half of people I see pick the word they don’t know (“well, it isn’t these so it must be that”) and the other half go through a second pass and essentially say “I’d use a different word myself, but yeah I guess plastic does fit here…”One of our instructors called me a couple weeks ago after scoring a perfect 170/170 and as we were debriefing his test, he specifically highlighted that exact takeaway.  He said that much of the test was very comfortable, but on each verbal section at least two problems came down to him having to really dig deep on “wait…but that word that I was about to eliminate actually has several other meanings.” And he specifically called out a strategy we talk about with regard to that “plastic” problem - before you eliminate a word, see if you can change the part of speech.  “Plastic” as an adjective may mean fake, or cheap, or something pertaining to the material plastic.  But “plasticity” as a noun absolutely conjures up the meaning “flexibility/pliability” and helps you realize that “plastic,” via a definition lower on the hierarchy in the dictionary, gives you what you need.7. Be ready to work on these problems.One last limitation to the centrality of vocab memorization is that anything you expressly memorize for conjures up the idea of “hey you either know the meaning or you don’t.”  But so many GRE verbal problems are a lot more about trial and error, plugging in an answer choice or two and seeing if they work together, then going back and trying another combination, and really asking yourself deep down “would anyone really write that sentence?”  Here’s one more video that deals with that topic - any of the problems for which there are multiple answers (Text Completion with more than one blank; Sentence Equivalence where you have to choose two answers) aren’t just an exercise in picking one answer, then moving on and picking the next.  You may find one meaning you love but then have to really critically consider whether you can match it with the other blank or another choice.  And the danger comes from then forcing a square peg in a round hole, so to speak, on that next decision.  GRE Verbal now more than ever really rewards critical thinking - the meaning of the sentence is so crucial but people spend too much of their time memorizing meanings of words.  And as you practice with official problems, you’ll start to learn that lesson and hopefully better focus your preparation on these strategies that will help you master the questions, whether you’ve memorized 1,000 words or even just 100."
817,"Yes and free from religious dogma.? A soul is a spark of conscious energy. There are many varying sizes of souls. There is a soul in your body, the soul of the Sun, the soul of the planets, and well..., everything has soul. Soul is the reason things in the universe started coalescing into life. Soul is the reason nature follows the PHI ratio. If you have ever researched the sound of sacred geometry, you realize wave propagation is what causes life to exist. A sound or a word, but I like to call it frequency. There is clearly intelligent organization to the universe. Who are we to say what is alive, and what is not? What is conscious, and what is not.  When we look at the universe, we see electromagnetic fields everywhere. These electromagnetic fields contain the frequency and information to make life happen. Did you ever wonder why snowflakes all have different patterns, but they're all in a five sided shape? The universe is electromagnetic field within electromagnetic field. There is an electromagnetic field inside the human body that can be detected 10 feet outside the body during the emotion love. We have always thought the heavenly bodies produced the electromagnetic field. I think it is the electromagnetic field that's sweep matter into what we know as reality. Did you know every electromagnetic field takes the shape of a Torah. These fields  spiral out in both directions, from a center, or source. The bigger the electromagnetic field, the more information contained within. It is absolutely impossible for life to randomly come about. There is a sound, that causes everything, form spiral snail shells, to the Fibonacci pattern that spirals out of flowers when they bloom. Scientist have a hard time describing what exactly a field is. When you look at the universe and nature, you see this pattern in everything. The planet hold our magnetic field in, we call it gravity. The Sun holds all the planets in place. The Galaxy hold the Sun in place. The universe holds the galaxy in place, and I have no doubt the universe takes the same torroidial shape. The universe is probably held in place, by what scientists call, the multiverse. This field is present in life. These fields are present in planets. These fields are present in stars. These fields are present in galaxies. It is not a human body, it is a biomechanical quantum supercomputer. The bigger the field, the more information contained within. Field, held within field, infinitely. They can't get a solar system to form  in computer simulations, with gravity the only acting force. Furthermore how did everything haphazardly collide during the early formation of the solar system, with gravity as the only active force, and everything luckily settles on equator line of the Sun. That don't even make sense. There is the force of the wave. The wave is emitted from the field. The people who are sure souls don't exist, are the same people that said, you will never get a heavier than air craft off the ground. What causes the proteins and molecules to arrange in certain patterns, the wave. What causes snowflakes to freeze in a five-sided beautiful geometric pattern, the wave. What they teach us in school, is not the truth. If you want a better understanding, YouTube the sound of sacred geometry. If you want to know why snowflakes take the five Side pattern every time they fall . YouTube The Flower of Life. I was a smug atheist until an episode of the universe was showing solar system formation. They were describing planet hitting planet. Then everything ,  as if by miracle , or grace of God , just settles on the ecliptic plane of our star. Really? If gravity is the only acting force as we were taught in school, shouldn't we all hazardly orbit the Sun? That's an explanation, by our scientists, not a very realistic one. Some people when offered the easiest explanation,  just go with it, No research. As long as the person telling has some kind of indoctrinated teaching, most people accept it. If you think of space as a calm pool of water. Then think of the Sun as a giant pebble, dropped into that calm water. The waves would be tight at the epicenter, then get wider and wider the further they got from the source of the wave. Look at the size of the planets in our solar system. They are really small close to the Sun, As the wave gets wider more, and more, debri migrates to the lower part of the wave. That is why the planet sizes are small close to the Sun, and the further you get out, the bigger the planets get. Of course this could all be a coincidence, but at least I am NOT accepting the easiest answer given, or dening truth's, in defence my own way of thinking. It isn't science vs religion. It is simply divide and conquer. It makes it easier to control us. It is called common sense, because we look at the commonalities, and try to make sense of them."

819,"“Thanks for A to A”.Pollution is even deadlier than war, disaster and hunger.It can be categorized under various types; Air, Water, Noise, Soil, Radioactive, Light etc. I would like to talk specifically about Air Pollution and measures to be taken by the People and the Government in particular. There are various causes and solutions to air pollution in India also there are various stakeholders involved. Let’s look out how two of them can make a significant impact.1- WE, the Mango People-1. Drive an electric or hybrid car or at least one that uses unleaded petrol, keep our car in good running condition to avoid emissions, Share a ride/carpool, use public transportation system, or choose to walk/ride a bicycle whenever possible.2. Never use open fires to dispose of waste, especially chemicals and plastic.3. Adopt the golden 3 R’s of solid waste management: Reduce, Reuse, and Recycle.4. Conserve Energy by using energy efficient appliances and Harness the renewable sources of power for Eg: Wind and Sun.5. Buy local foods and goods wherever possible. In this manner, the use of fuel for transporting goods can be minimized.6. Avoid plastics, always bring a bag when you shop. Use and buy products that are eco-friendly or made with biodegradable materials.7. Plant more trees. They clean the air, provide oxygen, and beautify your surroundings.8. Do not litter. Start an anti-litter campaign to educate your community. Education is Power.2- How can Big Boss be helpful-1. Promotion of public transport network of metro, buses, e-rickshaws and promotion of car pooling, lane discipline, vehicle maintenance etc. It would be awesome to provide free/cheaper modes of public transportation.2. Strict and comprehensive implementation of Laws/Rules such as The Forest Conservation Act, 1980, Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981, EPA 1986 etc.3. Gasification to avoid burning of crop residue (straw and stubble burning in Punjab, Haryana, UP).4. Scrapping of CAMPA (Compensatory Afforestation Fund Management and Planning Authority) and strict protection of forests. (this point may have some divergent opinions)5. Proper pavement of roads, Vacuuming of road dust.6. Rights based Forest Management.7. Urban Forestry.8. Introduction of cleaner/alternate fuels like gaseous fuel (CNG, LPG etc.), ethanol blend etc.9. Taxing polluting vehicles and incentivising hybrid and electric vehicles.10. Installation of on-line continuous (24x7) monitoring devices by major industries.Some of the steps are already taken by govt such as -Implementation of BS-IV norms in 63 selected cities and universalisation by 2017. Decision to leapfrog directly from BS-IV to BS-VI fuel standards by 1st April, 2020.Setting up of monitoring network for assessment of ambient air quality.Though this is not the comprehensive answer to the big-big problem of pollution but I am pretty sure that the above mentioned steps, if applied will definitely have a significant impact.“One person alone cannot save the planet’s biodiversity, but each individual’s effort to encourage nature’s wealth must not be underestimated.— United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP)”cheers :)"

821,"AB 1729…was promoted as a way to give schools more flexible tools in dealing with habitually defiant students. It was followed up with AB 420 which pretty much banned expulsion for defiance.In reality, there were no new tools for dealing with defiant behavior. Teachers just have to absorb a lot more defiance, disrespect and abuse from students. They also had to jump through more hoops before we can use the old tools. It also means that the defiance has to escalate to even worse behaviors before the student faces consequences.A couple years ago I had a student who was habitually defiant and seemed to pepper every conversation with at least a few F-words and Sh-words. Instead of asking for a bathroom pass he’d come up and say, “I gotta take a shit.” But even worse, he would refuse to work as he preferred that someone give him answers. And if I wouldn’t give him answers, he would wander the room trying to cheat off of others right in front of me. Despite his habitual defiance, this student was never suspended for defiance. It was only after he threatened to “kick the ass” of a substitute teacher or “beat the ass” of an autistic student did he face any real consequences. By the end of the semester, it was a constant struggle to keep him from disrupting class full time.And if you’re getting a mental picture of a black or Hispanic street tough, think again. This was a self entitled white kid with expensive clothes who made a point of talking ghetto. So I also had to see this every day and he defiantly refused to pull his pants up.Now I haven’t gotten to the worst part. The laws are so broadly written that they make it hard to discipline students for things other than defiance.One memorable student broke into one of the biology labs and stole 2 digital scales. When they caught him, he had the scales in his backpack along with a book on how to grow and sell marijuana. Administration didn’t think they could suspend this student for stealing valuable and expensive lab equipment because his parents had not been previously contact for stealing scales. Yes it’s that absurd.That student would eventually be transferred into my class because he was defiant and abusive to a female teacher. They couldn’t stop the behavior, so they moved him into my class. I’m a 6′2″, 250lb martial artist so they figured that if his behavior escalated, it was safer to have him in my class.The lack of discipline taught this student an important but dangerous message, that he could get away with doing what ever he wanted. Shortly after graduation, he made the local news for a one-day crime spree that included multiple instances of purse snatching.The worst thing about AB 1729 and AB 420 is the harm it’s doing to kids. I’m not talking about the kids who come to school to learn. Yes it’s hurting them. But the kids these laws are hurting most is the kids with behavior problems. I grew up fatherless and in unstable circumstances. I had lots of bad influences and acted out. I was a discipline problem. But I was sent to a Catholic school for 3 years and the teachers there used assertive discipline to mold me into a productive member of society. So Instead of snatching purses from little old ladies, I’m a professional with 2 masters degrees.Letting kids get away with defiance is not helping them, it’s hurting them."

825,"Everyone thinks I exaggerate when I tell them this story, but hey, this happened, you believe it or not.I was standing at Trivandrum Central railway station waiting for my train to Mumbai. I had just arrived there from Nagercoil via another passenger train.As I stood there looking around aimlessly, I took a look at the pile of luggage lying next to me. It was mine. There was a sack full of coconuts (because Keralites eat, drink, sleep and live coconuts) and a carton filled with Kerala specialty snacks and another carton that had a jackfruit that weighed at least ten kilograms (yes, we kinda like jackfruits too).I notice that I have a piece of luggage missing.Oh. that’s my backpack. Surely, it’s on my back………. SHIT. It’s not.I feel salt water filling my mouth. I look around. My backpack is nowhere to be seen. I count my luggage. I had five units in total. Yes, there were only four now. I feel my shoulders again and no, there is nothing hanging there. Then I remember the contents of the bag.Food. Okay, not that big of a loss. Manageable.My Kindle. That shit cost me like 10,000 bucks.*Wipes sweat from the brow*My laptop. Cost me 35,000 bucks but more than the money, it contained invaluable things including a full year of lab work; all my experiments, results, graphs, projections. My stomach begins to churn.Finally, I turn to my uncle who had come to see me off and tell him I might have a bag missing. He asks me the contents and I tell him. He looks like he wants to slap me because of course, I deserve to be slapped.We conclude that I might have left it in the passenger train that we had used to come to Trivandrum from Nagercoil. That was over 20 minutes ago. I run into the station master’s office and tell him my story and ask him where the train is now. He tells me it has been sent to the yard at Kochuveli station which is exactly 8 kilometers away. And it’s a desolate place filled with rag pickers who scavenge through the countless trains that arrive there each day. If I started now, maybe I could recover my bag back, said the station master, “But I wouldn’t bet on it,” were his final words.Now, I had a problem. My train was to arrive in less than 10 minutes and so me going there was out of the question. So, my uncle says he will, and leaves immediately.As soon as my uncle left the station, he wanted to catch an auto, but unsurprisingly no one wants to go and those who will, are in line, so that will take some time, which he does not have.Seeing him look for an auto desperately, an RPF constable asks him what the problem is and he tells him. Well, guess what? That dude brings out his bike and offers to take my uncle to Kochuveli. He was about to travel there for his next shift anyway he said, so why not go a bit earlier. Bless his soul.My train had arrived and I was sitting inside knowing full well that I would have to go home without the bag and hear my father expound upon being a man and taking responsibility in life.Meanwhile, my uncle reaches Kochuveli and the constable takes him to the RPF police station there. They listen to him and send two other constables with him to go bag hunting. They walk through the knee-high grass and empty rakes on all sides and finally find the train. They get in and start combing through the compartments one by one.I get a call. It says “Fazal Mama”. I know it’s bad news. They never found it. Some ragpicker had had a lucky day. He had stumbled on 40k worth of gadgets and some nice idlis and chicken biryanis for his family.I receive the call.“What was in your bag?”“Huh?”“I asked you what was in your bag?”“Umm.. Food..”“No, just the expensive stuff.”“A laptop and a Kindle.”“How much do they cost approximately?”“I don’t know, around 40k?”“Okay.”I waited for a few seconds. He was doing something on the other end. Then he spoke again.“We found your bag. Everything’s in it. I was filling out a form ..."

829,"As a BME major, I have to take the following types of courses(yes, I checked several universities to ensure these are common)The basic intro engineering load all universities require of all their engineering majors - calculus, multivariable calculus, and differential equations for math, and at least one semester of general chemistry and calculus based mechanics and electromagnetism for science, as well as a semester of computer science for scientific computing later. My university then adds linear algebra to the math requirement(and I think statistics), and requires an “ENGRI”, a freshman level science/engineering class in some more specialized thing (stuff like nanotechnology, intro MechE/ChemE/BME, and Lasers/Photonics, for example). BME also required intro cell biology or physiology and a bio lab - some intro bio is absolutely unavoidable.Physiology. Yeah, you're unlikely to get away with just intro biology, you're going to have to do more than that. I personally am doing a “physiology of health and disease” class now, and will do a “electrical and chemical physiology” class later. That will be three physiology classes by graduation, since I did intro physiology for the intro bio. Admittedly, my university is a bit insane, but you will probably end up doing at least some physiology specifically. After all, physiology literally is the study of how the body works- wouldn't it be insane to engineer something that you don't understand how it works? BME without physiology is like not knowing how an engine works but wanting to engineer a better engine - completely nonsensical. So yeah, physiology is going to be there.Statics, a classic mechanical engineering course. It's not necessarily normal to take specifically the same statics as MechEs as I did(I'm actually required to specifically do this in my university, though), but I believe I see some sort of advanced mechanics above the freshman level for all the other BME curriculums I looked at. You're expected to wear a little of a MechE hat as a BME.Circuits/signals/imaging/instrumentation. This is a bit less standardized, but all are sort of important to a BME. In my case, I'm currently taking a “biomedical signals” course that does things like figure out how to recover a blood oxygen level from the light signals of a pulse oximeter - signal processing here, and that's an electrical engineering topic. Later I'll take a “biomedical instrumentation” class that has to do with things like sensors and measurements - one of the projects is analyzing the way people walk - I imagine this goes slightly back to the signals class. Your exact depth into this may well depend on the exact university you attend, but I believe some level of introduction to these things are pretty universal. After all, some sort of ability to gather/analyze real biomedical data is really fundamental to be able to pretty much do anything useful like a new drug or device. Of course, you can even concentrate in this.Fluid mechanics/mass transfer/anything chemE, really. In my case, we combined much of this in a “biomedical transport phenomena” class. We covered fluid mechanics, a little chemical kinetics, and mass transfer, in biological scenarios like flow through an artery, receptor ligand binding, tissue oxygenation, and drug delivery/pharmacokinetics. We also do some chemical thermodynamics in a “biomolecular thermodynamics” class. If you walk away with a BME degree without knowing any of that, I would be seriously shocked - you just can't do BME without this chemE hat. You need it to kind of get how the body works at a lower level - even if chemE stuff can make you want to cry at times.Engineering modeling of physiology. (Yes, I, and biomedical engineering departments, consider this distinct from the physiology itself) This is sort of covered in something like my transport course I described above, but the point is that you will universally need to know how to model biological processes. This is covered by a smattering of everything else and a “engineering analysis of metabolic and structural systems” senior year class.A materials course of some kind. “Biomaterials” in my case, you care about materials a decent bit as a BME. The moment you want something in the body, you have to consider things like whether the material both has the needed mechanical and electrical properties, but also how it may chemically react with the body.Like any true engineering major, a senior design project.You can see that's really broad. As such, electives are pretty much exclusively used to further concentrate on a specific subset of BME. For exampleI'm interested in tissue engineering or drug delivery. So I'd delve deeper into chemical engineering concepts, particularly for drug delivery. I need to know more stuff on the mass transfer behind drug delivery, for example. Incidentally, that's also important to understand issues like inadequate tissue perfusion in tissue engineering. I may also try to take some more biology if I go to tissue engineering.A BME friend wants to do instrumentation. So he'd focus on understanding sensors and data collection better than the one instrumentation class he got. Maybe even electrical engineering classes for the most relevant bits.Those interested in biomechanics may take even further mechanics than statics and its equivalent. I'm talking soft tissue mechanics classes and dynamics/other traditional MechE classes.Yeah, that's the thing. It's such a broad field I needed this long of an answer to address everything."

832,"Many autoimmune disorders cause muscle and joint pain â€” which can interfere with sleep. Your immune system may attack cells involved in sleep processes. Researchers recently determined that narcolepsy, a condition in which people fall asleep suddenly and without intention, is an autoimmune disorder.Watch this for more possible causes:If you’re struggling with Insomnia long term then Insomnia TV has some great videos and a free download for a 14 sleep makeover which is perfect for sticking on when you’re trying to sleep: (Full Free Audiobook 14 Day Sleep Makeover) Sleep Smarter: 21 Essential Strategies to SleepWhat keeps you up at night? Pondering deep questions? Excitement about a big trip? Or is it stress about unfinished work, an upcoming test, or a dreaded family gathering? For many people, this stress is temporary, as its cause is quickly resolved. But what if the very thing keeping you awake was stress about losing sleep? This seemingly unsolvable loop is at the heart of insomnia, the world’s most common sleep disorder. Almost anything can cause the occasional restless night a snoring partner, physical pain, or emotional distress.And extreme sleep deprivation like jetlag can throw off your biological clock, wreaking havoc on your sleep schedule. But in most cases, sleep deprivation is short term. Eventually, exhaustion catches up with all of us. However, some long term conditions like respiratory disorders, gastrointestinal problems, and many others can overpower fatigue. And as sleepless nights pile up, the bedroom can start to carry associations of restless nights wracked with anxiety.Come bedtime, insomniacs are stressed. So stressed their brains hijack the stress response system, flooding the body with fight flight or freeze chemicals. Cortisol and adrenocorticotropic hormones course through the bloodstream, increasing heart rate and blood pressure, and jolting the body into hyperarousal. In this condition, the brain is hunting for potential threats, making it impossible to ignore any slight discomfort or nighttime noise. And when insomniacs finally do fall asleep, the quality of their rest is compromised.Our brain’s primary source of energy is cerebral glucose, and in healthy sleep, our metabolism slows to conserve this glucose for waking hours. But PET studies show the adrenaline that prevents sleep for insomniacs also speeds up their metabolisms. While they sleep, their bodies are working overtime, burning through the brain’s supply of energy giving glucose. This symptom of poor sleep leaves insomniacs waking in a state of exhaustion, confusion, and stress, which starts the process all over again.When these cycles of stress and restlessness last several months, they’re diagnosed as chronic insomnia. And while insomnia rarely leads to death, its chemical mechanisms are similar to anxiety attacks found in those experiencing depression and anxiety. So suffering from any one of these conditions increases your risk of experiencing the other two. Fortunately, there are ways to break the cycle of sleeplessness.Managing the stress that leads to hyperarousal is one of our best understood treatments for insomnia, and good sleep practices can help rebuild your relationship with bedtime. Make sure your bedroom is dark and comfortably cool to minimize “threats” during hyperarousal. Only use your bed for sleeping, and if you’re restless, leave the room and tire yourself out with relaxing activities like reading, meditating, or journaling. Regulate your metabolism by setting consistent resting and waking times to help orient your body’s biological clock.This clock, or circadian rhythm, is also sensitive to light, so avoid bright lights at night to help tell your body that it’s time for sleep. In addition to these practices, some doctors prescribe medication to aid sleep, but there aren’t reliable medications that help in all cases. And over the counter sleeping pills can be highly addictive, leading to withdrawal that worsens symptoms. But before seeking any treatment, make sure your sleeplessness is actually due to insomnia.Approximately 8% of patients diagnosed with chronic insomnia are actually suffering from a less common genetic problem called delayed sleep phase disorder, or DSPD. People with DSPD have a circadian rhythm significantly longer than 24 hours, putting their sleeping habits out of sync with traditional sleeping hours. So while they have difficulty falling asleep at a typical bedtime, it’s not due to increased stress. And given the opportunity, they can sleep comfortably on their own delayed schedule.Our sleeping and waking cycle is a delicate balance, and one that’s vital to maintain for our physical and mental wellbeing. For all these reasons, it’s worth putting in some time and effort to sustain a stable bedtime routine, but try not to lose any sleep over it…"

834,"Foremost thing that matters in clearing any competitive exam is the approach and direction. This is further dependent on the Faculty, Study Material, Mentoring and other important factors.Many of us get into some institutes where a lot of students have already given there attempts 3–4 times or batch strength is more than 30. A beginner can never understand and start from the concepts in these kind of classes. Also, some institutes hire inexperienced faculty and do injustice to their students.I would suggest look for an institute where initially you can attend free demo classes(more than 1), Study material should be updated, faculty who is expert in their subjects like Quant, LR, GS or English, and provide updated testing environment.I have a keen interest in guiding aspirants for govt. jobs and other fields too. I researched about various institutions in Chandigarh by visiting and attending demo classes. I found some are really good in teaching but batch sizes are 30+, some have good material and testing but faculty is inexperienced.There was one institute in Sector 34-A named “My Career”. They have started the institute afresh in Chandigarh although have quite well-reputed center in Bathinda (as some sources told me from the city). Main benefit is it is run by IIM Alumni and very experienced faculty who have actually taught students for MBA. Study material is also fine. Major plus point here would be that they have started in the city, so they are really working hard to give good results and provide good coaching & training to students and hence excel in the league. So, after all research and counsel, I would recommend My Career Institute to all for SSC and Banking Coaching. You guys can atleast visit and attend demo classes there. All the Best !! :)"

837,"By using an effective app !!Yes, because using a same old alarm clock is too mainstream :DAfter watching so many YouTube videos on how to wake up early in the morning did not really work for me . Because I was a “Sleepaholic” I should say but I used to awake till late night. Each and everyday, each and every night I use to promise myself saying that tomorrow I will wake up early in the morning even during exams !. But that “Tomorrow” never used to come. With all my force and effort I used to wake up sometimes but the gravitational force was so high that every time I used to lose the battle against it.I was not a morning person at all. So I have decided to do something for it. Finally I installed an app called “Alarmy (Sleep if You can)”Attention you Sleepyhead !!This is pretty well organised.Say you set an alarm at 5 in the morning and there are ways to dismiss the alarm in the morning. It will ask some maths problems or it will ask you to shake your phone 100 times! or it will ask you to scan bar code or it will ask you to take photo and match with particular photo with which you have already taken previously !!. You can change any method of turning off the alarm here. Trust me it worked really for me.If you are smart enough to switch off the phone while buzzing it can automatically restart and again starts buzzing .If you want to uninstall it can’t be uninstalled until and unless “Prevent app uninstall” is turned on.In fact, there are lot of apps available in the market you can download any of such apps which you found it very useful.This is the screenshot of my history showing that how many times in a month I woke up on time.Pretty much useful isn’t it?Not only an app helps in waking up early but also a self motivation towards it does !!"

841,"Increasing your credit score by 100 points is not rocket science,i am going to list a few things you can do by improving your credit score and if time is a factor this will get your credit up in 30 days. Sit back and1. Correct any errors on the credit report :Contact creditors that are reporting inaccurate late payments or defaults. Call them by phone and ask to rectify the mistakes. Then follow up with a letter making the same request and notify all three credit reporting bureaus of the pending changes.Make sure creditors know the bureaus have been notified. It may motivate them to act quickly.2. Raise your available credit :Requesting a higher credit limit from an already-established creditor may also help boost the borrower’s available credit line. This in turn could help elevate a credit score.3. Negotiate :A defaulted credit card bill can leave a serious blemish on a credit report. However, it does not have to remain there forever. Consumers can ask creditors to accept partial payment for a debt in collections in return for reclassifying the debt as “paid.” A creditor may agree to settle for a partial payment, or they may make a counter offer.4. Hire a professonal :This to me is the best method, it not only saves you the stress,dedication and partial frustation that comes with improving your credit score but you can also improve your credit score points from 100 points to 500 points at once. It is advised that when hiring a professional you should seek a profound and experienced one like myself to avoid any future catastrophe."

He can't be killed, and he is the one who chooses who gains entry into the Hall of Valor in Sovngarde.In gameplay, it's this guy:That's right, Master Arngeir. He might not be who you thought of, right? Well, for starters, he is tied with Miraak for being the highest level NPC at level 150. Furthermore, he knows every shout in the game except for Dragonrend and Miraak’s Four word shout. He doesn't use them all, but even then he is near impossible to kill. He has 1292 health(for perspective, Alduin has over 2000 at all levels), and over 1000 stamina, though he doesn't need the green bar. If you fight him at High Hrothgar, you're done. He can use Ice Form and freeze you, and one of his pals will probably use Unrelenting Force and knock you off the edge.If you fight him elsewhere, he can do the same thing, just without assistance."
844,"The technical answer is, yes. You are two humans who might make the decision to date each other.The legal answer is, it depends on where you are having the relationship, and whether the laws of that region allow it.The religious answer is, Islam does not condone a romantic relationship between a boy and a girl unless they are husband and wife. However, it depends on how religious he is, as there are moderate Muslims in unmarried relationships of varying degrees of intimacy. The important thing is that you are honest to each other, understand what feels right to each other about the situation, and mutually respect each other's wishes/responsibilities.The societal answer is, it depends on his family, as well as which society your relationship would take place in. If his family's not cool with it because of your different religions, I'd say it's best to keep out and avoid disrespecting them, because as a fellow East Asian I know we don't tend to be big on religion, so you might not enjoy this struggle.Not all Muslims are the same, and your love could be impossible, or it could blossom to the point where you adopt his culture and religion or he might adopt yours.

847,"Easiest, for me, is to use the theorem from advanced calculus, derived by Fourier about 100 years before Heisenberg did his work.  He showed that a superposition of waves could not have both a small size and also a small number of frequencies.  Specifically, he showed that Δ𝑘Δ𝑥≥1/2ΔkΔx≥1/2\Delta k \Delta x \ge 1/2In this equation, k is the ""wavenumber"", or the ""spatial frequency"", equal to 2π/wavelength. I emphasize that this equation is only based on the mathematics of Fourier transforms.  It has nothing to do with quantum mechanics.Now recognize that for the wave function, the momentum of the particle is given by p = (h/2π)k.  So take the Fourier equation, multiply both sides by (h/2π), and you getΔ𝑝Δ𝑥≥ℎ/4πΔpΔx≥h/4π\Delta p \Delta x \ge h/4πSince the wave function is a wave, this equation is an immediate consequence.  This is Heisenberg's uncertainty relationship. Because it is quantum physics, we no longer interpret Δ𝑝Δp\Delta p as a range of spatial frequencies, but as an uncertainty.  That's because the standard (""Copenhagen"") interpretation of quantum mechanics says that a measurement will detect only one of the many waves that compose the pulse. This derivation is not an approximation or a heuristic argument, but a correct derivation, and as a result it gives the exact Heisenberg relationship.  Of course, in order to understand it, you have to understand the properties of waves, and that was worked out by Fourier.  There are other ""heuristic"" ways to see the relationship.  Some of these refer to the fact that measurement ""must disturb"" the particle.  In fact, the only assumption that you need to make in modern quantum physics is that a measurement causes the wave function to ""collapse"", meaning that only one of its many components will be detected."
848,"Hi,The International English Language Testing System (IELTS) measures the language proficiency of people who want to study or work where English is used as a language of communication. It uses a nine-band scale to clearly identify levels of proficiency, from non-user (band score 1) through to expert (band score 9).IELTS Academic or IELTS General TrainingIELTS is available in two test versions: Academic - for people applying for higher education or professional registration, and General Training for those migrating to Australia, Canada and the UK, or applying for secondary education, training programmes and work experience in an English-speaking environment. Both versions provide a valid and accurate assessment of the four language skills: listening, reading, writing and speaking.Test formatTwo formats of IELTS test are avialable –a) IELTS AcademicThe Academic module is designed for candidates who seek to acquire education at undergraduate or postgraduate levels, and for those who want to go abroad for professional registration.b) IELTS GeneralThe General Training format is for those who wish to migrate to English-speaking countries for secondary education, work experience or training programs. People migrating to Australia, Canada and New Zealand must take the General Training test.Note: certain professions require an Academic test result for registration and migration purposes.Each recognizing organization sets its own entry requirements. In some cases both modules may be accepted. One must contact the organization you are applying to in order to check their requirements.Both modules cover all four language skills listening, reading, writing and speaking.Everyone takes the same Listening and Speaking tests.There are different Reading and Writing tests for the Academic and General Training modules.The Listening, Reading and Writing tests must be completed on the same day. There are no breaks between the three written tests.The Speaking test may be taken up to seven days before or after the test.When can I take IELTS?IELTS is available on 48 fixed dates a year – up to four times a month,depending on local demand. Check all the test dates for the year or go to your nearest centre to see its next test date.StructureIELTS has two versions of tests, namely –AcademicGeneralboth the versions have 4 sections : Reading, Writing, Speaking & Listening. The Speaking & Listening sections remains the same in both the versions, but the Reading & Writings sections of the Academic version are slightly tougher than the similar sections in General version of the test.All candidates must complete four Modules – Listening, Reading, Writing and Speaking to obtain an IELTS Test Report Form. The Listening, Reading and Writing modules must be completed in one day. The Speaking module may be taken, at the discretion of the test centre, in the period seven days before or after the other modules.The typical structure of IELTS test is :-Listening (30 minutes)Timing: Approximately 30 minutes (plus 10 minutes’ transfer time)Questions: 40Test Parts: 4 sectionsSection 1 is a conversation between two people set in an everyday social contextSection 2 is a monologue set in an everyday social context (e.g. a speech about local facilities or a talk about the arrangements for meals during a conference)Section 3 is a conversation between up to four people set in an educational or training context (e.g. a university tutor and a student discussing an assignment, or a group of students planning a research project)Section 4 is a monologue on an academic subject (e.g. a university lecture)Each section is heard once onlyA variety of voices and native-speaker accents is used.Skills assessed: The listening section assesses a variety of skills which enables the judgement of the candidate on grounds of their understanding of the basic factual information delivered b..."
849,"With ease as losing weight has zero to do with exercise. It’s all about nutrition.Firstly here is what not to do!Follow any advice that suggests consuming less calories than you burn. Although this sounds logical it ignores how the body works and sadly ignores every meaningful, large study over years.The very best study ever done on caloric reduction as a path to lasting weight loss showed that it failed. The Women’s Health Initiative, a gigantic randomized controlled trial,followed almost 50,000 womenover seven and a half years.One group of the women followed a low-fat, low-calorie diet high in grains, fruits, and vegetables and reduced their total daily calories by 361 calories. They also increased their amount of exercise by 14 percent.The other group followed their usual diet.The first group was expected to show weight loss. The other group was not expected to see any weight loss.The final results were a complete shock to everybody involved.The actual difference in weight loss between the two groups was not even two pounds!Worse still, the average waist size in the low-calorie, increased-exercise group grew from 35 to 35.4 inches. These 25,000 women who so carefully followed the “eat less, move more” strategy for so long actually ended up fatter than ever. Source :Dr Jason FungSuper hard workouts or intense cardio type suggestions! Don’t follow for weightlossworking out is for fitness, function and health.The most famous study on exercise followed 13,000 runners over decades. Complied by RUNNERS WORLD, these runners were highly active. The results of miles and miles of running? All 13,000 were fatter after every decade!(I have plenty of big studies that prove both, again please don’t quote back small studies, with selected people, over short durations; they don’t stand up to scrutiny)So if;eating less moving more is not the answer,calorie deficit is not the answer,insane amounts of cardio is not the answer.WHAT IS THE ANSWER?When I say not the answer, I mean long term, permanent weightloss. Please don’t quote studies that have less than 100 people, over less than a year. They are meaningless studies and often funded by food or drink companies.So to get rid of fat; it’s all down to understanding one thing.How the body stores or burns fat.This process is controlled by two hormones (insulin and glucagon) that work like scales. Too much insulin and you’ll store fat, no insulin and glucagon can do it’s job and burn fat.The proof that hormones control fat storing and burning is common knowledge in the medical world and is not controversial. Yes there are hormones that control hunger and feeling full but in the end it’s all about being a fat burner or sugar burner.Don’t eat refined carbohydrates, sugars and fructoseYes without a doubt that’s all you need to do. It’s the most natural way the body works.The Ketogenic diet works this way.High fat, low carb works this way andIntermittent fasting (eating nothing for at least 16 hours per day every week or so) works this way.They lower insulin levels and raise glucagon levels.Those that say it’s unhealthy to try ketogenic, intermittent fasting or low carb diets seem to be promoting the current western diet that gives you a 1–3 chance of either high blood pressure, obesity or diabetes. So I think we can assume that the ‘normal’ way to eat is actually not that healthy! Anyway I digress…This problem of raising insulin also explains why eating little and often is making fat loss slow or impossibleYou do not need 6 small meals a day, it’s ridiculous to think humankind in 140,000 years of existence has made the NEED for this CONSTANT feeding part of our day to day functioning.Our body’s need only 2 meals a day, 3 tops. We can actually go days without food. The longest fast on record is 382 days. Here are two graphs that illustrate why eat little and often is not a good methodHERE ARE EXAMPL..."
850,"Since I got into digital 10 years ago I have been a fan of compacts, for lots of reasons, but one thing I really like is being able to turn off all sounds, including the “shutter.” Compacts (so far as I know) don't actually have shutters; they expose the sensor electronically, which is why your live view blanks out for the fraction of a second that the “shutter” is “firing.” My latest camera is an upgrade from a Nikon P7800. I bought a gently used Sony RX-10 and I am nuts about it. One reason why is, like my previous compacts, I can shut off all sounds; no beeps, no clicks, no nuthin'. Stealth shooting. I love to shoot in museums but I don't like to attract attention (just shy). No shutter sound lets me work quietly making natural family candids. The whoooosh-thunk of a DSLR mirror and shutter are real attention getters, exactly what I don't want. I find that with the camera mashed to my face I can still hear a little whisper click when it “fires,” and of course the electronic viewfinder blacks out. There's no reason to worry that you can't tell if it's firing.I got the .pdf of the RX-100 III and found on page 27, in the setup menu, a reference to audio signals, setting the operating sounds. That should be where you can go in and turn off all the sounds, including the “shutter.”"

I don’t even have to lock my stuff up cause nobody would even try steal anything.I just started dating a VP of a gang and I know theirs the typical guy stuff with the way he acts but as far as how gang life will affect your relationship,He is always busy, always walking out the door even though he doesn’t have a 9–5. You need to be ok with his business coming first. I don’t even want to know what he does so I don’t ask at all because it comes with the territory.Learn to keep busy because you will be alone a lot.Always dress nice for him, men like that love to show off their girl you always have to be extra and they don’t mind paying for it.He will always have girls trying to get at him and they love the attention. Females know they have money so they will be hitting him up all the time, you need to be so straight up it ain’t funny. First time I met him I told him if it’s me it’s no one else, and I just ask him straight out who she, who’s that don’t sit around but and assume shit or you will get nowhere with them BUT reign it in don’t throw some massive fit just let them know you don’t like it and they better cut that bitch off then drop it.He has a lot of money so you never pay for much besides little things that you want.His ex will never be out of his life if they have children. I made sure to let him know that I know my place with the ex and don’t involve yourself at all with that problem unless she’s trying to get at him. They have a weird sense of loyalty when it comes to the mother of their children.You need to love his children like your own from day 1. No questions asked.You feel safer than you ever will in your life even though you’re probably in more danger to a certain extent.Expect to be judged by everyone.I would never be with just a nobody in a gang (shallow I know) the benefits have to outweigh the bad or it’s pointless."
852,"I believe Captain Blackadder put it best.Baldrick: The thing is: The way I see it, these days there's a war on, right? and, ages ago, there wasn't a war on, right? So, there must have been a moment when there not being a war on went away, right? and there being a war on came along. So, what I want to know is: How did we get from the one case of affairs to the other case of affairs?Edmund: Do you mean ""Why did the war start?""Baldrick: Yeah.George: The war started because of the vile Hun and his villainous empire-building.Edmund: George, the British Empire at present covers a quarter of the globe, while the German Empire consists of a small sausage factory in Tanganyika. I hardly think that we can be entirely absolved of blame on the imperialistic front.George: Oh, no, sir, absolutely not. [aside, to Baldick] Mad as a bicycle!Baldrick: I heard that it started when a bloke called Archie Duke shot an ostrich 'cause he was hungry.Edmund: I think you mean it started when the Archduke of Austro-Hungary got shot.Baldrick: Nah, there was definitely an ostrich involved, sir.Edmund: Well, possibly. But the real reason for the whole thing was that it was too much effort not to have a war.George: By Golly, this is interesting; I always loved history...Edmund: You see, Baldrick, in order to prevent war in Europe, two superblocs developed: us, the French and the Russians on one side, and the Germans and Austro-Hungary on the other. The idea was to have two vast opposing armies, each acting as the other's deterrent. That way there could never be a war.Baldrick: But this is a sort of a war, isn't it, sir?Edmund: Yes, that's right. You see, there was a tiny flaw in the plan.George: What was that, sir?Edmund: It was bollocks.Baldrick: So the poor old ostrich died for nothing.Ok, fine, this simplifies things just a tad. But it’s more accurate than it should be. We can add to this an insane level of Serbian nationalism that held that Serbs were the best and brightest in the world, and they’d easily beat Austria-Hungary in any war. This is rather like an ant who believes it could defeat the elephant, when the reality is that the elephant could step on it without knowing.The entangled alliances made things worse. The Serbs struck out at AH through their agents in the Black Hand (possibly the best terrorist group name ever), AH responded with a series of ultimata. Serbia accepted most, but wanted time to sort out a couple of them, but Austria-Hungary wasn’t having that, and attacked. Serbia went crying to their big brother, Russia, who then got involved, which forced Germany to join in on Austria’s side, which required France to join in on Russia’s side, and then Germany violated Belgian neutrality, which forced the UK to enter alongside the French and Russians. Soon the Ottomans were joining Germany and Austria (which is slightly ironic on a historical level), and Italy threw in on the side of the allies.Here’s the fun part: pretty much everyone thought the war would be over quickly. They all figured, in their own way, that they’d go give Johnny Foreigner a good thrashing and be home in time for Christmas. They all assumed that God was on their side, and they’d win easily, and topple the enemy.So Serbian nationalism, mixed in with entangling alliances, and extreme overconfidence and arrogance on the part of every power involved, all combined in the most toxic way imaginable, and just like that a whole continent was burning. And once the shooting began, almost everyone succumbed to a version of the Sunk-Cost Fallacy; “if we stop fighting now, then all our boys would have died for nothing!”There are so many chances for this war to have been prevented.Serbia could have accepted the ultimatum and put up with the Austrians causing havoc for a few days until their honor was satisfied.Russia could have found a way to mobilize only against Austria, and not against Germany as well.The UK and France could have made it clear that they weren’t going to get involved.Germany could have honored Belgian neutrality, thus avoiding the first steps at getting America into the war.But alas, once the guns of August began to fire, there was no stopping it. Millions died to no good cause, governments around Europe toppled, Communism took over in Russia, and the stage was set for the even more horrible sequel.Such a horrible, tragic waste."

855,"The standard hard disk drive (HDD) has been the predominant storage device for desktop computers and laptops for a long time. But now, with the invention of solid state drive (SSD) technology, computer buyers and users now have access to the latest innovation that’s setting new trends in the storage market. So which one should you go for – the HDD or SSD? Read on to find out.What is an HDD?A hard disk drive (HDD) is basically a storage device in a computer. It is comprised of metal platters with magnetic coating, spindle, and various moving parts to process and store data. The common size for laptop hard drives in the 2.5” model, while a larger 3.5” model is usually found in desktop computers.What is an SSD?A solid state drive (SSD) is also another type of data storage that performs the same job as an HDD. But insteading of storing data in a magnetic coating on top of platters, an SSD uses flash memory chips and an embedded processor to store, retrieve, and cache data. It is roughly about the same size as a typical HDD, and bears the resemblance of what smartphone batteries would look like.HDD and SSD ComparisonNow let’s take a closer look at the two devices. We break it down into the following main categories:SpeedThis is where SSDs truly prevail. While HDDs need a long time to access data and files because the disk must spin to find it, SSDs are up to 100 times faster since data can be accessed instantly. This is why an SSD-equipped PC will boot within seconds and deliver blazing fast speed for launching programs and applications, whereas a computer that uses a HDD will take much longer time to boot the operating system, and will continue to perform slower than an SSD during normal use.CapacityAs of writing, SSD units top out at 16TB storage capacity. Although there are large SSDs, anything that’s over 512GB is beyond most people’s price range. HDDs, on the other hand, have large capacities (1-2TB) available for much more affordable prices.DurabilityHDDs consist of various moving parts and components, making them susceptible to shock and damage. The longer you use your HDD, the more they wear down and most eventually end up failing. Meanwhile, an SSD uses a non-mechanical design of flash storage mounted on a circuit board, providing better performance and reliability, and making it more likely to keep your files and data safe.NoiseAn HDD can sometimes be the loudest part of your computer. Even the highest-performing HDDs will emit some noise when the drive is spinning back and forth to process data. SSDs have no moving parts, meaning it makes no noise at all.HeatMore moving part means more heat, and HDD users will have to live with the fact that their device will degenerate over time. SSD uses flash memory, generating less heat, helping to increase its lifespan.CostTo be frank, SSDs are much more expensive than HDDs for the same capacity. This is why most computers with an SSD only have a few hundred gigabytes of storage. HDDs are about twice as cheaper than SSDs.Despite the high costs and low capacity, SSD is a clear winner over the HDD in terms of performance. While you’re paying more for less memory with an SSD, you’re investing in a faster and far more durable data storage option in the long run.We recommend using an SSD as the primary storage for your operating system, applications, and most-used programs. You can install another HDD inside the same computer to store documents, movies, music, and pictures – these files don’t need to leverage the incredible access times and speed of SSD.Looking to invest in some new hardware for your business?

My dogs started doing this and it became known they contracted Parvo… which CAN be a deadly and contagious disease.. SO.. until you know for sure.. every spot where the bile is thrown up, whether its indoor or outdoor..needs to be bleached… its imperative you do this or reoccurence or even spreading of the disease is a high probability…Now make sure your dogs paws are also bleached (buy the pads where the bleach content is mixed in properly)… It a lot of dry heaves occur and lethargic behavior… you really need to have your dog tested… And while this is happening you truly need to separate your pets..isolate them… there feed bowls and water bowls ALL need to be sanitized..Heres the good news… Vets have came a LONG ways… with a few antibiotics and a infusion of these “Vet packs” they have a good probability of survival… The main killer of Parvo symptoms is dehydration…plain and simple… if your dog is consuming higher than normal amount of water /lethargic/ and yellow/green bile… its TIME to take them in.. Again high probability of survival… but I will admit… its costly and this treatment isn't over night.. its a week or so… and you will have to continue to sterilize and clean up and isolate your pet the entire time afterwards for a while once they are home from the vet…Again this is ONLY a worse case scenario but as a parent we need to be concerned with these possibilities in part we owe it to our other pets… The very simple cause for the yellow ? Your dog once again ate something and its not setting well or doesn't agree with there digestive system… If it occurs more than a few times..its obviously time to get them checked..and ALWAYS ALWAYS make sure there up on there shots so this is not a possibility in future if you have not already!!"
857,"Great question! Firstly, we should probably identify a few issues that this question involves, the first being the issue of scale. In the case of this question, you’re asking about the significance of your life in relation to two extremely different scale sets (world vs. universe). The other qualifier that makes this question a tough one to answer is simply the definition of significance. Finally, your life also can have several meanings, from the bacterial frameworks in your cellular composition to the other people that are a part of your life, and therefore directly impacted by you.Instead of getting into an argument with myself about semantics, let’s focus on scales for a second, and what “significance” inside of those scales mean. I’ll use wavelengths and their frequencies for this little metaphor: the visible scale takes up less than a quarter of a quarter of a quarter of a fraction of the known or “useful” scale of wavelengths. Wavelengths of energy can range from the incredibly small (visible light only encompasses 310 nm - from 390–700nm - of the electromagnetic spectrum) to massive (planet or star sized wavelengths). So if the tiniest portions of this infinite scale can encompass everything from microwaves, to gamma rays, to the the visible light that is responsible for life itself, then we can state that the very small can be very significant . . . to us. On the scale that we live on: you are significant. On the bigger scale, nothing matters or is significant except the beginning and the end - and we question that those are even things.Because of the way this question is phrased, there can be no answer that isn’t philosophical (the question implies a basic philosophical conundrum), but allow me to take a blind stab at it! Yes. Yes, we hold an intrinsic value to the Universe and the World simply by being alive, self-aware, and curious. The reason we hold a higher value than even light is because of the isolation of our occurrence and the projection that we are rare. Being rare is one of the few things that makes an item, a type, or even life valuable.Will your passage from life to death be noted? Yes. By the life inside of your body and by the life around you. Will the non-conscious portions of the universe give a crap? No, but then, how much do you really care about that? To make a physics pun and drop mic: you matter.I cut this portion out: Light cannot see itself, nor shows any effective consciousness, and therefore should not have an identification of significance to itself. It is significant to us, but how significant it is in the universe at large, especially compared to the non-visible spectrum, is unknown. Our impact on the universe is unknown, because the universe does not make it a habit to give us reports on our effectiveness."
858,"I routinely hire new immigrants with solid java/j2ee development experience in Auckland. My last hire was from India, and had been in NZ for three weeks when he started. He had a silver fern visa. The one before that was from China and here on a student visa doing post grad study in comp sci. The company I work for is less than 30% kiwi, and there are people from 10 different countries.The market for developers and testers in Auckland is robust, but it will depend on your years of experience, particular expertise, applied knowledge, and english fluency.Auckland is an immigrant city, and the skill shortage means that workplaces must be more diverse and open to immigrants than previous posters have suggested. Outside auckland may be a different story. Employers will be impatient with poor English. You need to have your visa sorted, and be in NZ for face to face interviews to be taken seriously.Jobs are on seek and trademe, but try to find a good agent who sees your potential and will market your unique skills effectively. They get a commission  from the employer equal to 12-17% of your first years salary, so they will work hard to find you a spot. Consider contracting if you visa will allow it. Kiwi employers are wary of candidates that have worked for mega-corporations on vast teams where their individual input on projects might be limited. This seems more common with applicants from India and China, and I've seen heaps of applicants with years of experience but limited accomplishments because they've spent years warming a chair and making up headcount for outsource consultancies like IBM. Kiwi employers are also wary of career advancement earned through study,  rather than on the job achievement. To combat this find some way to demonstrate applied skills and knowledge in your specialty area that is equal to your number of years experience. Show them that you can work independently and take initiative.Most NZ companies are much smaller by comparison, and they will expect you to adapt to the flatter heirarchies in NZ very quickly. The smaller size and informality can be a real culture shock, and  if you don't prove you can work independently then they will simply churn you within 90 days. Be prepared to make slightly less than market rates for your first year or two until you can acquire some NZ professional references.Good luck!"

862,First of all I understand the situation you are in. I am also in a FWB situation. You need to be honest with her in your not wanting a relationship beyond what it is. If you continue the relationship knowing how she feels and you keep quiet about your feelings not developing the same as hers you are purposely causing her emotional pain. I did not get the sense in your question that you were concerned about that. I hope I am wrong. Open a conversation with her about what you want. Be honest without being cruel. Let her make the decision of whether or not to move on.
863,"As someone who has fronted a band as a lead singer and knows very little about professional singing - I can agree with the consensus above that there is probably no substitute for a great coach. However - since you seem to be interested in doing it yourself - I think there are still a few things you can do to make yourself a lot better than you already are. Quick and dirty:1. PRACTICE. I can't emphasize this enough. Your singing voice is like a muscle that gets soft and mushy if you don't exercise it. You don't have to sing scales. I used to get tons of practice driving alone and singing at the very top of my lungs along with the radio or pre-recorded tunes -  with the windows rolled up. Please keep the windows rolled up. :)2. Practice breathing from your diaphragm. This might take a little work if you haven't done it before. One way to do this is to lie down on your back and place a book on your stomach. Practice taking deep breaths that fill up your belly and not just shallow lung filling breaths. The book should rise and fall - if it doesn't move, you aren't doing it right. Once you have that down - practice taking diaphragm breaths while singing and see how much more power your voice has.3. Try to be aware of your natural range, and where your voice crosses into a falsetto. Many people tend to sound nasally and flat when they hit higher notes because they are not opening up the back of their throat enough. Try singing some scales and when you cross into a higher range focus on creating space at the back of your soft palate by contracting it up like you are trying to hold a golf ball at the back of your tongue without swallowing it. ( sounds uncomforatble i know, but sometimes having a visual can help you do something that sounds or feels unnatural at first). Opening you mouth wider will also help with the nasally part.4. Over-enunciate. It will feel ridiculous - but it will sound better.These things won't make you a professional - but they will take you further than you think. As Sara mentioned it is also really instructive to record yourself so you can get a better idea of where you are experiencing trouble. I almost never know if something is a good take or not until I hear it played back. Most importantly, remember singing is fun, so try not take yourself too seriously - unless of course, you do -in which case you should probably take that lesson :)."
864,"They don't.In a way that was their problem. They were too busy doing science, and didn't feel they also needed to sell a glossy package to the public. Also, they were scientists, not PR professionals. They felt if they did their studies and presented their data and results, they were done - others would take it from there.But the resistance to their results, originally by oil companies, DID focus on PR. They lobbied Congress, paid their think tanks to come up with denialist language, had handsome spokespeople dismiss the scientific results.Meanwhile, Exxon was doing it's own research on global warming, and reaching the same conclusions as the scientists. They just kept it secret for a long time, while outwardly talking and paying for the denialist rhetoric. But that’s another story..In recent years, scientific organizations have tried to be better at PR. Once in a while you see a TV episode from National Geographic say, or efforts by philanthropists like Al Gore. But all their work is NOTHING compared to the full-on and multi-pronged campaigns by business interests.Just the fact that you asked the question like this, mentioning the scientists’ PR efforts but completely omitting the fossile fuel efforts (which are thousands times more money spent). It means you've bought some of the denialist rhetoric and have been “educated” to focus blame on the wrong side."

868,"Thanks for the A2A Surabhi.I'm outside the US and so can offer a slightly different perspective from the other commentators.The answer to your question is yes: it's perfectly possible for patients to post reviews of their doctors, their hospitals, and so on. In the UK for a while there were plans to publish ""league tables"" of surgeons, so that patients could see who got the best outcomes. While all of these are very seductive, there are loads of reasons why I am deeply sceptical about them.Let's take the league table first. Let's make it simple: we have two surgeons, Dr A and Dr B, who each do the same operations, coronary bypass surgery. Dr A has a 2% 30-day mortality, while Dr B has a 10% 30-day mortality. To the lay person, Dr A is clearly the better doctor, right? You wouldn't want that clumsy butcher Dr B operating on you.But behind the scenes, Dr A cherry-picks only the easiest ops on the fittest patients. He turns down many patients because he thinks they are too risky: they might hurt his numbers. Meanwhile, Dr B picks up Dr A's rejects. He's a bit more courageous. He says to his patients: sure, you're not in great shape, but without the surgery you will be worse off. He might even be more technically skilled than Dr A. And the 90% of his patients who survive think he is a miracle worker. Dr B cares about looking after his patients and not what some number says about his skills or his care.Let's consider two patients, Mr X and Mr Y. Each needs a heart bypass operation. X goes to visit Dr A. X is in pretty good shape, A does the op, everything looks rosy, and X writes A a glowing review.Y goes to see Dr A. Y is unfortunately overweight, diabetic and a smoker. Mr A tells Y that the operation is too risky. That he will need to stop smoking, get his sugar under control and lose a bit of weight before he will consider operating on him. This is good medical practice. Meanwhile Y is fed up being lectured to by doctors about his weight. He loves his pies and his fags. So he writes a nasty review of A.My point about this last one bears repeating more clearly. Sometimes, for the very best reasons, doctors cannot give patients what they want. Sometimes patients' expectations are unrealistic. Sometimes a doctor's treatments are limited. None of this makes them a bad doctor.Let me be clear on one final point: there are bad doctors. Only a few, mind, but they are out there. But the clumsy tools of league tables or patient reviews are hopeless at identifying them."

870,"Looking for some thrillers that take place entirely in a single enclosed space? Here are 13 best:Devil: M. Night takes the producer chair in this horror flick about a literal elevator ride from hell, where a group of strangers realize they are trapped in an elevator with the devil! After the abysmal ratings following the bloated Last Airbender, it was sure good to see M. Night back in the creative environment he's best suited- involved in a little indie with a big concept.The Killing Room: Back in the 50s and 60s, the American government conducted a rash of freaky experiments on unsuspecting citizens. The code name for the covert CIA mind-control and chemical research program was called MK-ULTRA, and basically it was like an evil version of the Dharma Initiative.The Killing Room works under the premise that the program was never shut down and people are still being tricked into participating in said freaky experiments in the name of national security. One of the things that makes The Killing Room stand out, is you get to see on both sides of the experiment. Another reason to check it out is that it's from World Battle: Los Angeles director Jonathan Liebesman.Unknown: In this mostly... wait for it... unknown thriller, five men wake up in a locked-down warehouse with no memory of who they are. They are forced to figure out who is good and who is bad to stay alive. A little like The Killing Room, Unknown sort of fell through the cracks and most people caught it on cable. It has an amazing cast in James Caviezel, Greg Kinnear, Bridget Moynahan, Joe Pantoliano, Barry Pepper, Jeremy Sisto and totally stands up. Peppered with flashback, some may argue this isn't strictly a one-room thriller, but it's close enough in my books.Exam: In new British thriller,, eight talented candidates have reached the final stage of selection to join the ranks of a mysterious and powerful corporation. Entering a windowless room, an ""Invigilator"" gives them 80 minutes to answer one question. He outlines three rules they must obey: don't talk to him or the armed guard by the door, don't spoil their papers and don't leave the room. The candidates turn over their question papers, only to find they're completely blank. Thus begins Stuart Hazeldine's powerful debut, a largely bloodless thriller that nonetheless keeps you guessing until the end. One thing I liked about Exam is the subtle way that Hazeldine makes us feel that we're in a science fiction universe full of designer drugs, economic meltdown and evil corporations without leaving this room. Defintiely worth checking out now that it's on DVD in Stateside.1408 is not just one of the best one-room horror flicks, but it's one of the best Stephen King adaptions yet. It strays a little from the short story by adding a bit of a backstory, but the basic concept of a hack ghost writer who stumbles upon the real thing is examined to its fullest here. I don't know about you guys, but I generally don't like ghost stories. Probably because I've seen too many of them and they always turn out the same (the ghosts need our help). But somehow this one really got under my skin. Also, Cusack is a strong lead here and handles what is essentially a one man show with great dignity.If you're reading this and haven't seen Cube yet, just stop reading, go watch it and come back.

871,"Yes. There can be several reasons. The most common is if you ejaculated recently you won't have as much semen. The time varies by person depending on individual bodies, age and how horny you are. I believe a lot of horniness in men comes from the build up of semen in the prostate gland. So age,  physical condition, natural abilities, arousal level and other factors affect that. I wouldn't worry about it. If you are concerned or if your orgasm doesn't feel good or hurts you could have a prostate infection. See a doctor. If you're masturbating daily or more this could be the cause."
872,"Foremost thing that matters in clearing any competitive exam is the approach and direction. This is further dependent on the Faculty, Study Material, Mentoring and other important factors.Many of us get into some institutes where a lot of students have already given there attempts 3–4 times or batch strength is more than 30. A beginner can never understand and start from the concepts in these kind of classes. Also, some institutes hire inexperienced faculty and do injustice to their students.I would suggest look for an institute where initially you can attend free demo classes(more than 1), Study material should be updated, faculty who is expert in their subjects like Quant, LR, GS or English, and provide updated testing environment.I have a keen interest in guiding aspirants for govt. jobs and other fields too. I researched about various institutions in Chandigarh by visiting and attending demo classes. I found some are really good in teaching but batch sizes are 30+, some have good material and testing but faculty is inexperienced.There was one institute in Sector 34-A named “My Career”. They have started the institute afresh in Chandigarh although have quite well-reputed center in Bathinda (as some sources told me from the city). Main benefit is it is run by IIM Alumni and very experienced faculty who have actually taught students for MBA. Study material is also fine. Major plus point here would be that they have started in the city, so they are really working hard to give good results and provide good coaching & training to students and hence excel in the league. So, after all research and counsel, I would recommend My Career Institute to all for SSC and Banking Coaching. You guys can atleast visit and attend demo classes there. All the Best !! :)"

Our school was doing a holiday food drive, and we decided to give our shenanigans a philanthropic twist. We all dressed in our winter coats, scarves and santa hats, and set off to sing.My friends consist mainly of band kids with a smattering of chior so we weren't bad at singing, just not great. At every house we would wait for them to open the door then launch into our song. When we finished and they offered candy we politely asked for canned food donations instead.In about an hour of caroling, we collected four large shopping bags of food. We delivered it to the school for the food drive the next day.In the end, everyone had a blast and we got some good donations to a charitable cause, so it was a double win.I highly recommend Christmas caroling this Halloween!"
875,"For mutual fund investments in India, you do not need a demat account.

I will advise you NOT to demat your mutual fund holdings - there is no particular advantage of that.As regards stocks, first please check if you have the right temperament to advise in stocks directly - mutual fund will do the same for you, at a very nominal fund management charge in case of a direct plan.Still if you wish to invest in stocks, note that NRI cannot do intra day trading and can invest only through a PIS demat account. You need to ask your bank to open a separate PIS demat account and also open a separate bank account and link the two.

876,"Bonus IssueA bonus issue is a stock dividend, allotted by the company to reward the shareholders. The bonus shares are issued out of the reserves of the company. These are free shares that the shareholders receive against shares that they currently hold. These allotments typically come in a fixed ratio such as, 1:1, 2:1, 3:1 etc.If the ratio is 2:1 ratio, the existing shareholders get 2 additional shares for every 1 share they hold at no additional cost. So if a shareholder owns 100 shares then he will be issued an additional 200 shares, so his total holding will become 300 shares. When the bonus shares are issued, the number of shares the shareholder holds will increase but the overall value of investment will remain the same.Companies issue bonus shares to encourage retail participation, especially when the price per share of a company is very high and it becomes tough for new investors to buy shares. By issuing bonus shares, the number of outstanding shares increases, but the value of each share reduces.In your case you will get 33 shares from the company.HAPPY TRADING…"
877,"Let’s see.#1: Till end of the year, people will exchange or deposit existing 500 and 1000 notes at banks and post office. However, you need to show a valid government ID proof and the banks and post offices will have to maintain proper transaction records for the same.For smaller amounts, there should be no issue. But if someone comes and deposits 1L in cash, it might be highlighted and escalated to the government. Modi government might have advised banks and post offices to escalate all transactions above a certain threshold.All of these folks will have their background checks done and can expect a tax audit next year if their tax returns, income details etc do not justify the amount they have in black.#2: Political parties can no longer disburse cash to poor people in exchange for votes.#3: People in the real estate market will be hurt the most.I recently saw a hoarding advertising the price of a new flat for possession at Rs 1.2 Cr. However, the hoarding said, “Rs 1.1 Cr if you pay cash”.The maths is simple. In the first arrangement, you pay 1.2 Cr, of which some 30L goes to government as tax, and 90L goes to the builder. In the second, you pay 1.1 Cr (saving yourself a sweet 10L) and all of it goes to the builder (who nets 20L more). All of it at the loss of the government.Brokers too can no longer ask people to pay in cash. I, as recently as Feb, had to pay 35,000 as the brokerage. All in cash, as the broker would simply not accept an online transfer.#4: All currency hoarded with terrorists and corrupt folks is now simply useless. “A terrorist walked into the bank branch with a briefcase full of cash and a fake ID…” just doesn’t sound funny.#5: All counterfeit currency production comes to a grinding halt. Counterfeiting Rs 100 and below currency notes does not make sense as it is economically unprofitable. So almost all fake currency is in the form of 500 and 1000 notes and no one is going to accept them now, so they are cut off from the money market.Going forward, it would be harder to counterfeit the new 500 and 2000 currency notes as they come with a whole set of new security features.#6: Forces people to resort to the banking system.Majority of the Indian populace isn’t corrupt. They don’t hoard money at home because they want to chat on their taxes. They just do it because they do not trust “online banking” or the banking system. Now these people will be forced to let go of their unfounded fears, slowly moving the nation on the path of becoming a cashless economy.The more people transact online, the easier it would be for the government to keep track of all money movement and catch hold of those who abuse the system."
878,"I’m going to start with some very simple, very direct advise that should be taken very seriously.DO NOT GO INTO ENGINEERING OR MEDICINE UNLESS YOU ARE ABSOLUTELY PASSIONATE ABOUT IT.I have seen and work with numerous engineers you became engineers for the sole reason of job security and excellent pay. They make terrible products, do terrible work, cost the company far more than they are worth, and cause untold amounts of grief to their co-workers. Don’t be that guy.Disinterested Doctors have personally screwed up my wife’s health because they failed to listen to her and ignored her charts because they assumed she was a “typical 20 year old” (even though she was approaching 30 at the time which shows how much they ignored her chart). Don’t be that doctor.…I don’t care for law. I personally find it to be one of those useless careers with the exception of people like Barack Obama who devote themselves to passing laws that help the less fortunate. I think that falls under a similar category of passion and interest too, so whatever.Now that I said that… what should you do?If you want employment that has A.) job security B.) pays well and C.) you don’t have a passion about anything you can think to put into a career…I suggest you become a plumber.It will always have huge demand as long as humans have running water and bathrooms. It pays a ton (250k USD/year average mid-career which is WAAAAYYY more than I make as an engineer), requires no additional schooling (i.e. no student loan dept). These are also not the “jobs” politicians say we need more of (those are more manufacturing/resource allocation type positions). Plumbers are in high demand are their demand is expected to increase as more kids your age are going to college and more plumbers retire.So what do you do about your parents and college???Lie to them. Tell them you’re going to college. Take their money for college (I’m assuming this non-optional push is because they are paying for it, if not then WTF), and invest it in something fairly stable (I would say US bonds but I’m and engineer not an investor or financial adviser so go talk them to get a better idea about it). When your parents find out (and they will eventually) give them their money back with the interest you made on it (after all that was their money). They will probably be sad/disappointed you lied and didn’t go to college but they will be happy that you had your head on your shoulders, made a good financial decision and made them money in doing so. Eventually they will realize that their preconceived notions of what may be a good future for you may not be the case in today’s world as the cost/benefit ratio of a college degree is going way south.Meanwhile you can show up to their house on Thanksgiving in your new Ferrari after you paid off your home in full in 3 years because you decided to not take their advice and go to college.NOTE: I would like to add that going after your passion and what you are talented at is a better choice than doing this but many high-school graduates/college bound freshmen don’t know what their passions or talents are and use college as a super expensive way of finding out about a very small part of themselves. This is a far better option if that is the case for you.And you can always go to college later when you find your bliss (or skip it altogether and start your own business doing your bliss you should be very knowledgeable in the real world by then even if you don’t feel like it)"

881,"I predict the Berlin scene will slowly move further into Eastern Europe, in particular to Warsaw and Krakow Poland, and maybe later on to somewhere like Vilnius, Lithuania, or even Belgrade, Serbia. These locations are cheap, historically rich, and have very interesting developing alternative art and music scenes--lots of electronic music, goth/punk, and even some rap, surprisingly enough. Poland is very up-and-coming these days. I think we'll be seeing a lot of interesting art and music coming out of there in the next 5 to 10 years, and more and more people moving there... especially Krakow. Poland is currently celebrating it's autonomy, democracy and emerging economy. As a result, Krakow is becoming hot. But Warsaw is also up-and-coming and is full of unoccupied industrial spaces, so Warsaw--is my top candidate for ""the next Berlin.""Istanbul is another option. It's cultural wealth has no parallel, and it's art and tech scenes are growing rapidly. It's also the nexus of the East and the West. Istanbul is, quite possibly, the next Berlin.In the US, I could see any of: Baltimore/Detroit/New Orleans becoming the new North American alternative arts hub. All of these cities are suffering from depressed economies and therefore there exist many cheap places for artists to rent space and create. I also believe that local governments may be more permissive to nightclubs than in other jurisdictions as part of the urban renewal of these cities. Baltimore has an incredibly influential independent music scene in addition to a vibrant art scene and cheap rent. Detroit and NoLa seem to be in earlier stages of community development than Baltimore. I think Detroit has a great chance due to all the cheap property. And NoLa has a great chance because it's SO culturally vibrant and historical. All are very dangerous, but that will change with gentrification.Montreal was mentioned, but it's already an international alternative arts hub. People aren't going to start moving to Montreal in droves because it's not as cheap as Berlin and the gentrification already started... years ago.In South America, I've heard that Lima is becoming hot. (See ""Vampires of Lima"" in What was the Hipster?) Buenos Aires has a great art/music scene and cheap rent, but it's not particularly ""alternative"" and its identity is already formed. In your question, you asked ""what's next?"" and Buenos Aires is happening now and has been happening for awhile. Maybe Lima is next. It's way too early to tell though.Sao Paulo, Brazil and Santiago, Chile are also on my artistic radar... but they're too formed and expensive already for one to think they could turn into the sort of alternative arts hub Berlin is today."

883,"I don’t have children but my sister does. I live very close to them and sometimes look after the kids.The most challenging part is actually to have enough money to maintain a normal living for your family.AccommadationFirst you need to live somewhere . Some people cannot afford living separately from their parents. In that case they don’t always get along with each other.Few people can afford buying an apartment . Very often parents financially help their grown children to buy one.So you might rent one paying about 20–30% of you salary. It’s fine when you’re alone and can move if your landlord tells you to. But if you have kids you want more stable conditions.TransportIf you have small kids sometimes you need to take them to a hospital very quickly. You would better have a car. Not everyone can afford a new car in Ukraine. You might buy a used one but then you spend money on a repair.Education is officially free in Ukraine. But actually parents spend a lot of money on their’s children schools. Teachers come up with different excuse to leach money from parents. For instance for a repair, for new windows. Some teachers offer additional paid classes for kids who are ‘lagging behind’ to boost their knowledge. But actually it’s a good way to earn money from pupils’ parents.Often teacher have no one choice because their salaries are a joke.Healthcare is also free in Ukraine. But if you go to hospital they have a million ways to charge money from you especially if we are talking about kids. Doctors might earn only 200$ in Ukraine. So very often you need to pay ‘under the counter’I didn’t mention some obvious expenditures on food, cloths and so on"

885,"You have wrong facts in your question. India is not badmouthing OBOR anywhere. OBOR has CPEC as its part and that’s where we raised the issue of sovereignty of our nation. CPEC is planned to be built in POK, which still is our land.Secondly India is not the only country, leaders, ministers and officials from Germany, France, England, Greece, Portugal and Estonia had objections to the original text of the communique over issues of transparency and environmental protection. http://m.economictimes.com/news/...If China says India has no right at doka la region in Sikkim and it's the third party nation there, the same goes with China in Kashmir. We can't just sit mum.It is endorsed by UNSC because no nation in that council has any problem with it. That's why China is not letting India in UNSC as a permanent member, because then we too will have Vito powers. It is just a fact that this membership was given to India, but because of the worst decision ever by our former prime minister Nehru Ji, we gave it to our “lovely” neighbours."
886,"Yes, it feels wonderful, this is exactly what every guys want during sex, or you can say that it is a gift of nature, that a women's vagina get wet when they are sexually aroused.During intercourse, either penis or vagina needs to be get wet to proceed the things very smooth. Simply, it helps penis to easily slide into her vagina. Otherwise, human body parts generates a lot of friction to avoid any movement against eachother.Once, when I have a sex with my girlfriend, her vagina get wet after 10 minutes of very slow foreplay. Then I uses that wetness to rub my penis against her clitoris and she was moaning like a real slut. This all end up with a very successful intercourse."

888,"Length of a human being depends on the length of his/her bones, especially long bones.So these bones have growing ends, which grow upto a certain age.After the growing ends have ossified , we stop growing in height.The age of ossification is different in boys and girls.Girls usually stop growing at a younger age than boys.So if you are a girl, I am afraid you don't have much of a chance to grow anymore.Your parents height :Wow!! My parents are almost the same as yours in comparison to height.So there is this formula of calculating a child's height from parents height.Mid parental height=(father's height +mother's height in cm +/-13) ÷2( + in case of male and - in case of female)Now the target height of the child is MPH+/-8.5 cmSo lets calculate.If you are a boy, your MPH should be, (167+162.5+13)÷2=171.5 cmAnd if you are a girl, then it should be,(167+162–13)÷2=158.25So remember the formula for target height? yes, MPH+/- 8.5 cm.So if a boy, 171.5+/-8.5 cmIf a girl, 158.25+/-8.5cmThose are your normal ranges. God I hate calculations!! Haha!!My storySo I was this average height guy, in school. At the end of Med school, tallest of the class. Ok, so what did I do? Nothing actually.I ate normally, slept, played, swam, did some cycling etc etc.Normally it's said that bones grow during ur sleep. So try to have a proper amount of sleep, eat proper amount of calcium containing foods, drink milk, get a bit of sun exposure if u don't, cause vitamin D is important too.Best of luck.Forgot to add, I am 6 feet 2 inches by the way."
889,"I actually got fired fairly recently. I was working for a company in Atlanta, programming sensitive measuring devices for quality inspections. In 2015, the company hired a new supervisor, who was simply a terrible person to work with. She and I did not get along and, the first chance she got, she fired me. Luckily for me, I was also doing contract work on the side, and one of the company's I was consulting hired me fulltime before the week was out. I was only unemployed for three days.Unlucky for my previous employer, there was no one in the organization who could do my job. My former boss was so detached that she didn't even realize this until after I was gone. About two weeks later, the entire department had come to a screeching stop, and they actually called and asked if I wanted to return to work. They might have been a little hasty in their decision, they said. They had done a little soul searching, and were willing to let me come back on a “probationary” basis.Well, I was able to tell them thanks but no thanks. I already had another job making more money.A few more days went by, and they called me yet again, and asked if I could, at least, come back and train someone. HR actually insinuated that I had, somehow, treated the company unfairly.I told them I would be more than happy to come back and train someone… for 50 bucks an hour, that is.Hell no. That was highway robbery; they simply wouldn't pay it.“Suit yourself.” I replied.Another week went by, and work continued to pile up. They were still trying to find someone to help them out, but things were going very slowly. By the middle of the week, they called me back, and agreed to my terms. However, by this time, I just wanted to be an ass, so I told them that my price had gone up. I was now charging 75 an hour for training.Of course this went over like a concrete balloon, and they told me that they weren't going to be exploited by a former employee.“Fine by me,” I replied. “But don't call me again.”Well, this time they didn't call back. Instead they contacted the manufacturer, and had them send in a Tech to train a few people.What did he charge them?I heard through the grapevine that it was around 5000 a week and, by my calculations, my dismissal ended up costing the company around 30,000 dollars. At least that’s been the tally so far.Man… they REALLY showed me.LOL."
890,"Showing my age here…Male or female, that would have to involve spandex! Either that, or the brightly coloured over sized track suits (think MC Hammer).If you want to be on the safe side though, just wear some Adidas, Fila, Puma, LA Gear or Tommy Hilfiger tracksuits (think Run DMS or Puff Daddy -later P Diddy and now just Sean Combs I think).

891,"It happens all the time with everyone at some point or the other. I have had friends, female friends, girlfriends do that to me in the past. All you can do is try to get in touch with them a few times and if they don’t respond after a few attempts ( Let’s say 6), you need to let them go and live your life. If they are not replying after repeated attempts you made to talk to them, that means, they are ignoring you for dead sure.!In these cases, you don’t have to feel bad, but good that YOU tried your best to get in touch with the person. You were the BIGGER man/woman who swallowed the insults and non-acknowledgement and still made an effort. If the friendship broke, it is not your fault anymore because you were the one who tried to stay in touch and tried to communicate. It is on the person who is ignoring to talk to you now, you did your best. Forget this person and move on. Keep your doors open for them to walk back in your life, remember, there is a difference between you and this ignoring person, let the difference remain, Stay CLASSY, but remind them of their behavior when they come back in your life.There are many, many people out there of all kinds of age, sex, race, nationalities and background that you can befriend . All you have to do is be a good, honest person with pure intentions, you be humble and the world will salute you!Good luck."
892,"I strongly disagree with most of the answers here. Don’t let “so called economists” mislead you who says after demonetization of 500/1000 rupees notes, the real estate sector will go down, without correcting your facts.People are claiming that real estate industry involves the maximum amount of black money, and as there will be shortage of black money after government’s bold decision, the demand for the properties will reduce. And as the demand supply graph works, lower demand means lower prices. The thing you are missing here is, real estate sector is not just about black money and pricing system in an industry is not just about demand and supply relation.We can divide this industry in majorly two parts to understand the effects of currency ban:1. Agriculture land and individual plots: These are the two types of properties which might see the downfall.These properties are generally bought long back with a very lesser amount compared to the present rates, so the prices of these two types of properties are completely depended on the market value. So if the market value of any property decreases, automatically the price of that property will decrease. Now since these properties involve the maximum amount of black money, shortage of black money will reduce the number of potential buyers from market, reducing market value, finally reducing the prices.2. All the other type of properties (Commercial office spaces, apartments, developer plots, villas etc.)These types of properties involve negligible or no black money. So the reduction of black money will have minimum effect on the demand of these types of properties.Secondly prices of these are not just depended on the market demand. A huge amount is first invested by builders to develop the property. So in these cases margins on invested amount plays a major role in deciding the property’s price. Since the real estate market has already been witnessing recession since last 3 years, builders have reduced their margins to the lowest. So there is no further scope of price reductions as no businessman will sell his product with a loss. The prices may stay still, but will not see downfall for sure.The mentioned points are the cases when the demand stays the same as before or goes down. But we should notice here that since the banks will be flooded with cash after government’s decision of demonetization of 500/1000 rupees notes, the loan process will be eased and the interest rates will be reduced. These properties were already being transacted without any black money, and now since there would be easy home loans at lower interest rates, demand of these properties might even INCREASE.So guys please correct your facts and stop believing everything you read. This time is the best time to buy property. The prices may not go up in a short span, but these will not go down for sure."
893,"IIM Shillong Interview : 2017This was one unique question I faced since it was no where related to management (in an IIM interview). The reason being, I discussed about administrative services in CD (Case based GD as well).Panel members : P Candidate : SP : Sandeep, you brought in a point about administration & you said you are a logical thinker as well. Let me put you in a situation.S : Okay sir .P : You are the collector of a big unit like Lucknow. At morning 4 am, you receive a call that there has been a bus accident and some people are killed as well as injured. Just when you were about to leave , you receive another phone call that some drunk people (about 6–7) are drowning in the river. When you were just deciding what to do next, you receive third call saying that nearest biggest cinema hall has caught fire, it’s almost like a pride for the city of Lucknow. You have just 1 minute to decide. What will be your plan of action?(I like puzzles. Every puzzle has some catch. For me, the catch here is he never really mentioned about any victims in the cinema hall. That was my Eureka moment ! )S : Sir, my least priority would be the cinema hall. Since it’s 4am in the morning, it should be safe to assume there were no movies being played and it should be empty. Hence, my presence won’t change anything. I would dispatch fire emergency services there. Second would be the river drowning. Even if I go there, I don’t know swimming and hence won’t be of much value there. Hence I would send river search operation teams and be in touch with local authorities there. My highest priority would be bus accident since there would be a lot of chaos there. In case of deaths, people block roads which affect the general transport system. Hence the loss would be much higher here.P : What if I say the cinema hall belonged to the most important politician of your state?S : Then, he himself would ensure everything since he would be more desperate to save his property. It’s not even a concern for me then!Panel members laughing ! Verdict : ConvertedConclusion : In puzzles , devil lies in the details. Since I was very much cool about the interview (not much interested for IIMS) and he warned me that he is going to give a puzzle. I listened to his pointers carefully. That really helped !

894,"When you start involving your emotions, you either start trusting them or doubting them.Trusting them means you believe they will not let you down in any way. But humans are not perfect, and neither are you. Trusting is gambling, but in the share market. Any logical human with common sense must know, the share market is not at all gambling. It's completely logical. The shares are bid on the basis of their demand and supply, their financial results, the psychological expectations of the investors in the market, etc. All of these factors are analyzed, and then a decision is taken if a particular security (Equity) is worth investing in. And even then it is unpredictable! To keep the relationship simple, you have to keep the relationship strictly platonic from your point of view. (Don't make it clear to others, just keep it to yourself)That is not easy. And you might just come off as robotic or something. Taking every decision based on the logic of trade, whatever they give you - you give back. And whenever courtesy requires, you're the first one to give. You observe, and invest your trust. How?Gayathri Ganesan's answer to I trust people very quickly and as a result always have been betrayed? What do I do not to trust people and still hold the relation simple? Using logic.But you have to keep in mind, to not to care about whatever anyone might think of you.

Paravirus is an optional, or non-core vaccination. Non-core vaccinations are given based on the individual dog's risk factors, including geographical location. Rabies is the only vaccination required by law (in the United States), and it is given separately from the DDHP, that is, in a different syringe. If you have a veterinarian, or can find one who is open to testing for antibody titers, your dog may not need boosters of these vaccinations as often as usual, with the exception of the rabies vaccination. In the United States at least, rabies titers, though a valid predictor of immunity, are not a legal substitute for vaccination.For more information, see the following: How Often Should You Give Your Pet a Vaccination?Vaccine Titer TestsTiter TestingThe Truth About 'Titering' Instead of Vaccination"
897,"The main differences I can think of are the levels and the rates of development, the population and languages.Overall, Asia is much more developed than Africa although the gap between the rich and the poor is much more stark in Asia than it is in Africa.The rates of development in Asia seem to be slowing down (although still higher) in the past few years while those of African countries seem to be rising (although still lower). GDP growth (annual %).Asia although smaller in terms of land mass, has half of the worlds population and although Africa’s is growing much faster, we are still quite far behind Asia. 2 of the worlds most populous countries, China and India are both in Asia. It is important to note however this with Africa’s much higher population growth rates and negative growth rates in parts of Asia, Africa’s population will likely be equal to Asia around 2150.Past and future population: by Continent.Most of Asia still use their traditional languages as a mode of communication and as the major official languages. In Africa, most of our official languages are those of our colonists as these make it easy for people from different ethnic backgrounds to communicate. While Asia was also colonized, many of the regions were allowed to retain their own languages.Similarities between the two are few, both regions were roughly at the same level economically at the time of getting independence, Asia managed to leverage its population allowing it to compete as a market for cheap labor that attracted investment and left Africa far behind. While there are pockets of development in Africa and pockets of underdevelopment in Asia, Asia is generally much more developed than Africa."

899,"Contract law protects your rights in every agreement. Contract law makes these agreements “enforceable,” which means that it, gives you the power to compensate and obtain money for any damage caused by another party to your business and the common damage is contract breach.Contract law plays a vital role as you don’t know what the other party is planning; it may be right or may be wrong.Below outlined is the importance of contract law:A contract is a written document that describes the full understanding of the business relationship and scope of the work so that no one can claim for anything.Contracts minimize the risk.Contract law provides security and peace of mind to all the parties involved in the transaction.Contracts are the opportunity to agree to confidentiality and non-disclosure provisions that help to protect sensitive information.Various disputes and disagreements may arise between businesses, but in this case, contract help parties to compensate for their damages.However, managing contracts is a very time-consuming process for every business or law firm.

906,"Based on the question, I will presume that you 1) have never made a game and 2) do not know how to write code... which is fine - ultimately that is where everyone starts.TL;DR: I think your best choice today is C# within the Unity3D engine.Build your game, not a game engineI am a strong advocate of ""learning by doing"" instead of ""learning a variety of prerequisite skills related to what you want to do"" and then attempting your project afterwards.  If we're talking about nuclear science then it would be a different story, but game development is at its best when its iterative and interactive.Building a game from scratch is Hard.  If you are starting out today, then there is no good reason to do it.  There are a number of free game engines available today that are well suited to beginners and hobbyists.  If you were really interested in building vector math libraries, audio drivers or animation subsystems, then I suspect you would have asked a different question.Focus on C-based languagesThe majority of games are written in some dialect of C (C,C++,C#,Objective C).  Java (Android and PC) and Actionscript (Flash/web) have a non-trivial share, but C is still the king.The first few generations of game consoles were mostly straight C (and Assembly/machine code) for performance reasons.C++ became an increasing wedge in the early 2000's and is now the predominant language of PC/console games.Objective C is an Apple variant of C which is similar to C++ but is the native language of iOS.C# was developed by Microsoft as a Java alternative.  It was originally used for making windows programs and tools, but has recently gained popularity for games.I would recommend C# because it handles memory management and garbage collection (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mem..., http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gar...) for you.  What are those?  Complicated problems that aren't the interesting part of making games.  It's kinda like having a Tax Accountant.  With that said ... once you learn the basic concepts behind programming it becomes easier to learn new languages - and each new language is easier than the last - so the most important thing is to just start somewhere, anywhere that you can get a foothold.Try Unity UNITY: Game Development ToolI recommend Unity so much these days that I really should start asking for a cut.  In all seriousness it is a great, free toolkit that lets you work at progressive degrees of abstraction, has an active community with lots of component parts that you can pull into your projects.  It also lets you target mobile, web, PC and consoles without having to make big hard choices up front.Most importantly, it has enough built in that you can drag and drop components, write a little bit of code and see immediate results.  It's a great platform to learn as you go and there are lots of tutorials that help you learn the programming concepts along the way."

909,"The simplest way to cancel a policy is to contact them directly by phone. You’ll need to simply explain that you’d like to cancel the policy, which they will gladly accommodate. There are several valid reasons for them to pursue a couple of answers . What you, the consumer, may think is “cancelling auto insurance” may be NOT what you are wanting or needing to be done. Example.. when you sell one vehicle & still have remaining vehicle(s) on your policy… in that instance you need to have a vehicle cancelled from your policy… not “the auto policy cancelled.” Actually, in the industry - I am taking from your choice of wording (through no fault of your own!) your request is asking that you are terminating your policy, not “cancelling” it. Companies cancel coverages, vehicles, delete drivers or operators, but the semantics can become very important.They will not cross examine you.. they simply will want to assure themselves that they are honoring your request n the fashion which best accomplishes the end you seek … which may be a lot different from the words you choose to say.Another example - You may be re-locating to a different State & simply need it “transferred” to you new address (another curve ball - your new address if it is changing to get your refund to you!).OR, are you going to get a new car which will not arrive for another “few weeks.” even a month! IN that circumstance, most times you are far, FAR better off to allow your coverage to remain in force (..even for months!) than you are to cancel your coverage & then attempt to “reinstate” it in a month or two… after 6o days that usually is NEVER an available option..Reinstatement..! You must then re-apply for a new policy & meet all the new administrative requirements which can be very cumbersome & complex for you to accomplish. AND most times you lose your affiliation history which is of high importance in this day & age of auto insurance. And which usually provides you with lower rates.. thru longevity discounts or loyalty discounts!Are you now divorced & your ex was covered under this policy? Does your ex have a vehicle in their name & is it currently covered on the policy you are cancelling? Do they know you are cancelling the policy?Cancelling your auto insurance policy WILL have consequences. USAA will simply want to be certain you & others who may also be listed on this policy will not encounter UNINTENDED Consequences.BY the Way,.. All of the above actually occurred during my career. .. each of the above examples I have put forth as possible reasons a customer wanted to “cancel their insurance” - some with rather dismissive tone & demeanor were real examples. . Some in a brief note/letter mailed to me or my office. And how they are addressing the goal they wished, that which they really wanted to achieve with their auto insurance was NOT what would have been the result And there were mseveraleven more that I did not put forth above, but which would have been consequences never intended by my customer. Many times over my career I was called into the situation after the damage had already been done. In some instances I was unable to “fix” the situation .. or even restore it to where it was before the customer made the errant call or sent a brief e-mail.. or signed letter into our Corporate Customer Service Center(s).I hope all the QUORA Members make note of this Post - it may help them as they journey through their lives & interface with their auto insurance companies. Auto insurance companies do a lot of things for which they they justifiably earn criticism ! But, life is a lo simpler & easier if you do not assume they are simply stupid, invasive, unfriendly or greedy. Give them a chance to earn those labels!So - I am curious… are you wishing to cancel your USAA auto coverage in order to begin it with another carrier, concurrently with the expiry of your policy with USAA? And effective what date? Answering those few questions might provide USAA quickly with enough information to process your request & quickly accomplish what you ask, seamlessly. Hope this helps!"
910,"The problem with answering questions like this is that it’s hard to give an exact answer - your life is different from anyone else’s. So I can only give you an answer based on my own experiences, and that which I have observed in others from the context of my own experiences:Emotions can be layered. In your case I suspect that you are concerned / stressed about something. This can be something external to your person, such as money or your grades. Or it can be something internal, such as a conflict (unmet expectations) between a subconscious definition of yourself (identity) and your environment.It can also be all of the above; the conflict between how you define yourself and how you perceive your environment can lead to an insecurity - not so much about who you are, but about whether you are suffering lack or loss as a result of an environment which you perceive as insufficient. This, in turn, can have a knock-on effect: you may focus more on your other shortcomings (such as money) or find that this insecurity is affecting your academic work (which you are more than capable of doing, and you know it)… thus creating more tension / stress.And because it’s so difficult to consciously articulate such a problem to yourself, you are unable to find an appropriate emotional outlet."
911,"How do you form a hypothesis, since you haven't done any testing and don't have any test results yet?You base yourself on existing knowledge.Just because for an hypothesis (as a general rule) to be validated it should have predictive ability (of events that are otherwise unpredictable) doesn’t mean that you're starting from the ground up.Although he wasn’t the first to say it, the saying “If I have seen further, it is by standing on the shoulders of giants” is often attributed to the great physicist, Isaac Newton.And so it is: you start with the available data and the pre-existing scientific theories, and speculate onwards from there. So for example, when Charles Darwin was writing his “On the Origin of Species” - the book we know refer to as the basis of modern day evolutionary theory, he wasn’t working in a vacuum. In fact, his grandfather - Erasmus Darwin - wrote a book in which he came pretty close to predicting natural selection, and said this:“Would it be too bold to imagine, that in the great length of time, since the earth began to exist, perhaps millions of ages before the commencement of the history of mankind, would it be too bold to imagine, that all warm-blooded animals have arisen from one living filament, which the great first cause endued with animality, with the power of acquiring new parts, attended with new propensities, directed by irritations, sensations, volitions, and associations; and thus possessing the faculty of continuing to improve by its own inherent activity, and of delivering down those improvements by generation to its posterity, world without end!”Zoonomia (1794)Science grows over time. Each hypothesis takes just a small step forward, only one step up the stairs, in the darkness (that’s why it takes decades and centuries for science to move forward - otherwise we’d have already figured out all of this stuff back in the stone age). And the best thing about these stairs? You’ve already climbed a few, and you hardly ever fall down. Most of the time, if you’re wrong, you just try out a new hypothesis, and another one, and another one, until you get it right.Then you drink champagne, or beer, or a coca cola, and you go on speculating from there. One step at a time."
912,"Consequences can vary from site to site. But if there were real consequences, trolls would not continue to whomp around the web. Outside of the internet, you could be the one straw that broke the camel’s back, so to say. Yours could be the last words that someone reads before they take their own life. I am not saying you are responsible, because each person is responsible for their own actions, but if you did not have the screen to hide behind, how would you feel? If you told a person on the street that they are worthless and should be dead, and they immediately stepped in front of a bus, how do you think that would affect you? Could you live with the memory of seeing someone die in front of you?Frankly, I believe if you cannot walk up to a random stranger on the street and say such things to them, you should not be saying it on the internet. If that is not enough reason for you to control your craving to verbally abuse people, I doubt anything will.Thanks for the A2A."
913,"Over 10,000 RTI activists already murdered in India. Those were fighting against corrupt practices of Politicians and Bureaucrats. Lakhs sit back at home silently after being attacked or threatened.I know you won’t agree, In every state, city, town there are lots of illegal/criminal activities going on. Do one thing go to police station and file a F.I.R. against them, come back here and tell me:Whether this Desh Bhakt(Preferably go to BJP ruled state) police filed your F.I.R. or not?If Yes, What action they took?Have they arrested the accused?Have police stopped that illegal/criminal activity?Check whether that criminal don’t start threatening you or your family?If they threaten or Attack you, what police is doing?Or maybe police will ask you to keep quiet and sit at home silently.When 4 years old Gudiya was raped by neighbor in Delhi and her father went to police station with her to file a complaint, he was given Rs.2000/- by police constable to go away and no complaint was filed by police. Then he called AAP office and they protested after which F.I.R. was registered.Delhi police already arrested 12 AAP MLA’s on fake charges. I don’t defend them?but, do you think all criminals are in AAP which is just a 3 year old party. No criminals are in Lalu Party, Nitish Party, Malayam Party, Mayawati Party, Owaesi Party, Shiv Sena…how many MLA/M.P. of these parties have been arrested by our patriotic Modi government.CBI raid on Magsaysay award winner Kejriwal office, why not on Mulayam, Lalu, Mayawati, Yedi, Patnaik, Sheila Dikshit, Sonia Gandhi, Robert Vadra, Chitambram, Manmohan Singh, Rahul Gandhi??? Why why why only kejriwal??Congress/Mayawati/Lalu did so much corruption, why their leaders are not going to jail—-Try to think sometimes patiently, without just ignoring other person and considering him fool because he is not saying or writing what you want to read or listen.Why you have started hating Kejriwal more than Sonia, Mayawati, Laalu..?? why, not even a single corruption, murder, riot charge on him.Many won’t understand because they don’t know that they are communal, they don’t know they are blindly in love with a party and can’t see above that. (You may say some for me, but I never saw so many MLA arrested, ACB taken from Delhi Govt, So many bills null and void)We all know AAP is winning in Punjab easily and in Punjab, police will be in control of AAP. It won’t be like delhi that Kejriwal files F.I.R. against Sheila Dikshit and Moily and no action is taken. LG won’t do everything null and void. BJP/Congress etc are scared of this and daily arresting AAP MlA’s on laughable charges. It wont be a surprise if they murder someone to save their skin (Respect/Reputation/Chants)One more thing that I feel, Kejriwal is leaving delhi and will become Chief Minister of Punjab. Shisodia will look after delhi.Thank You"
914,"Thanks for the A2A.I need to go into this with a disclaimer: I'm an edge user and I work with lots and lots of other edge users, my perspective is, at the very least, odd. That being said, here are the big disadvantages as I see them:Support costs for apple products are generally higher. The labor pool of qualified apple technicians is smaller, the training to service apple equipment is less broadly available and because of that, qualified personnel can charge a premium for their services. There are fewer off the shelf options for component repair, no competition for parts to drive cost of replacement parts down... From a support perspective, Apple has to deliver world class support themselves, because no one else is able to do it for them.Considerably less enterprise support. I manage enterprise support organizations. When we say that connecting your MacBook to the company VPN isn't supported, we mean it. We mean that no one on staff is trained on Apple products to know how to do it because out of tens of thousands of users out there, we don't have enough Mac users to justify the costs of maintaining an Apple product specialist on hand. We mean that even if something is technically possible, no one knows how to do it, and if you managed to get it to work once, when the engineers made changes to the environment, they didn't test to see if the change broke Mac compatibility before they implemented it. Enterprise support for Macs is poor for a bevy of reasons that have nothing to do with whether or not Macs are good products. Macs, in general, are available for a narrower subset of use cases than PCs. There isn't currently a dual Xeon MacPro workstation that I can hand to an engineer or 3D artist. There isn't a $200 Apple netbook that I can hand to my cousin's ten year old either. Apple only produces mid-range products at the high end of the Performance / $ spectrum.In general, Macs have higher Cost vs Performance. Dollar for Dollar, you can usually outperform (computationally) an Apple product with a non-apple product. Apple lags behind the technology curve and is slow to bring new hardware to market. HP and Lenovo already have Haswell-EP workstations in the market, but the MacPro is clunking along on Ivy Bridge chips. Broadwell-M processors will hit in non-Apple hardware Q4 of 2014 but you won't be able to buy a MacBook with a Broadwell chip in it until 1st half 2015. The new AMD Firepro workstation GPUs can be purchased today, but you can't purchase a Mac that has them built in, and you can't upgrade your current gen MacPro to use them. Considerably less customizable for specific use cases. Do you need a Xeon powered workstation with Nvidia Quadro GPUs to leverage Quadro based accelerations to your work? Sorry... Apple doesn't feel like they need to make a product for you. In fact, Apple no longer feels like they need to support any CUDA based technologies, so, if you're one of those people who likes their CUDA workflows... Apple doesn't want to make products for you anymore. There are other use cases as well where Apple has just decided they don't want to make hardware for people who have those needs.No overclocking. Intel and AMD are both onboard with the notion of manufacturing chips that have the ability to be pushed by people who need the performance. Apple doesn't put those chips in their products. Only one aesthetic choice: The Apple look. Do you want to look under the hood of your computer while you're working and see all of that technology at work while you do? Apple doesn't want you to see under the hood. No windowed cases for you. Are you excited by the look of custom loop liquid cooling systems? Brightly polished nickle plated copper heat pipes? Hand bent acrylic hardlines? Custom sleeved cabling? Color coded components? LEDs? Apple does not provide these aesthetic (and performance enhancing) options. (Okay, the LEDs don't enhance performance... except maybe the light path between the audio section of the motherboard and the rest of the board... or the LED I/O panel that makes it easier to find ports when plugging things in under your desk...)Apple makes good products. For 70% of the market (maybe more) their hardware is just fine. It's nice, well engineered hardware to do the things that it's designed to do. For many users, it's a good option. It's important to remember (after reading this lengthy rant) that for every reason not to buy a Mac there are also reasons that a person should buy a Mac. It will always depend on your specific needs. This is not an attempt at a balanced answer weighting pros-vs-cons of apple hardware, it's a list of things that you can't do with Apple hardware and it isn't exhaustive by any means. If Apple has chosen to build a product that fits your needs, it's worth considering if it is the right choice."
915,"I vividly remember this incident,I was around 3 and half at time. My mother was completing her higher studies in her last semester. During the exams my aunt(Mother's Sister) used to baby sit me. As usual on the last day of my mom's exams,(While baby sitting)my aunt made me play with the Dry Battery Cells. The game was to roll the cell to and fro from my side to her's while we were sitting on the floor. Everything was going well,My naive aunt was doing a great job and I was thoroughly engaged.(The battery cell was exactly like this) But suddenly I realized,Mom is taking just too much time than usual. That was the moment of disaster,I can't really explain that moment,I took the cell(I was playing with) and threw it aiming at her head shot. It hit her hard,really really hard just above her left eye. The shot made her forehead bleed. She rushed to the hospital and got 3 stitches. The mark is still there just above her left eyebrows, It constantly rememinds me that memory. And I don't think I will ever forgot that moment!"

It is obvious that majority of Muslims must have voted him during LS Elections' 2014.2.) Also in J&K Muslims have majority and there BJP got 25/87 Seats. Hence it is now clear that Muslims also like Mr. Narendra Modi.3.) A 12-year-old Muslim girl, studying in Class 6 of a Mira Road school in Mumbai, secured the first place in a Bhagwad Gita competition organised by the International Society for Krishna Consciousness (ISKCON). courtesy: The Hindu3.) Also Prime Minister Narendra Modi praised Islam for emphasizing the importance of education.""The Quran mentions the word 'ilm' 800 times. It is among the most repeated words after Allah. This is the importance of knowledge in the religion,"" Modi told an audience comprising the high commissioners of Saarc countries and envoys of Muslim.4.)

918,"This advice comes from my dad who was a Corrections Officer for 25 years. I have never been locked up and have never been in trouble with the law.Don’t accept any “gifts” when you arrive. Sometimes you won’t have everything you need such as shower shoes, soap, a toothbrush, snacks; whatever. Some inmates will try to leave you “gifts” to hold something over you. They’ll say that since they did something for you, it’s time for you to do ANYTHING for them.Continue your education. Give yourself a chance to learn something that can be used to help you when you get out. Go to college, learn a trade, get your GED. That will be a good chance to keep you from reoffending. It could also reduce your time in jail if they see you are doing your best to become a model citizen.Be ready to fight. My dad said that prison is a whole different ballgame. You have to fight to protect your food, because someone might not like your skin color, and more.Nobody is your friend behind bars. You will be in there with con artists, rapists, armed robbers, murderers, addicts, drug dealers, and worse. They will exploit you to get themselves ahead.Keep your mouth shut. Don’t tell anybody anything about what you did, don’t ask what they did, and don’t snitch. Rats don’t last long in prison and they get discovered really quickly.EDIT: STOP COMMENTING ON MY ANSWER AS IF I’M THE ONE GETTING LOCKED UP. I AM NOT GOING TO JAIL. I DID NOT ASK THIS QUESTION.

I love watching this movie. Who won't ?? Don't you feel this is the dream.2. The Duff - this is totally highschool love sort of movie, damn cute to handle !3. The Notebook - Mostly everyone would have seen the movie. No doubt about it.4. Enchanted - A cute princess story who enters into real world and falls in love with a “not a believer of love” type person. Mesmerizing. Again yeah not practical but I do believe you need to keep your common sense out before watching these romantic movies. That's why I watch them alone ;)5. Just like heaven - Amazing story of how a guy falls for a spirit and at the end she comes back to life just because he kisses her and her brain activates and heart starts beating. Again please don't judge me. Watch the movie it's rom-com, you will love it too (I can atleast hope for it ;) )6. Starstruck - Perfect love story of a girl not so interested in some superstar singer but falls for the exact same guy ! But still its that Teenage love story. The superstar who falls for a common girl.7. Endless love - this particular movie brings me goosebumps every time I watch it. How people meet someone like this like where ? I want to know that place !!Me : I want to have a love story like this but my love life sucks !Inner me : First you need to have one then it sucks ! ( Rolling my eyes )But this movie, it's amazing !This amazing lines is what the movie about , if you have found one don't lose the electricity :)we all should always remember this lines, Love should not be one of them ❤️8.

He won but I didn't lose.Anyway enjoy the lines...."
920,"A2A.McGill's admissions process is quite formulaic. The admissions committee value grades and standardized test scores above all else. If you are, for instance, a Canadian student, then your high school grades will dictate whether or not you will be accepted.However, since you are an international student, your country of origin will also be a factor during admissions. A Chinese student will be assessed using a different metric than that of a French student.With that being said, since you are an A student, I think you have that front covered. A couple of B's won't necessarily hurt you as long as your grades show a trend of steady improvement. It is extremely important that you score high (>90%) on STEM courses, which will be weighted more heavily since you want to apply to CS, which is under the Faculty of Science.Sadly, McGill does not place as much emphasis on extracurriculars as other universities so your research papers may not play a significant role in admissions. However, do include it in your application as it certainly won't hurt.Remember that McGill's acceptance rate is rather high (>40%) so the odds are in your favor. They tend to give you the benefit of the doubt, and let your time at McGill determine if you will successfully graduate.Good luck."
921,"The decision that there was a trinity was decided by a meeting of Catholic bishops and others in 325 AD. Here is a quote about the Council of Nicea:The Council of Nicea took place in AD 325 by order of the Roman Emperor Caesar Flavius Constantine. Nicea was located in Asia Minor, east of Constantinople. At the Council of Nicea, Emperor Constantine presided over a group of church bishops and other leaders with the purpose of defining the nature of God for all of Christianity and eliminating confusion, controversy, and contention within the church. The Council of Nicea overwhelmingly affirmed the deity and eternality of Jesus Christ and defined the relationship between the Father and the Son as “of one substance.” It also affirmed the Trinity—the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit were listed as three co-equal and co-eternal Persons.So a Roman Emperor (Constantine) decided 1,691 years ago what you will believe as a Christian. For me that is too much of a stretch-it has no meaning in my life.Your beliefs are not my business, or anyone else’s so don’t worry about what a few men living in the Bronze Age decided."
922,"THE BENEFITS OF MEDITATION, AND HOW TO ADD IT TO YOUR DAILY ROUTINE.Meditation is to the mind what fitness is to the body. It’s a technique to train and improve the mind as exercise trains the body. Like exercises, there are numerous meditation techniques. However, most are categorised as the below:1) CONCENTRATION MEDITATION: Concentration meditation involves focusing on a single point. This could entail following the breath, repeating a single word or mantra, staring at a candle flame or listening to a repetitive sound. Since focusing the mind is challenging, a beginner might meditate for only a few minutes and then work up to longer durations.In this form of meditation, you simply refocus your awareness on the chosen object of attention each time you notice your mind wandering. Rather than pursuing random thoughts, you simply let them go. Through this process, your ability to concentrate improves.2) MINDFULNESS MEDITATION: Mindfulness meditation encourages the practitioner to observe wandering thoughts as they drift through the mind. The intention is not to get involved with the thoughts or to judge them, but simply to be aware of each mental note as it arises.Through mindfulness meditation, you can see how your thoughts and feelings tend to move in particular patterns. Over time, you can become more aware of the human tendency to quickly judge an experience as good or bad, pleasant or unpleasant.WHY MEDITATE?Benefits of meditating have been proven to include:- More happy feelings - Less stress- Deep relaxation- Lower blood pressure- Improved blood circulation- Lower heart rate- Less perspiration- Slower respiratory rate- Lower anxiety- Lower blood cortisol levelsThe main benefit, and aim, of meditation however is to maintain a calm mind and sense of inner harmony.HOW TO START MEDITATING:1) Sit or lie comfortably. You may even want to invest in a meditation chair or cushion.2) Close your eyes.3) Make no effort to control the breath; simply breathe naturally.4) Focus your attention on the breath and on how the body moves with each inhalation and exhalation.5) Notice the movement of your body as you breathe. Observe your chest, shoulders, rib cage, and belly. Simply focus your attention on your breath without controlling its pace or intensity. If your mind wanders, return your focus back to your breath.6) Maintain this meditation practice for three to five minutes to start. Aim to increase this and ideally be up to ten minutes within the first month.7) Schedule in daily, and make sure you are not disturbed.Ian David WorthingtonCreator, Owner and Coach at GymWolfPT.com"
923,"The popular hypothesis on the expanding universe is partially summed up by the Big Rip (Big Rip) conjecture.We know that the universe is expanding. What is new is that there seems to be an acceleration to this expansion. If so, it will lead to some astounding dynamic events in the universe. As described in the Wiki article and in many other sites on the internet, at some point in the far future the expansion rate will become greater than the gravitational attraction of the galaxies, which will begin to move away from each other. Then galaxies themselves will diffuse and spread apart, then solar systems (which will be long dead by then), followed by stellar remnant disintegration, planetary disintegration, molecular disintegration.What happens next is still open to conjecture, but we can do a thought experiment and come up with a pretty good answer.The accelerating expansion will then pull electrons from nuclei and pull protons and neutrons from the nucleus.Now things become interesting. All the neutrons will decay to protons, electrons, and anti-neutrino within a brief time, leaving protons as the next target.But what happens when the expansion rate becomes greater than the strong nuclear force? Well, we know that the proton is made up of three quarks (two up and one down). We also know that quarks cannot exist in isolation. So what happens? The increasing expansion of the universe becomes greater than the strong nuclear force and pulls the quarks apart. This takes a great deal of energy. Where does this energy come from?As the quarks are pulled apart, they combine with virtual quark particles from the vacuum energy and form mesons; quark and anti-quark pairs. Normally, the mesons would decay very quickly (10−8𝑡𝑜10−1610−8to10−1610^{-8}to 10^{-16}) seconds, but the rate of expansion pulls the quark anti-quark pair of the meson apart before it can decay. This produces two more mesons, which produce four mesons, which produce eight, and we have an exponentially increasing creation of matter.Where does the energy come from to create all this matter? One proposed form of dark energy is that it is equivalent to the vacuum energy of space, that is, virtual particles. And dark energy is proposed as the energy of acceleration.So now we see that dark energy is being converted to matter in the form of quark anti-quark mesons and thus the amount of dark energy is reduced. If dark energy is reduced, so then is the acceleration of the universe. Eventually, we have complete conversion of dark energy to meson matter. But the expansion continues and meson matter continues to form.We can think of the initial expansion rate of the universe as inertia. The continued formation of meson matter then begins to slow down the expansion rate. But since we have an exponential growth of meson matter, the expansion rate will slow down rapidly.When the expansion rate slows enough, the mesons will then have time to decay into photons (gamma), electrons, positrons, neutrinos, and anti-neutrinos. The electrons and positrons will combine and decay into two gamma photons. So the resulting universe will consist of photons, neutrinos, and anti-neutrinos.What happens next is completely unknown and would require some clever and difficult calculations to arrive at an answer. Will the resulting expansion rate become negative? Will the significantly increased mass-energy of the universe contribute to a negative expansion (shrinking)?Lots of good things to think about here.Cheers!"
924,It's too early to answer that question. Development is a very broad and slow thing. It needs time to get analysed. Wait for few more months to see the better picture. Don't miss understood announcements with Development. Every ruling party try to do something to remain in power. Making announcements and applying it are two different things. So have some patience and ask this question again after 6-7 months. You surely will get answers with stats and facts. Now is not the right time.
925,"They do have adverse side effects when they’re prescribed incorrectly. It’s a myth that homeopathic medicines do not have side effects. [1]I was once prescribed Lachesis 1M for a left sided headache but unfortunately ended up having a severe aggravation for a week - left upper eyelid started drooping (ptosis) along with weakness of the entire left side of the body followed by fever and skin problems. When all the adverse symptoms subsided, the original left sided headache was also gone for quite a long time!In a way, these side effects are common (just like the mild fever and soreness after vaccination) but can be totally avoided with measured dosages, potency and antidotes.Footnotes[1] Medscape Log In"
926,"Choice of broker depends on a number of factors. Do you want research? Low commissions? Low borrow rates? A reliable trading platform? Option analytics? How often are you going to trade? How many shares do you trade? Does the broker offer a paper trading account, good charting, good technical analysis? Real time news? What are the data fees, if any? Do they have reasonable borrow rates for hard to borrow stocks?Think Or Swim has superb option analytics.If you know what you are doing, you trade relatively infrequently and you are simply seeking the best commission structure, free trades are available at many brokers.If you trade large blocks of low priced shares, you'd be better off at a fixed fee broker like Tradeking @ $4.95 plus they have an account opening offer of $1,000 in free commissions (for trades in first 60 days) if you fund an account with $5,000.Optionshouse also charges $4.95 per trade.Merrill Edge offers up to 30 free trades a month.And there are others. Google ""Free Trades Broker"". Check the fine print for add'l charges (cancellation fees, modified orders, etc).If you want to scale in and out of positions, say 500, 1,000 shares, etc., Interactive Brokers charges a 50 cent commission per 100 shares ($1 minimum charge per trade) So five trades of 200 shares is the same $5 commission as one trade of 1,000 shares. Option commissions are approx 75 cts per contract (less if closing out 1 to 5 ct premiums) with free option assignment and exercise. You sometimes get rebates for providing liquidity as well.The short answer? It depends on what your needs are.For a Barrons review of brokers, see:Best Online Brokers: Fidelity Wins in Barron’s 2016 Survey"

928,"It tells the capacity of the engine the car has.For starters : 1 Litre = 1000 cc (cc means Cubic Centimeters or cm^3)So a 1.2L car is:1.2×1000= 1200 ccLikewise a 1.4 L car has a 1400cc engine;and so on.Also note that if a 1.2L car has a 4 cylinder engine, it means each cylinder's capacity is 1200÷4 = 300 ccVolume of a cylinder is :(π(D^2)h)÷4where D is the diameter of the cylinder called Bore Diameter and h is the height of the cylinder called Stroke Length.Thus when you calculate the volume of each cylinder of a 4 cylinder 1200cc car, using the above formula by measuring the bore and stroke yourself you'll end up getting 300cc or some no. very close to 300cc since π isn't an absolute no.Now for the technical part :How does that matter?Well the performance of an engine (Horsepower, Torque, Acceleration, etc.) depends upon how much fuel it can burn when the Piston inside the cylinder reciprocates once; i.e. when it moves from the topmost point of the cylinder called Top dead center (T. D. C.) to the lowermost point of the cylinder called the Bottom dead center (B.D.C.).Here's an image I sourced from the Internet :But there's a catch. You can't add an infinite amount of fuel because you need air to burn this fuel, lest the fuel remains unburnt and comes out of the exhaust and deposits on the tailpipe (The greasy deposits which you might have seen especially on tailpipes of obsolete 2-stroke two wheelers is this unburnt fuel).Thus, to get more performance you need to burn more fuel and to burn more fuel you need to suck in a lot of air into that cylinder. One simple way of doing this is to have a larger capacity cylinder which will have a higher capacity to hold air and thus can burn more fuel giving a better performance.However, be warned that a bigger engine also means that it will be less fuel efficient. Since it has to burn a definite amount of fuel to keep running it will consume more fuel even at low speeds when you don't really need that performance.Other ways are also prevalent to increase performance but this is the most primitive way of doing this.However newer ways like turbocharging or increasing the compression ratio by using direct injection (D. I.) are far better methods because they do not compromise much on fuel efficiency.Thus Bigger engine = Better engine doesn't really hold true nowadays with improved technologies that has made smaller engines more powerful while at the same time being fuel efficient!"

930,"Yes.This is not fiction/non-proven(like telekinesis or telepathy) stuff. Dream controlling is real, and is studied by scientists.The term for it is Lucid Dreaming.The thing is, while you are dreaming, your brain simulates the reality. But it is not very good at doing it. However, most people still can't differentiate between dreams and reality because after all, its your brain that's tricking you, you can hardly help it.So, you use clues to get out of your minds traps.Simply put, there are many things that happen in a weird way in dreams. One example is, while you are dreaming, if you look at your hands, you will never see 10 fingers! (When I lucid dream, I usually see 2 pinkies, and sometimes my hands have so many fingers that I lose count while counting them.)If you try to read text in your dream, shift your focus away, and look again at the text, the text is very likely to change.If there is a tube-light shining, or a phone ringing, your actions of switching off the light, or picking up the phone will very likely cause no change, and the light will continue to shine, the phone will continue to ring.There are many other clues.So, if you make a habit of looking at your hands and counting your fingers every 20 minutes or so, your brain will start performing the action subconsciously. Then one night, you will end up looking at your hand, while you are dreaming. And you will count less or more fingers than you have. That means you are in a dream, and you know you are dreaming.Once you know you are dreaming, you can exert control over your surroundings, and even the way your dream progresses, but that is not for the absolute beginner.With practice, you can even personify your subconscious, and talk to it! It will tell you your deepest desires, it will let you relive the best moments of your life and much more. (ofcourse theres stuff like changing your surroundings, flying, having sex that you can do, but it gets boring after a while. Talking to your subconscious is really difficult, and is an enlightening experience)Lucid Dreaming can be used for many purposes including practicing things, creating your mind palace, solving problems and deriving creative inspiration.If you wish to read more about the topic, simply Google ""Lucid Dreaming"". There are loads of good websites dedicated to the topic, and you will find a handful of research papers.In response to the question posted in comments:Have you ever done this? How far have you gotten? How long did it take you? The answers to your questions are at the bottom.The following is how I got started with Lucid Dreaming.This post is long, and I am a bad writer, so please bear with me :(Let me tell you my story, but first you need to learn some trivia.Human sleep is a peculiar phenomenon, in which the brain simulates the environment, and you do your job. Dreams are very imperfect, can change suddenly but seem very real from the inside.Human sleep has many phases, each one has a distinguishable brainwave frequency band. The phase in which you dream is called Rapid Eye Movement (REM), and as the name suggests, your eyeballs move when you are dreaming (you can look at a persons eyes and tell if he is dreaming or not)While in REM, your brain puts you into a temporary paralysis, so that you don't end up enacting your actions in real life (like if you walk in your dream, you wont end up walking in real life)This is called sleep paralysis.Now, my story.I used to have weird dreams, and some repeating nightmares. As a kid I was always interested in weird stuff like hypnotism, UFOs, telepathy, telekinesis and the likes, but had zero knowledge about anything.So, my school library recruited a hobbyist librarian, whom I became friends with, and seeing my interests he handed me a book on UFO and alien abductions.Turned out, the book was not filled wi..."
931,"If you can pull it off, it can be the best thing that can ever happen to you.To answer your question, the secret for us was simple, “You dont think too much about it.”I stayed in a long distance relationship for over 3 years as I was in the US and my girlfriend was in India. We had been dating for just over a year and a half before I left for the US.I think the biggest challenge we faced like everyone else was lack of communication considering the time difference which was about 11 hours. I would wake up to her Facetime calls and they would just be 5 minutes long on an average. But those 5 minutes every day for 3 years went a long way for us. There were days when both of us would be busy, making it extremely difficult for us to talk but for the most part we made it a point that we talked for those 5 minutes.And I think that was it, there were no trust issues or insecurities between the two of us. Neither was there ever a thought of us not being together, even when we did not know if our families would approve of our relationship if and when we decide to get married ( yes, coming from India, family approval will always have extreme importance, atleast it did for us ). To add more context, for the first couple of years I was not even sure if I would be going back to India or staying in the US. Infact, a few of our friends asked us individually if we would want to stay in a relationship considering how easily they break apart for a lot of people. Inspite of these and a lot of other things, we realised the best way is to take things as they come and not dwell too much over it. Once you accept that, it will become a lot easier.And beyond that, I guess both of us got really lucky to have found each other (that is a story for another time, though) and that in the end it worked out really well for us.We completed 6 years of our relationship few months back. We got married almost a year back. We are closer than ever before, we never fight, (apart from the usual fight that starts with ‘me forgetting the towel on the bed’ and ends at ‘her not managing her finances well’) and we never take each other for granted (well I do sometimes. but she makes sure I realise that every single time.)But yeah, thats it! Think if you truly love someone you will figure out a way against all odds. Have faith.Hope that helps!P.S: thats us in the picture.Edit 1: Thank you everyone for the response. Its not a big deal, honestly. It is like losing weight, if you are too conscious about it, you will give in someday, but if you take it up as a part of your daily routine, its not a huge deal, really.

932,"My answer Where did you ever get this crazy idea from? I am also saying that if you can sit back with a bold enough face to ask people to give you $5 million dollars US, just like that, you don't deserve even $1. There are a number of these insane questions appearing on Quora, and I believe its a small number of people asking the same crazy questions and changing up the wording to let it appear that many people are of this mind set. First it was $1 million ,now it has ‘sky rocketed” to $5 million. It is my belief that you are very idle to think that someone who work or invest or even win the lotto would make you an instant millionaire. I have seen people who are physically challenged working. I mean people in wheel chairs, people missing an arm or a leg, or both, people with limited sight, or no sight at all and worse. I suggest that if you have so much time on your hand to idle, try start a small business .It could a brick and mortar one, or one on the internet, and you would stand a better chance, if you were to ask for funding to expand your business, rather than asking for free hands out. I would be embarrassed to even to think of, let alone posting a question like this. Finally If you are dreaming, wake up."
933,"Hongkong did not decline. It went home!Before 1997, the Hongkong entertainment industry was the Chinese entertainment industry. Talents from all over China and the Chinese diaspora fled to Hongkong and settled there—from producers and directors to actors and singers—refugees of the Sino-Japanese War, the Chinese Civil War, the Communist Revolution, the Great Leap Backwards, the Cultural Revolution, the Vietnam War, and the anti-Chinese pogroms in Malaya, which became Malaysia and Indonesia.Entertainers worked very hard, usually both singing and making movies. There were many sources of funding, initially from the underworld laundering money, but as the industry itself matured and the economy in general grew, the ecosystem grew. While Mainland China was still figuring out its life in general and Taiwan was under martial law, Hongkong represented the Chinese world.The British were very hands-off in regulating the industry. In fact, the most significant thing they did was enforcing movie subtitles in proper English, which helped with its distribution worldwide.Within a decade of the rétrocession of Hongkong to China, the industry players all looked north for bigger budgets and bigger audiences. The logic was simple: same amount of work, much bigger return.China had finally grown up, and it was time for the Chinese film industry to go home.The side effect is that the remaining entertainers in Hongkong are not world class anymore, so they don't get much attention outside of Hongkong. The ones that make it big move North or abroad."
934,"If you don’t understand how Trump could win before Nov. 8th, I totally understand you.If you still don’t understand how Trump won now, you have a serious arrogance and ignorance problem.I would assume you, the reader to this answer, live in a urban area in either Northeast or the West Coast, college educated, a typical left-wing supporter and advocator for your entire life.That’s nice. You work in the office with HVAC on 24/7/365. You go to gym after work, watching news from CNN or NBC on the treadmill. Then you eat your dinner out somewhere with a friend, probably not cooking at home. Sometimes you fly between NYC/Boston and LA/SFO for business. When you look down from the plane window and see those endless farmlands and mountains in the midwest, you are thinking “I can’t imagine living a life down there.”When you saw Trump won, you were shocked. Holy shit! There’s not a single person around me who supports Trump, how could he win?That’s where the problem is. You are living in a completely different world than those Trump supporters.When you refuel your car, have you ever wondered where the gas comes from, if not imported? Who drilled the oil for you?When you charge your phone, have you ever wondered where the electricity comes from? Who dug the coal to power the plant?When you shop in the supermarket, have you ever wondered where the fresh vegetables and fruits come from? Who drove the truck all the way from California to New York to deliver those goods?Those are the people who support Donald Trump. Have you ever talked to any one of them?Without you, they can still feed themselves, but without them, you will be starved to death. You don’t know how to grow crops, and you dare not to kill a chicken.So now how could you despise them as “uneducated redneck racists”?When they watch the news, even when watching Fox News, the camera is always on the big cities far away from them. They are ignored, as if they don’t exist in this country. No one pays attention to them, and no one speaks for them, until Donald Trump.They could drive a truck for $8k a month 20 years ago working 60 hours a week, but now the illegal immigrants are willing to do it at $3k. They lost their jobs.They could work in a factory for $4k a month 20 years ago, but now the job goes to China and Mexico when the workers there make $500 a month. They lost their jobs.You can’t urge a 40-year-old man with a high school diploma having a family to raise to go to college again and learn programming or investment banking. He can’t and he can’t afford.You also can’t say in 10 years robots are doing the job for them and they should just vanish because their minds and skills don’t follow the era.They are human beings. They are also lovely nice people. They don’t hate you. They work hard so you can live a comfortable life. Why do you hate them? Why do you label them as racist deplorables and xenophobic bigots without even knowing how hard their lives are?When they are losing jobs and falling into poverty, they don’t know what to do. They stay at home and turn on the TV and see Obama and Hillary speaking on ABC News: “The biggest problem our society now facing is climate change.”They may voted for Obama 8 years ago and hoped him to bring change to their life, but they could only sigh when they see this. So they switch to Fox News and see Donald Trump speaking on his rally in Detroit, MI: “We need to rebuild our inner cities, we need to bring jobs back.” They follow him and say: “YES! Let’s make America great again!”When they saw Obama visiting NYC after hurricane Sandy in 2012, but was playing golf when the devastating flood in Louisiana destroyed thousands of homes this summer, they knew they were forgotten.However, when they saw Trump visiting Louisiana after the flood, a state that he didn’t need to campaign at all, they knew someone actually cared for them.If you are them, who will you vote for?They are the silent majorities. They live in your flyover states. They don’t care about LGBT or BLM. They are not racist or homophobic. They just want jobs to feed their families.Please throw away your arrogance and start to care about those people. They are Americans too. They might be more American than you are, since many of your clients and customers are foreign.They have no methods to let you hear them. All the medias don’t speak for them, all the celebrities don’t pay attention to them. All the career politicians don’t represent them. The only weapon they have are their ballots. They vote to knock you out of your utopia. That’s the power of democracy. That’s why democracy is great. It never ignores anyone.If you believe your value is progressive and right, you need to help them getting out of their trouble first. You can’t blame and mock them. It will only push them away from you even more.Trump has been a democrat longer than republican in his life. He has married 3 times, agrees with progressive income tax, has been pro-choice in most of his life and pro-LGBT all the time. The only hardcore conservative thing I can think of him is anti-alcohol. However, he could still defeat 16 truly conservative republican candidates and won more votes in the primaries than anyone else in the history. This has already proven that the silent majorities are much more tolerant now on social issues. They just want someone to fix the economy for them.Now it’s your chance to work with them, help them under the 4 years of Trump’s presidency. Stop protesting and introspect yourself. Isn’t your arrogance and ignorance that brought Trump to the White House?"

938,"A friend of mine works in the Army Medical Corps. Which usually means she is a well paid nurse with a ‘Lieutenant’ attached to her name and she gets to know how differently men of different services hit on her. It also means that she is invited to officers only parties in fancy restaurants very often. One such ball was being hosted in a very expensive hotel in Kolkata and she had a +1 invite. Her not having a boyfriend and me being her best friend’s cousin automatically qualified me for the position. After being super excited for an hour and deciding on our itinerary she texted - “you cannot come”.WHAAAT??!!She expanded “only officers can come”. OK, I said. She added “only male officers can bring their civilian partners”.WHAAAT??!!I don’t exactly remember what I said after that but it should be along the lines of “those sexist grunts” or “oppressive custards” and probably “soldiers deserve respect too”. I’m not going to discuss the rigidness of hierarchy in the Indian Armed Services because I am deeply grateful for what they have done and know that this is probably what got us through all the wars with substandard equipment and zero preparedness. Ben might want to comment on this. But I feel bad for the 3,50,000 soldiers. Those men on the ground who march around with rifles, work for menial salaries and get subpar treatment. Maybe this is what keeps them under control. Maybe this is what enables them to execute suicidal orders or not think about Coups. Maybe this is discipline.But this is only an extension of the Indian Society at large which has rigid Hierarchies.The old look down on the young. Men look down on women. Rich look down on poor. The wise look down on the uninitiated. We are far from an egalitarian society. It means that my importance in society dictates how I treat you. Just because I hold an engineering degree I will reject any technical opinion from you and if you are 10 years old, I will take offence for your high degree of sarcasm. Is that fair? NO. But sadly, that is what I have been seeing my entire life. They are not obvious lines only visible under duress.Its sometimes based on privilege sometimes on the sense of achievement. But people want to maintain themselves high up in the social order to feed there sense of importance. Often it goes beyond that and controls the distribution of resources too. And Caste is just another way to do it.——————————————————————————————Its not just a linear hierarchical order - its a whole multi dimensional tree, with branches and leaves. Upper castes look down upon lower castes no doubt but even across a single level, different castes hold stereotypes and often do not intermarry. The Jats (a martial clan) are supposedly brash and Baniyas (tradesmen) are cunning, for example. People still cling on to their family names which are instant giveaways of their caste - Sharma for example is an obvious clergy name. And that only makes it easier for people to practice caste.At the receiving end of this system are Scheduled Castes and Tribes who form 20% of India’s population. Don’t get me wrong, any kind of prejudice (positive or negative) is wrong but its the SC/ST crowd which suffers the most. They are systematically segregated and oppressed. The worst part is that most of it is legal:Matrimonial classifieds are sorted by caste. We grow up watching this and do not take this seriously. We think its only natural to marry into your own caste. Because of this there is no intermingling or assimilation of the communities, reinforcing the divide. This legal structure is necessary because we need people to be identified by caste to avail them Reservations (Affirmative Action). Its like being stuck between a rock and a hard place. If you altogether outlaw caste based identity, the SC/ST will be completely overrun in the free market which would only enforce stereotypes about the poor while people still keep track of caste behind closed doors. This vicious cycle of stereotyping, oppression and deprivation will continue like it had before untouchability was abolished.But the primary reason Caste system still exists is public apathy. Reservations has caused a feeling of resentment among forward castes. They think that giving away seats in public sector jobs and higher education to the downtrodden is taking away the seats they deserve. This has only reinforced age old stereotypes. There are states in India where people have voluntarily given up caste names, only making use of it while seeking marriage alliances or applying for reservations. But those are results of bloody social revolutions while people in other states shamelessly carry on with their caste stereotypes.There are people who do not invite SC/ST inside their homes, who refuse to eat or drink from their place. There are people who would physically assault them over petty reasons. There are people who then call them “undeserved” for availing reservations and then there are people who believe there are biological differences between castes. These people lack common empathy and believe that what’s wrong with the oppressed is none of their business. They fail to realize that the lineage they are so proud of comes from stealing from these folks.Things are definitely changing - especially in the urban middle class crowd. But we still have a long way to go. Especially since there are too many people who hold the aforementioned views. There is an influx of ideas and people on the whole are growing more accepting. The caste hierarchy is being replaced by a consumeristic one which is still better than what we have.(suggested by User-13331186939230997432 :P)images from:Dalit Netwerk Nederland (DNN)"

Focus on bringing people into your business instead of charging people for anything and everythingIt’s hard to break into the world so I would suggest partnering with private schools, home school associations, and corporations dealing in international markets.SchoolsIf this were my business I would target small schools who have to find a third party to teach a foreign language. I would record enough videos and create a private playlist where the videos could only be seen on a website. To access the videos the school, teacher, or home schooling parent would have to pay you a monthly fee to access the videos.you could also offer to come an train the students in person.BusinessesI’m sure that there is a certain way to do this; however, I have not yet come across this in my research or experience. but many businesses invest in language programs to teach employees how to speak the language of whatever country they are going to operate in.Or, offer an online certification course for people who want to learn a language for professional reasons.But whatever you do… it’s important to have a social media presence. I personally recommend that you have a Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, and LinkedIn presence.Good luck and let me know if you have anymore questions,Walter"

Some give grants to athletes to support them as they train (and the level of the grant may depend on expected competition results, so winning a gold will increase the grant). Many will make most of their income from sponsorship, or appearance fees in other competitions, and winning a gold will increase those."

946,"There is reactance on both capacitor and inductor. It is the equivalent resistance in ac circuit. Their ac resistance depend on the frequency with opposite effect. Meaning as the frequency is increased, the capacitive reactance goes down while the inductive reactance goes up. The current in a capacitor is 90 deg leading the voltage while in inductor it is lagging. The reason of the reactance is the effect of continuous changing value of voltage applied and so the capacitor or inductor react to it. When peak voltage is reached the capacitor will tend to return the current the opposite direction to discharge while the inductor will conduct the same direction as the power source."
947,"Yes, that salary will get you in, but it won't go very far in terms of housing.  I don't know where the other posters are from who are saying it's easy, but finding housing in the Bay Area is hard almost regardless of what you make.   There is virtually no supply.  Yes, you will be able to afford something if you can find it, but that don't make it easy.  I'm a developer making an above average 6 figure salary in the Bay Area.  I just moved here in 2015.  For some reason, I think I should only have first world problems, not this crazy issue of having to scrap the bottom of the barrel just to find shelter.  To move here I had to put a deposit down on a place sight unseen, had to spend a $5K penalty on overlapping temporary housing, and give up my dog.  The place I moved into was far from ideal, it was the only place that met my minimum requirements of commute, cost, and school district.  I can't believe other people think this is normal.   Finding housing is only easy here relative to people making half of what you are, but in no way shape or form is it easy in absolute terms.  Apartments are rented out within 30 days of coming on the market and usually there's a waiting list even at the dumpy places.   That's unheard of almost anywhere else.  You are pretty much guaranteed you will have to make some major compromises to move here despite paying double what a lot of your neighbors will be.  You will have almost zero leverage with your landlord on any major issue.  Half the apartment listings on zillow are outdated.  When you go to them, they will tell you that is just a model, they don't have any current openings or some other bullshit, but will put you on a waiting list which is of no use since you have to sign a year lease with another place in the meantime.  They don't give a fuck about wasting your time, they don't have to.  Whatever supply is there, will go one way or another.  Your problems don't matter, they have 10 other people they can rent to if you don't want it. Forget about renting from individuals.  Half the listings will just have a crazy price and a single photo that may list all the things you're looking for, but don't ask for details, you take it or leave it as is.  Don't bother calling for more information or photos, unless you make all the effort, go to the place and immediately put down a deposit, you likely won't get it.  Its cut throat.Any other place in the country, you would likely be making at least $100K and have substantially more places that were both affordable and available.  I can't think of any area that could possibly be harder to find housing.  The one thing you have working for you is that you are a new grad.  You will find lots of others in your peer group that you can room with and not mind the dorm lifestyle so much and can save up a lot of money here.  Don't confuse that with making housing easy though."

949,"Why is salt water taffy candy imported in the United Kingdom?Is it? Never seen it anywhere. I only know the term from old Scooby Doo episodes.We don't have the word “Taffy” here, so if anyone wants taffy (rather than toffee or fudge), they would need to make it or import it.I asked an American living here what it was and I seem to remember she said it was softer than toffee, but not the same as fudge. If so, it might be different enough to import some, but probably not different enough to displace those two very popular types of traditional sweets*. If there aren't many people who want it, its unlikely to be economic to make it here. Especially if part of its appeal is in being a traditional american sweet.*I like bonfire toffee the best.

952,"“Cookie’s” life long lessons on the quest to be “prettier”/sharing my knowledge [rop]don’t be easy or slutty. That is the best way to avoiding being ugly. Be choosy. Everybody says they do it but they really don’t. You don’t want to be easy or you will be the last girl that any guy takes seriously or wants to marry, women will not trust you, your rep will proceed you more than that $10 bottle of Victoria’s Secret Love Spell perfume you bathe in. Think about how guys think about strippers & adult film stars. That’s not the kind of “pretty” you want to be, trust me. (Never allow yourself to be photographed nude!) it’s got/encompasses a lot of negative stuff. Hold out until you find Mr/(Miss) Right not Mr Right-Now. Think of your reputation as something valuable you can shape and affect with your behavior. It’s not cool to have three baby daddies. Virginity is pretty & can only be lost once.2. Watch your mouth. That means don’t curse (it’s not ladylike, it’s really uncouth), don’t lie (remembering what you lied about is a lot harder than keeping up with the truth), don’t spread rumors or hang out with people who gossip (if they speak in such a manner about another person you can guarantee they will have no reservations on “willful ignorance” on you). Don’t disrespect your parents. Make eye contact. Wear lipstick. Say funny and interesting things. Be memorable. Never be mean or rude or cruel, always be sympathetic/empathetic.3. You must do as best as you can with “what you got” (your appearance). Exercise and lose weight. Clothes that are flattering (color costs nothing more, don’t wear anything too tight, too short, too risqué/slutty, wear nice shoes). Do your makeup and nails. Choose an attractive hair color and style. Go for natural colors. Bleach blonde or black may not be intended for you. Colors should resemble those found in nature. Long hair is the best. Short or emasculated styles are unbecoming. Guys don’t want to date one-of-the-boys. Be as feminine as you can. Hirsute is normally negative. Choose trendy glasses or get contacts. Glasses are a fashion accessory same as carrying a statement bag or having cute shoes.4. Personal hygiene (shower or bathe at least once a day), wear deodorant & use soap; have clear skin, touch up your makeup several times a day (don’t let it smear), brush your teeth/floss/don’t have gross breath; wear clean clothes, toss out old worn shoes, pay attention to smelling good (lotion & perfume), style up your hair (but remember you don’t want to keep a guy waiting, you don’t want to be late everywhere & take 3 hours to get to “prettier,” so choose something simple/classic/realistic. Being late is never pretty), and do your makeup. Looks alone don’t make you pretty but no boy wants to kiss an ashtray so don’t smoke.5. Manners. Say please and thank you. Be gracious and kind. Be a graceful loser when it is your turn. Everyone has her triumphs and defeats.6. Don’t drink, smoke cigarettes or do drugs. Don’t be cheap. Don’t be over extravagant, overly political or overly religious, don’t be superficial, actually work on your education or career in earnest. Be honest, be as fair as you can, be firm, believe in yourself (you got this!). Remember moderation is key. No guys like nuns or zealots. Feeling pretty is acting the part. Remember you are acting a part. It isn’t the auditions for the “Clueless” movie. Dumb on purpose isn’t cute. Once you start acting don’t be acting superficial and so fake. It will start becoming natural behavior to act “prettier” (I say “prettier” because I believe in you. You are pretty!), & soon it won’t be a farce like you had expected. Be as sweet as you can, it’s endearing & making yourself memorable is important. Take on a nickname. Mine is “Cookie” because I have an interesting story to go with it and then people associate me with being sweet as well as original. Don’t rip off somebody else’s stories. Be an original! Be responsible always never reckless. It’s not pretty to be a badass. Guys don’t want to marry a felon. Don’t drink and drive, or even consider cheating (on a test, your boyfriend, etc), dishonesty is never pretty but a white lie won’t spare a friend the truth (“do these jeans make me look fat?”) don’t ask those kind of questions. Have beliefs. Take a stand on an issue or support a charity. Don’t be wishy washy (“I don’t know/I don’t care” guys get sick of that. They will find ways to avoid you if you let them pick every movie and restaurant). Be kind to animals, small children, people who have disabilities, senior cititzens, and veterans. Your parents know what is best for you so listen to them. Respectfully agree to disagree instead of arguing. People who like to argue because they get defensive aren’t pretty.7. Online behavior. Write as if you are literate. Don’t use shorthand for dirty phrases (“ffs, stfu, lmfao” etc make you seem low class, even if you will never meet someone in real life keep it  classy class act.) don’t cyber bully or spread gossip. People are judging you based on the few photos you have released (don’t ever send Nude pics!), so make sure they aren’t overly filtered, photoshopped, strategically angled pics that nobody would recognize you on the street but do pic naturally causally posed photos in good natural light that show you off the best). But I get a bad impression of a girl who doesn’t know basic grammar or spelling. Yes, pretty girls are literate!8. Fake it til you make it! If you employ all of my advice you will certainly be “prettier,” people will hold you in high esteem so you can check that low self esteem at the door. Low self esteem is ugly so is too much arrogance. Love yourself. You are your own most valuable advocate. Cut loose the toxic people in your life and hang out with other truly “prettier” individuals who thrive on encouraging each other not tearing them down. Being pretty much any just plastic surgery, Botox, or perfect teeth with a 24” waist. “Prettier” is a lifestyle change. You will falter once in awhile, mo one is perfect, but it will begin an entire new mindset when people react to-, and enforce, the positive behavior & changes you have made in your life. People will sit up and take notice. Enjoy your new found attention. Take a girl who has low confidence under your wing once you get this “prettier” thing down and passing the torch can be so satisfying! I’m passing it to you. What will you do with this knowledge??Sorry I went anon I knew this would be long & im trying to follow my own advice. Sometimes you just have to bear high school like the cross it is that everyone has to bear. I was SEVERLY bullied to the point of wanting to end my life back then. I am much better now. Leaving school (graduation of prep school & 3 stints in different colleges) was the best thing to happen to me. My journey to “prettiness” began when I found the Internet & ive never looked back. I live a fulfilling and rewarding life in real life and I find social media friendships incredibly gratifying and satisfying. Okay I will let you digest what I said. You don’t need to be considered pretty by anybody but yourself. Becoming “prettier” is a life long calling and vocation and every woman can do it. Never apologize for who you are. You are pretty. “Would a rose still smell as sweet by any other name?”"
953,"Animals by Pink Floyd (Animals (Pink Floyd album))Summary: One of the greatest albums of all time – not only a musical accomplishment to the highest degree, Animals is also a scathing criticism of the system that spawned it.tl;drAnimals is Pink Floyd’s greatest album. Such a statement will be forever refuted by those who fervently admire any of Pink Floyd’s other masterpieces; it’s arguable as to which album is the pinnacle of their success. Of course, it always comes down to a matter of opinion, but with this review the intention is to ardently argue Animals’ case; not only as the greatest Pink Floyd album, not only as one of the greatest records to have ever been made, but also as a triumphant and pessimistic reflection of the world’s descent into capitalism. The metaphorical value of ‘Dogs’, ‘Pigs’ and ‘Sheep’ are extensively ingrained in the criticism of the society which we take for granted, and Animals eloquently lays down a sweeping mockery of the system. In regards to the album’s position amongst Pink Floyd’s far-reaching discography,Animals is situated in a transient period; bearing marks of the band’s psychedelic and drug infused past, building on the largely tentative previous two albums, all while paving the way for The Wall’s concreted concept. It is because of this unique position that Animals holds as to why it is distinguishable from the Pink Floyd catalogue. It does not rely on musical oddities, vast soundscapes or experimentation; it is a composition perfect at its very core, from the pure genius of its songwriting, to a concept to beat all concepts in its relevance and societal value. Animals is, without a doubt, one of the greatest albums of all time.The profound left uprising of the 1970s is a large determinant of the ideology evident on Animals; the after effects of the Vietnam War, a stalemate between the opposing sides of the ideological spectrum, left the world in a disarray, seemingly disillusioned by the supposed sanctity of capitalism in contrast to the ‘Evil Empire’. Economic crises gripped Britain (along with other Western nations, but particularly Britain in respect to Pink Floyd), a pressure borne by the working class. It was these conditions and others like them that ultimately led to the deep seeded cynicism apparent on Animals. The album’s construction is purely metaphorical: ‘Dogs’, ‘Pigs’ and ‘Sheep’ represent the different tiers in the capitalist hierarchy, each song creating a representation of its respective character through ingenious lyrics and at times, musical expressions that are reflective of a particular character’s nature. Beginning with 'Dogs', Pink Floyd paints the portrait of a ruthless and self-obsessed bourgeoisie, the hounds of the upper class. In layman's terms, businessmen, utilizing the free market system to their own and their superiors' advantage; ultimately to the disadvantage of the lower classes, who are forced to bear the brunt of actions from the likes of H.E. Pennypacker, wealthy industrialist and philanthropist, an alias brought to life by Seinfeld's Cosmo Kramer. Such a personality is immortalized in the lines: You got to be able to pick out the easy meat with your eyes closedAnd then moving in silently, down wind and out of sightYou gotta strike when the moment is right without thinkingThe vehement scorn of Pennypacker and co. is brought to light after an atmospheric interlude, one which harkens back to the musical techniques more commonly associated with Pink Floyd’s past; the barking of dogs layered over a synthetic backdrop does well to set the mood and build up towards one of the greatest imaginable finales to a song. Cleverly using the metaphor of a dog, the song alludes to the action of tying a stone around a dog’s neck, subtly referring to the inevitable downfall that awaits the bourgeoisie.And when you lose control, you'll reap the har..."
954,"Original Question: What will happen now that President-elect Donald Trump has won the election?Nothing.America was always America.The people who voted for Trump always existed.

Some of you even pray to the same God and worship with them at church.They were angry. They didn't like the direction Obama was taking the country. He was beginning to turn the massive ship called America around.Poor people were able to access health care. Gay and lesbian people were beginning to gain rights. Immigrants, of all types, believed the American Dream was finally becoming a reality.Trump and his supporters didn't ever want anything to truly change.

955,"The spectrum is huge. Many autistic kids do not have the same symptoms as others. These are symptoms that I have noticed in younger children:Speech delay.Poor eye contact.Walks on tippy toes.Very intelligent. Usually siblings are gifted.Mimics what he or she hears.Frequently wanders.Stubborn!Can easily memorize lines of dialogue from a movie.Early reader. Poor comprehension but can read the words.Likes order or a routine.Cannot attend to a conversation. Will just walk away.Difficulty staying on task when the desired work is not highly-interesting to the child. The autistic child will walk away from school work when assignment is incomplete. The autistic child might often rush through work to get it done as fast as possible.Often stares at nothing in particular.Weak upper body. Poor hand strength.Becomes obsessed with something they enjoy like Thomas the Train.Fixates on a particular object and frequently carries it around. I knew of one child who carried a clothes hanger. Another child carried a toy sea creature.Has one or more parents that is very logical/ mathematical or scientific.Intelligent parents.Sometimes they have an older father.The best way to help an autistic child is to start therapy/ intervention as a toddler. Talk to your doctor and get help. Go to your school district. Many districts start therapies at a very young age. My school district has therapist that will come to your home, free preschool and other no-cost services.Do not wait. The earlier an autistic child gets help, the better the results."

957,"Death.Every single person on this planet dreams. Save for about 1% of the population that has suffered damage to the posterior parietal region due to brain damage of some kind. And on occasion they have been able to recover from it. However, the problem has been known to cause the person to go into a coma or become unconscious during sleep.Dreaming is your connection to the higher self, super-consciousness, your soul, your multidimensionality, and anything else that you would like to call that knowing subtle energy body that you have.When you sleep, you “RE PAIR” with all the facets of you and dreaming is a profound and necessary component of that. You are rejoining what has been fragmented, rejoining with a life source that you must have to survive. Without it, there is no life in the physical body, here."
958,"Yes, you can live comfortably in Arlington, VA on $80,000. Before my wife and I were married, we both earned well under that bottom number, and we both lived separately and comfortably in VA. She was in the Courthouse neighborhood of Arlington, and I lived in Alexandria.If you were to budget 25% of your salary (using the $80k mark) for housing, you’d be looking at $1600/month (or thereabouts) for rent. You should have little difficulty finding an apartment within walking distance of cool restaurants, bars, shops, and the subway for that price. You might even be able to rent a house for that. Then take on some roommates to defray that cost even further.Add in other utilities, and you can still be comfortably around 33% of your take home pay, leaving you some discretionary income left over for going out, and enjoying all the DC area has to offer.A little further out there is an area of Fairfax called the Mosaic District. Also close to the subway (Metro), it’s a recently developed “town center” concept. Lots of great little shops and restaurants, including a big new Target, and a movie theater.TL;DR; Yes, you can live quite well on $80–114K/year salary in the DC area."
959,"When you desire information that someone else has, it's often a good idea to simply ask the person for the information.This is ineffective if the person wishes to keep the information secret, but most people are comfortable talking openly about their relationship status.In which case, the only reason you wouldn't ask is your own desire for secrecy. You don't want the person to know that you're curious about their relationship status, probably because you don't want them to know that you're romantically interested in them. You'd feel embarrassed if you asked them out and they had a boyfriend.At that point, you can ask their friends, or you can try to subtly elicit the information without directly asking for it. If those options are not available to you, then you put on your grown-up undies and *ask*."
960,"As the weather gets cooler, curling up on the couch with a hot bowl of soup sounds so inviting.And it’s best to stay away from cream based soups, which may have a lot of added fat. Lentil soup, however, is delicious, nutritious and filling enough that it can be the star of your meal.Lentils are popular in Mediterranean and Indian cooking and come in a variety of types and colors, including red, green and brown. They are reportedly one of the oldest known sources of food, dating back to more than 9,000 years ago.They absorb flavor very well, so in addition to soups, lentils are great for stews and curries. You can even make a cold lentil salad for a gluten-free “pasta salad.” Just be mindful of prepackaged lentils, which may have gluten. I recommend that you visit the bulk section of the grocery store and buy natural lentils.Along with peas and beans, lentils are legumes.“Although research supports the benefits of legume consumption, only ∼8% of U.S. adults report eating legumes on any given day,” according to the National Institutes for Health (NIH).Just a serving of lentils a day may help prevent heart disease.According to a study, eating a serving of legumes (like lentils) may significantly reduce bad cholesterol in the body and, as a result, reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease. This is likely due to the high fiber content in lentils (about 15 grams in one cup).Lentils are cholesterol free and still pack a significant amount of protein (about 18 grams in one cup). Contrary to popular belief, cholesterol is not bad for you. Your body actually needs it to build cells. The problem occurs when you have too much cholesterol. Your body (particularly your liver) makes all the cholesterol you need. Many of us get excess cholesterol from animal foods, like meat and dairy.Lentils also contain antioxidants that may help prevent atherosclerosis, when plaque builds up in the arteries.Lentils have fiber.In general men need about 38 grams of fiber a day, and women need about 25 grams.Fiber may do a lot for your body, including:Aid digestion and relieve constipation. It may even help relieve symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS).Reduce risk of diabetes and help better manage diabetes. Fiber in the intestines may lower the absorption of sugar, which may help blood sugar levels from spiking.Reduce risk of cancer, particularly colon.Aid with weight management. Fiber makes you feel fuller longer, which may help with weight loss and maintaining a healthy weight.And one cup of cooked (boiled) lentils also contains essential vitamins and minerals including:Calcium, 38 mg. An adult between 19-50 years of age (male or female) in general should aim to have about 1,000 mg of calcium per day. This mineral is needed to build and maintain strong bones and teeth. Calcium is also needed for clotting of the blood to stop bleeding and for proper functioning of the nerves, muscles and heart. The National Cancer Institute conducted a study that monitored calcium intake in 135,000 men and women. The subjects who had a calcium intake of more than 700 mg per day had a 35-45% reduced risk of cancer of the distal (lower) part of the colon than those who had a calcium intake of 500 mg or less per day.Magnesium, 71 mg. This mineral helps regulate blood pressure, contributes to bone metabolism and has antioxidant functions. Magnesium is also great for pain management. Many people use magnesium as a safe alternative to ibuprofen or acetaminophen. Magnesium may even help alleviate leg cramps women may experience during pregnancy.Phosphorus, 356 mg. This mineral works with calcium to build strong bones and teeth. It is also needed to help balance and use other vitamins and minerals, including vitamin D, iodine, magnesium and zinc.Potassium, 731 mg. There’s a surprising connection with the liver and potassium. Liver injury or infection causes patients to urinate their potassium out. When the liver heals, the potassium levels start to go back up. This has implications for people with chronic liver problems, in terms of both diet as well as use of medications, since very low potassium levels can be more dangerous than the liver problem alone. Potassium may also help keep blood pressure under control and may even help reduce kidney stones and bone loss as you age.Folate, 358 mcg. Folate (also called vitamin B9) is a very important nutrient, especially for pregnant women. Folate may also help prevent cancer and heart disease and improve mental health. A study from Harvard Health demonstrated folate may also be useful in treating symptoms of depression.Remember, healthy eating is one of the best ways we can be proactive about our overall health. Make every meal an opportunity to do something good for your body.Source: Why Lentil Soup May Be Better than Chicken SoupI hope my answer was helpful!

961,"When I was in my 10 standard I made a model to show properties of similar triangles:-Property1-Corresponding angles are congruent (same measure)Property2-Corresponding sides are all in the same proportionSo, I made a single standing triangle on a wooden board with just 3 pieces of logs with the help of a carpenter nearby.2 sides were stick such that they form 2 adjacent sides of a triangle and the 3rd side was free to make different triangles from the same base model and show those above 2 properties.Then I put some nails on the logs such that each nail on one log have the corresponding nail on another log such that if I put the 3rd free log on the nails it forms the 3rd side. and I can lift it and put it on another pair of nails.Thus 1st property can be evidently seen. Also at the same time when I put the log on different pairs of nails, the different triangles thus formed will have the same proportions of sides as well.Here I attach some 3d images.This is particularly simple but if you play more with this you can make it more amazing like using threads to roll them over nails from different pairs and see if they form some amazing triangles.This is what it will look like-(Here the 3rd side is lying free)These black dots are nails.So in previous 3 images I used different pairs of nails to form the 3rd side of a triangleAll three triangles so formed are similar.They will certainly have all their corresponding angles equal and also they will have the same proportion of respective sides.Note:It is not a solid project. It just shows intuition that how math can be visualized.For more such content Please subscribe http://www.youtube.com/fivecube and Gugal OxideOther Projects that you can make include1)Showing how ellipse can be formed using 2 nails and thread and a pencil using your hand(or motor if you wish to make it really mechanical)…(but u haven’t studied it in 10?

962,"How to Gain Weight SafelyA large part of the population has to deal with being overweight or obese. But there are also many people with the opposite problem, as they are too thin or underweight. This is a concern because being underweight can be just as bad for your health as being overweight. It is also true that many people who are not officially underweight still would like to add a few pounds. Whether you have officially underweight or are a ""hard gainer"" who has difficulty in gaining weight, the main principles are the same. In this answer, I will show you how you can quickly gain weight in a healthy way.What is underweight?Underweight is defined as a body mass index (BMI) of below 18.5. This is seen as less than the body weight in order to maintain good health. On the other hand, above 25 is considered overweight and over 30 as obese. Use the BMI calculator to check your current BMI. However, remember that there are many problems with the BMI calculation, as it only takes into account your weight and height. It does not account for muscle mass. Some people are naturally very thin but healthy. Underweight according to the BMI calculation does not necessarily mean that you have a health problem. Underweight is more common among girls and women than among men.How can you gain weight healthily?If you want to gain weight healthily, it is very important that you do it right. Pigging out with sodas and donuts might help to gain weight, but it can also ruin your health. If you are underweight, then you want to achieve a balanced amount of muscle mass and subcutaneous fat, and not a lot of unhealthy belly fat. There are many people of normal weight who has type 2 diabetes, heart disease and other health problems associated with obesity. Therefore it is of utmost importance that you live a healthy diet and eat in a healthy way. Conclusion: It is very important to eat mostly healthy even if you are trying to gain weight. Now let's look at several effective ways to quickly gain weight without ruining your health.Eat more calories than your body burnsThe main thing you can do to get it is to eat more calories than your body needs. A calorie surplus is needed. Without it you do not gain weight. You can approach your calorie needs (maintenance level) by multiplying your body weight by 30. If you want to gain weight slowly and steadily, aim for 300-500 calories above your maintenance level food. If you want to quickly gain weight, you point it at approximately 700-1000 calories above your maintenance level. Remember that rules for calculating calorie needs only provide a cure. Your specific needs may differ by a few hundred calories, upwards or downwards. You do not count calories for the rest of your life, but it helps to count the calories in the first few days/weeks to get a sense of how many calories you should eat. Conclusion: You should eat more calories than your body burns in order to gain weight. Focus on 300-500 calories above your maintenance level, or 700-1000 calories if you need to arrive quickly.Eat plenty of proteinThe most important nutrient for anyone who wants to gain weight healthily is protein. Studies show that during periods of overfeeding, a high-protein diet converts a lot of extra calories into muscle. But remember that protein is very filling, so it can reduce your hunger and appetite. This can make it difficult to get enough calories.  Try to consume at least 1.5 - 2.2 grams of protein per kilogram of body weight. Foods with many proteins are red meat, chicken, fish, eggs, dairy products such as cottage cheese, and nuts. Protein supplements like whey protein may also be useful if you're struggling to get enough protein. Conclusion: Proteins are the building blocks of your muscles. Eating enough protein is required to arrive in muscle rather than just fat.Eat plenty of carbs and fat, and eat at least three ti..."
963,"This is the surface of a car? Up on the hood (bonnet), or the roof? If so, I highly doubt it was a snake, since the metal surface of a car would become way too hot on a sunny day for a snake. Snakes will bask in the sun when the temperature is cool; this is how they warm up. But on a warm, sunny afternoon they will seek cool places like damp leaves in the shade or a little space under a rock.A snake has smooth scales on its belly, not “toothed” structures that could make a pattern like that. Additionally, I can't think of any way a slithering snake could leave a lighter colored trail by slithering across a surface.It could be helpful to know the size of the marks. How wide is that little path? I wonder if your mystery pattern could be from the tail feathers of a bird, hopping around on the car. But that's just speculation."
964,There is a 50% offset clause in the Rafale deal.That implies 50% of the components used to manufacture the warbird will be sourced from India (now you know from whom in India). Also recall the recent shift in Indian defence policy towards indigenous procurement. So Reliance stands to gain from it.Moreover they will also gain the capability to manufacture equipment which is defence related. Unlike TATA & Mahindra who manufacture vehicles (it gives them a leverage with MOD ) Reliance is more of a lateral entry. So Dassault is like a kick start mechanism.A close look at LNT gives us a cue as to how the capacity to manufacture defence related equipment adds to your credibility (Which Reliance lacks)This is what I think….

966,"Meeting one’s soul mate is like meeting no other. Perhaps you will first notice the person because, at first sight, they will stand out in a crowd like a 100 watt light bulb would on a Christmas tree. Your first inner thought might ask, is this the one? When you meet the energy between you will be electric and the two of you will naturally get along. You’ll find that you hold almost all (if not all) of the same interests, desires and goals. Conversation between the two of you will flow effortlessly and neither of you will want it to end. Being with your soul mate will make you happy and content. You’ll find that it is easy to relax and be yourself in their presence. Intimate relations between the two of you will begin at the same high level as they do in all new relationships, but with your soul mate this sexual energy will not evaporate (as it has in past relationships), rather, in time it will reach an ever higher level (one you’re unlikely to have experienced before) and remain there forever. Your soul mate will probably know many of your thoughts before you express them as you will know his (this may at first seem a little spooky – in over 40 years this never ceased to amaze me as Jeane consistently knew what I was thinking in the same way I knew her thoughts).As you get to know your soul mate a deep connection will form between the two of you; you will be best friends, constant companions and electric lovers. Once you begin living together you will both discover that you will never tire of each other’s company. When you go out as a couple others will notice that there is “something special” about the two of you, even if they have a difficulty in saying exactly what this difference is. Year after of year of togetherness will not dim any aspect of your connection and one day you’ll realize that you’ve achieved the kind of perfect relationship together that is described in books, movies and fairy tales.In short; being with one’s soul mate is like going from driving a Mazda Miata to driving a Lamborghini: There is no comparison!"
967,"Steve jobs had a beautiful saying. It goes like this:""Everything around that you call life was made up by people who were no smarter than you.""People pleasing comes from approval addiction.It comes from the misguided belief that people like you because of what you did for them and not because of who you are. It becomes toxic when you start compromising your own values and beliefs in order to please somebody and get their approval. With time, you start losing sense of who you are. Your self disintegrates and then there is nothing of you that remains.There is a three step process that goes in every unhappy people pleaser :1. You sacrifice your own values and beliefs to please somebody and get their approval.2. You feel resentful.3. You start blaming other people.The way to break this cycle is to understand that you can live your life the way you want it without anybody's approval and there is nothing wrong about it. That once you decide to have a life then people who are similar to you will automatically feel attracted towards you, like you and respect you. You don't have to do anything for them that involves sacrifice. You just have to BE and they will like you for that.Once you get over your fear of disapproval and start approving yourself, slowly and slowly, you will feel less and less disturbed whenever somebody disapproves of you.It is a gradual process of self awareness and self love. You realise that the most important person you need to please is yourself. It doesn't mean you are being selfish. It just mean that you care about your own feelings and values more than that of  others. That you are willing to fight for yourself. That you will not sacrifice your values for somebody else. That You can still be a compassionate and caring person while firmly rooted in your own values and beliefs.Getting over approval addiction means getting over your fear of disapproval, conflict and condemnation. It means creating boundaries and not let anybody violate them in any circumstances.It means taking responsibility for your feelings and your life.It means choosing happiness over resentment.It means choosing self respect over self loathing.It means loving yourself even if at the moment, you believe nobody does."
968,"...and my long distance girlfriend asks me to answer this question. Michelle and I have had a long distance relationship for almost two years now. At the end of this month I'll be moving in with her, closing the three hundred mile gap that's been between us to zero. I can't wait.Here's how we did it, in no particular order:Be in each other's presence as often as possible. For us, that was an average of once a month for a weekend. That's rough, but better than nothing. I had many different coping mechanisms for this, and not all of them were healthy. A lot of self reflection and incredible patience from Michelle got me over the hump.Face time. If you can't be with each other, see each other. The webcam is a wonderful thing, use it. Google hangouts, Skype, whatever. Being able to share a smile, a goofy wink, blowing kisses, or just to stare in each other's eyes can not be understated.Phone time. If you can't be with each other or see each other, talk. As often as possible. Just hearing the other person's voice can do wonderful things to your psyche. Michelle and I would read Quora answers to each other.Patience. Your going to need a lot of this, and it's going to have to go both ways. I lack in patience. This had a tendency to make things more difficult than they needed to be. Don't be me.Understanding. Man, this long distance stuff is tough, isn't it? Always moping around, trying to ""find the time"" to get your stuff done and still spend some quality ""cam time"" together. All the stress, all the pressure. You do realize it's tough on your significant other too, right? Right? Sometimes, you just need to shut up and let your love vent their frustrations. Don't judge. Don't make it personal. Just listen and understand.Don't turn off your emotions. I did this. It was one of my coping mechanisms and it hurt Michelle and stunted my emotional well being. It sure seemed easier to shut down and not pine and mope and miss Michelle, but it's not. Don't do it.Communicate. Hey look, something else I struggled with. I had a thirteen year relationship with an alcoholic before Michelle, and quite honestly, I think I forgot how to communicate in a healthy relationship. Don't be me. Keep those lines of communication open and express yourself and your feelings.Love, unconditionally. Easy to say, harder to do. Relationships can be hard enough, long distance relationships even harder. Don't muck it up with a bunch of ifs ands or buts. Just love. That's why you're here in the first place.I can tell you without any hesitation that Michelle held this relationship together better than I did, and I'm thankful. I love her with all my heart and can't imagine where we'd be if she had let my stubbornness, my temper and many other flaws get in the way. I'm going to return the favor and A2A Michelle so you can see how to really make a long distance relationship work. Even with a putz like me.I love you, baby."
969,"I have already answered a similar question. Let me reproduce the answer here.Most of us (especially, Indians) form a sentence in our native language, translate it in English and then use it in a conversation. You have to stop doing that. Start thinking in English. Its a bit tough, but it will become easier and spontaneous with time. Don't think in your native language, think in English. This is the biggest hurdle in the process of improving your communication skills. Once you cross it, nothing can stop you.Now how to do that? Simple. Speak with your mind whenever you get time. But speak in English. Don't worry about grammar. Just speak.Now, let's focus on improving your fluency.Start reading newspapers, magazines, novels, blogs and whatever you can. But don’t just read, try to understand it. And make an opinion about it. Especially about editorials, opinions and issues.For example, lets say you read an article about drought in India. After reading it, think about it for some time. Then talk to yourself about it. Stand in front of a mirror and explain the issue to your reflection. Sounds funny, right? But trust me, it will help. And also think about what can be done to solve the problem, its outcomes etc and tell it to your reflection. Initially you will feel embarrassed, but keep doing it and you will certainly improve your English.One more activity that might help. I assume you have a laptop or pc (even a smartphone would work). Download some good serials (I will recommend Sherlock, Suits and GOT(caution: this one not for children)) and watch them by keeping subtitles on. Understand how they talk, how they pronounce a particular word. Then mute that serial and try to make similar pronunciations by reading those subtitles. It will not only improve your pronunciation but also boost your confidence.One more activity that might improve your fluency in English. Find a friend/relative/anyone (being an Indian, I know that this can be a bit tough as whenever you start speaking in english, you are accused of ""shininig"") who speaks English fluently and converse with him as much as possible. Ask him/her to point out your mistakes and also how to correct them.P.S. I have developed a course on Unacademy for those who want to improve their English, especially spoken English.Learn Spoken English Using Innovative Methods - UnacademyYou can have a look at it. It’s absolutely free."
970,"Now that the House Intelligence Committee has concluded that there was no Russian collusion between trump and Russia, can we start looking at other foreign intervention in our election process?What we’ve had going on since the 2016 election is distrubing. Let me place this in some context for the bicoastal liberals who voted for Hillary. We had a speech recently of Hillary actually saying that the rest of the voters (non California and non New York) are smarter than all the republicans in the center of the country! But they believed in Trump, not Hillary.(Video in link)[1] Wow! We also have the media trying to say Trump is a horrible President because he’s involved with a porn star? Remember their defense of Bill Clinton who was guilty of peccadilloes for having “private meetings” with an intern.[2] In the White House and it was just personal. Just sex. Nothing to do with running the country. Fast forward to Obama’s use of our government to spy on us, collude with Hillary (DOJ and FBI and NSA) and Russia to fabricate their collusion narrative. Obama did far far worse than Trump ever did by using government to attempt to undo an election! Obama corrupted our entire democracy, while Trump may have corrupted his marriage. If you don’t see that difference then I don’t understand your progressive thinking.We have voter ID cards being given to Chicagoans[3] and,voter fraud (and dead voters) in several states like Texas for example (por exemplo).[4]With the aggressive positions on no border wall and DACA, plus immigration being unchecked (Open Border policy) by progressives to resist ICE, to advise illegals of them being at risk of deportation, the non-citizen voter situation is reaching critical mass.SHOCKING: Susan Rice Ordered NSA to Stand Down in 2016: SUSAN RICE, A LONGTIME ACCOMPLICE OF BARACK OBAMA ORDERED THE NATIONAL SECURITY COUNCIL TO STAND DOWN ON THE ALLEGED RUSSIAN MEDDLING IN THE 2016 ELECTION. SHE THEN THREATENED THEM WITH STRICT CONSEQUENCES IF THEY CONTINUED.This tells us (those who are interested in the truth and details) more of an insight into how Trump was spied on, and where the blame falls. Certainly no one in the Obama administration operated in deference to what President Obama wanted. Now we see who the operatives were and where the plan, or plans, have their genesis.When or will the media get off their high-horse and cut the nonsense they’re spreading about the Russians. The hypocrisy is stunning—I know, we all know, the Russians are out to disrupt our politics. Got it! What I can not fathom is the dishonest reporting by the major producers of news are not playing straight with their audience. The news media, one could argue, are colluding, aiding and abetting the Ruski’s. We have been hearing there are Russians trying to alter our politics. No! The News outlets are doing what the Russians could never do, and they don’t even have to translate their propaganda into English. They are pumping out filthy lies on TVs in every airport on this planet.Australian diplomat whose tip prompted FBI’s Russia probe has tie to Clintons The Australian diplomat whose tip in 2016 prompted the Russia-Trump investigation previously arranged one of the largest foreign donations to Bill and Hillary Clinton’s charitable efforts, documents show.Former Australian Foreign Minister Alexander Downer’s role in securing $25 million in aid from his country to help the Clinton Foundation fight AIDS is chronicled in decade-old government memos archived on the Australian foreign ministry’s website.We know that Downer and former President Clinton jointly signed a MOU (Memorandum of Understanding) in February 2006 that spread out the grant money over four years for a project to provide screening and drug treatment to AIDS patients in Asia.http://thehill.com/opinion/judic... The fact is that the Russians did not have to collude to achieve their purpose of disruption and influence. Russian intelligence is not known to run “colluders” in carrying out secret operations and rarely expose their operations in gratuitous meetings. Collusion theories tying Donald Trump to a Russian conspiracy remain the case of the dog not barking.After more than a year of intensive investigation by both the special counsel and multiple congressional committees, there is no direct evidence of Trump colluding with Russians. After roughly 100 criminal counts against 19 defendants and five plea deals with cooperating witnesses, there is no direct evidence. After dozens of pages of “speaking indictments” by Robert Mueller describing Russian operatives trying to influence the election and false statements from former Trump aides, there is no direct evidence.So, (considering what we now know?) Obama had no scandals during his administration (that embarrassed him). Some readers may be thinking—“that’s right!” Some readers may be thinking—“whiskey tango foxtrot!” Which, if any (to be objective), of these would points refute that statement?https://www.cnn.com/2018/02/27/p... SUSAN RICE, A LONGTIME ACCOMPLICE OF BARACK OBAMA ORDERED THE NATIONAL SECURITY COUNCIL TO STAND DOWN ON THE ALLEGED RUSSIAN MEDDLING IN THE 2016 ELECTION. SHE THEN THREATENED THEM WITH STRICT CONSEQUENCES IF THEY CONTINUED.I would note that the list (not detailed) certainly doesn’t include the residual scandals occurring whilst the changing of the guard was in process (aka a fair, open and free election). We’re current on that so you, the reader, can think about those as you get a tour de force and journey back over his 8 scandal free years...enjoy. Please comment, not on the length, but on any errors. I might want to write a book about our recent great first African American President. If Obama’s terms were scandal free, Nixon (Richard Nixon committed far greater crimes than the watergate break-in) and Clinton (http://www.history.com/topics/us-presidents/bill-clinton) deserve a pass by historians as to their “short comings”.At least Bill Clinton was only screwing around with a few people, yes I said it, while Obama was screwing over an entire country (I said it again—sorry). Nixon used a few “plumbers” to break into a DNC office while Obama’s people, including several politicians, broke in to our election process, collaborated with the Russians, violated several people’s 4th Amendment rights, abusing the FISA court, laundering money, etc. A slight difference in crimes.http://investmentwatchblog.com/t...The Complete List of Barack Obama’s Events PUBLISHED SEPTEMBER 17, 2013 · UPDATED JANUARY 19, 2018• $6 trillion in new national debt under Obama…after he promised to decrease the deficit.• Obamacare — A massive and incredibly convoluted bill which exponentially increases the federal government’s control over our personal lives…which neither Obama nor a single Democrat even read before passing, and which will likely bankrupt the nation.• In both the 2008 and 2012 presidential elections, the Obama campaign purposely disabled the credit card verification system for its Web site donations, allowing anyone from any foreign country to donate with no limit and no proof of identity; in both elections it was demonstrated that people overseas and people with obviously false identities were able to donate to Obama campaign, in direct violation of several laws. To this day it is not known what percentage of Obama’s campaign funds are illegally obtained, since there is no documentation.• Billions of taxpayer dollars gambled on “green” companies like Solyndra, NextEra, Ener1, Solar Trust and many others — all of which went bankrupt.• An intentional refusal to enforce federal immigration laws.• Unemployment at or above 8% for almost his entire term in office (which was actually closer to 15% actual unemployment).• Operation Fast & Furious — a government-sponsored illegal gun-running scheme designed to purposely go awry so as to induce public outcry for gun control.• Spent 20 years listening to a racist anti-American pastor (Rev. Jeremiah Wright), whom Obama described as a mentor. On March 18, 2008, Obama gave a speech in which he said “I could no more disown Jeremiah Wright than I could disown my own grandmother” and “[Wright's church, Trinity United] embodies the black community in its entirety.” Now Obama tries to pretend that Jeremiah Wright doesn’t exist, and that his extremist anti-white philosophy didn’t influence Obama’s worldview.• Increased the percentage of Americans dependent on food stamps to unprecedented levels (now over 15% of the nation’s population).• Militarily intervened in Libya in 2011 without the Congressional approval required by the War Powers Act — technically an impeachable offense.• Before he entered politics, Obama worked as a lawyer suing banks in landmark cases, forcing them to give home loans to unqualified minority borrowers — a practice now understood as one of the primary initial causes of the eventual housing bubble and market collapse.• Handed out over 1,200 waivers to politically connected donors exempting them from the onerous requirements of Obamacare.• Greatly expanding the number of unaccountable “czars,” which essentially amounts to unilaterally adding new federal departments with no congressional oversight — leading to a true “bureaucracy” in the original sense (rule by unelected bureaucrats).• Using taxpayer dollars to bail out the private pension funds of autoworkers’ unions at GM & Chrysler.• Illegally ending the welfare-to-work requirements passed by Congress.• Doling out $800 billion in stimulus cash for “shovel-ready” jobs that didn’t exist — the money just evaporated with no measurable economic benefit.• Alienating and isolating Israel, our strongest ally in the Middle East.• Apologizing to Islamists and terrorists for offending them.• Under Obama’s watch, for the first time in history America’s credit rating was downgraded, due to his poor economic policies.• Stopped American oil drilling in the Gulf of Mexico, allowing other nations with worse environmental records to drill instead — thereby managing to both weaken our economy and damage the environment simultaneously.• Proposed in 2008 to intentionally bankrupt the coal industry — and now lies to voters and workers in coal-producing regions about his true intent.• Pretends to be concerned about skyrocketing energy prices, when in fact he vowed to increase them on purpose (so as to make alternative energy schemes more competitive.)• In a primary debate against Hillary Clinton in 2008, Obama said he would never force people to buy health insurance, since those without it couldn’t afford to buy it. Less than two years later, he rammed through Obamacare, which does indeed force people to buy health insurance.• During the 2008 campaign, Obama repeatedly promised that if he was elected “No family making less than $250,000 will see any form of tax increase.” This promise was broken over and over again once he was elected.• In 2008 Obama vowed if elected to increase security along the U.S.-Mexican border — and then in 2010 stopped construction of a “virtual fence” on the border and re-routed money earmarked for border security to other projects.• Cash for Clunkers, which doled out taxpayer money to anyone who wanted to replace their old cars, but which mostly only ended up subsidizing the puchase of foreign-made cars by people who could have afforded them on their own anyway; meanwhile, the traded-in cars were all destroyed, creating a shortage and thereby increasing the cost of used cars, hurting the pocketbooks of poor people.• Violated the U.S. Constitution by authorizing assassinations and drone strikes to kill American citizens abroad — without due process.• Was caught on a “hot mike” promising the President of Russia that he would cave in to their demands for a weaker missile shield — after he was re-elected and no longer had to keep up the pretense that he sought to defend America.• Appointed Van Jones, a former avowed communist who supported a “9/11 Truth” petition, to be “Green Jobs Czar.”• Appointed Anita Dunn, who said Chairman Mao was her “favorite philosopher,” to be White House Communications Director.• Appointed John Holdren, who perviously entertained the notion of forced mass sterilzation to stop overpopulation, to be Science Czar.• Appointed Steven Chu, who openly advocated an artificial increase in gasoline prices to $10/gallon (and similar increases in other energy prices) to be Secretary of Energy.• Appointed Kevin Jennings, who led a group that promoted X-rated “sex-positive” textbooks for 13-year-olds, instructed teenagers at a conference how to perform “fisting” (anal penetration by fists), who refused to report instances of statutory rape, and who expressed admiration for a member of NAMBLA, to be America’s “Safe School’s Czar.”• When states voted to enforce the federal immigration laws which the federal government refused to enforced, Obama sued to stop them.• Blocked continued construction of the Keystone Pipeline, thereby intentionally reducing energy resources for the US and forcing Canada to sell more of its oil to China.• Repeatedly changed his position on gay marriage over the years, depending on what was politically expedient at the moment and which intended audience he was addressing.• Before he was president, Obama staunchly opposed raising the national debt limit — but once elected, he insisted that it be raised.• When giving a 2009 speech in France that he must have assumed Americans would never hear, he described the United States as “arrogant” and “dismissive” (while also criticizing Europe elsewhere in the speech).• When states tried to stop election fraud with voter ID laws, Obama sued to prevent them from doing so.• Instructed Attorney General Eric Holder to stonewall any investigation into the voter intimidation case against the New Black Panthers.• Promised in 2008 that once elected he would officially recognize the Armenian Genocide; but to this date he has still failed to do so, caving in to threats and pressure from Turkey.• Vowed to end the influence of lobbyists in Washington, but under Obama’s watch their influence has only increased.• When he was first running for President, Obama promised, “I will not sign any non-emergency bill without giving the American public an opportunity to review and comment on the White House website for five days.” Needless to say, he has broken that promise with almost every bill he has signed since.• Aided and abetted the “Arab Spring” which deposed existing secular governments across North Africa, leading to a regional power vacuum which was filled by Al Qaeda, the Muslim Brotherhood, and other hardline Islamists.• Refused to provide assistance or support the the earlier secular Iranian democracy uprising, allowing them to be crushed by the Islamic fundamentalist Iranian regime.• In his first months in office, Obama bowed to the king of Saudi Arabia, the president of China, the Emperor of Japan, and President of Mexico, among others.• Ordered NASA to make one of its top priorities not space exploration or scientific research but “Muslim outreach.”• Used Obamacare as a pretext to greatly increase the size and power of the IRS (which was given 16,000 new agents and additional mandates to penalize taxpayers for noncompliance).• Used the IRS to harass conservative businesses.• In the GM bailout, he illegally shortchanged investors who according to bankruptcy laws were first in line to be recompensed; instead, he gave their share to the unions.• Shut down oil drilling in the US, but then turned around and lent $2 billion to Brazil to support their government-controlled oil-drilling effort — and then promised the US would become one of Brazil’s biggest oil customers.• Sued Boeing in an effort to control where businesses could locate, kowtow to the unions, and block the creation of 1,000 jobs in South Carolina, a right-to-work (i.e. no forced unionization) state.• Adopted a longstanding Socialist political slogan, “Forward!”, as his 2012 campaign motto.• Sent insulting form letters to the familes of dead SEALs.• Neither disavowed nor distanced himself from anti-Romney campaign ads which threatened or implied violence against Republicans.• Shortly after the recent eruption of anti-American violence in North Africa, Obama went to Las Vegas to do his debate preparation in a hotel…with a romanticized North Africa theme.• Said in an interview that the Muslim call to prayer was “one of the prettiest sounds on earth at sunset.”• Union boss and far-left activist Andy Stern has visitied Obama in the White House at least 53 times, at last count — greater access than any other private citizen.• Hosted at the White House many Islamist members of groups associated with Hamas, the Muslim Brotherhood, etc.• Sponsored performances by and attended fundraisers with radical rappers like Michael Franti and Common, both of whose lyrics have in some cases been anti-police, anti-white, and anti-America.• Hired Timothy Geithner, who is documented as cheating on his own personal taxes, to be Secretary of the Treasury.• Told Joe “the Plumber” Wurzelbacher that it was good to “spread the wealth around.”• Told small business owners nationwide in a 2012 speech that “you didn’t build that” — implying that they should not claim credit for their own success, since taxpayers (i.e. themselves and other business owners) had funded the national infrastructure.• Insulted the British people by rudely returning to them a bust of Churchill which previously had been a ceremonial gift on display at the White House; when later confronted on this inexplicable action, he lied about it.• Canceled plans to complete a missile defense shield in Poland, a move which was highly praised by Russia — the very nation whose missile threat would have been neutralized if the shield had been completed.• By loudly publicizing (for personal political gain) the identity of exact SEAL teams who had killed Osama bin Laden, Obama made them a target for reprisals by Islamists; a short time later 22 SEALS were shot down and killed in Afghanistan, their worst loss of life ever.• Established an extra-Constitutional top secret “kill list” of people (including Americans) Obama claims the right to kill on sight, and then bragged about it publicly.• Set up a special email account, “Flag@Whitehouse.gov,” to which Americans were supposed to inform the government of anyone they heard spreading “disinformation” about Obama’s health care overhaul. (This was the first of three different “spy on your friends and neighbors” programs.)• “Attack Watch” was Obama’s second Big Brother attempt, a Web site on which you would report “attacks” on Obama’s proposals and ideology; it was quickly shut down due to outrage and mockery.• Finally, Obama set up the “Truth Team” program which encouraged citizens to report to the government any friends or relatives they hear repeating “lies” about Obama. The Truth Team site still exists.• Twisted the arms of defense contractors to not issue layoff notices in early November, so as to avoid causing bad news for Obama right before the election — even though federal law (the “WARN Act”) requires such notices.• After the attacks on American interests in North Africa on September 11, 2012, Obama gave a speech to the U.N. and declared “The future must not belong to those who slander The Prophet of Islam” — transferring the blame from the attackers onto the makers of a film trailer that supposedly “offended” the Islamists.• Repeatedly snubbed and got into public tiffs with Benjamin Netanyahu, who as the leader of Israel is supposed to be Obama’s closest colleague in international affairs.• On May 19, 2011, Obama told Israel they must return to the 1967 borders as a pre-condition for continuing talks with the Palestinians — even though the status of the borders was the main issue the talks were supposed to address.• Encouraged politically biased hiring practices in the Justice Department.• Soon after taking office, Obama rescinded the “Mexico City Policy,” which previously had banned NGOs which are supported by American taxpayer funds from using those funds to perform abortions in foreign countries.• Attempted to force returning veterans to pay huge increases for their health coverage…as a way to generate more funding for his Obamacare provisions.• In June of 2011, he anointed his own underage daughters as “senior staff members” so that their vacation to Africa would be paid for with taxpayer money.• Interviews with high school classmates revealed that Obama was a heavy and frequent user of marijuana in his teenage years (not to mention his self-admitted cocaine use in college).• Played over 100 rounds of golf during his first three years in office, meaning that he was on the links close to 10% of the days he has been president.• Voted to allow post-birth abortions (i.e. facilitating the deaths of babies who survive late-term abortions) not just once but three times in a row as an Illinois state senator.• The pastor whom Obama selected to give the national benediction at his 2009 inauguration recently declared that “all white people are going to Hxxx.”• Sided with Hugo Chavez and the Castro regime regarding the Honduran Constitutional Crisis of 2009, the first time ever that the U.S. formed a political alliance with socialist governments in Latin America.• Obama Administration OKed the nomination of Chas Freeman to chair the National Intelligence Council (which coordinates intelligence reports from all government agencies), despite the fact that he was openly hostile to Israel and strongly favored Arabist goals. (He later withdrew under pressure.)• Chinese pianist Lang Lang played an offensively anti-American song at a 2011 White House dinner where Obama hosted Chinese president Hu Jintao, to the delight and amazement of the communist Chinese visitors, while Obama just sat there and smiled (the song’s Chinese lyrics describe Americans as “warmongering jackals”).• There was a great deal of (still unverified) suspicion that the company LightSquared received favorable treatment from the Obama administration for approval of its broadband technology which interfered with the GPS system; an Air Force general claimed he was pressured by the Obama administration to downplay his criticism of LightSquared’s technology in sworn testimony.• Obama’s Department of Energy awarded $529 million to Fisker Automotive to build their Karma hybrid electric cars — even though they are manufactured in Finland, cost over $100,000 each, and tend to explode.• When Inspector General Gerald Walpin discovered during a 2009 investigation that one of Obama’s political allies (the mayor of Sacramento) was misusing government funds for personal gain, Obama unceremoniously fired Walpin — even though rooting out fraud was the job description of the Inspector General.• More than once Obama made so-called “recess appointments” when the Senate was not actually in recess, which directly violates Constitutional rules about how appointments must be made; in each case it was his way of getting his political allies into certain key positions without them being vetted or approved by the Senate, as required.• After Nidal Malik Hasan massacred 13 people at Fort Hood while shouting “Allahu Akbar” so as to become a martyr for Islam, the Obama administration refused to classify his action as “terrorism” and instead deemed it merely “workplace violence.”• Despite the fact that the Falkland Islands have been part of Great Britain since 1833 and that Great Britain is supposed to be our strongest ally, Obama essentially sided with Argentina in its new claim on the Falklands, not only by adopting the Argentine position that their status is open to negotiation, but even by (attempting to) refer to the islands by their Spanish name (Malvinas).• Convened the National Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform (a.k.a. the Simpson-Bowles commission) in order to address a major economic crisis…and then summarily dismissed and ignored their recommendations.• Criticized the Supreme Court’s legal reasoning (about the Citizen’s United decision) during a State of the Union address, which many considered a dangerous precedent as it appeared to place political pressure on the court, violating the Constitution’s separation of powers; but his bullying seems to have later paid off, when the Supreme Court apparently altered its Obamacare decision so as to not ruffle any political feathers.• On April 27, 2009, Obama’s staff (possibly at his direction) ordered Air Force One to make an unnecessary very low flight over part of Manhattan and the Statue of Liberty, which many residents mistakenly assumed must be a second 9/11 attack in progress; turned out that it was just a stunt to get a photo op of Obama’s plane next to the Statue of Liberty.• Obama somehow managed to insert mentions of himself into the official biographies of earlier presidents on the White House Web site — even presidents from the 19th century. After public outcry, the narcissistic Obama mentions were quietly removed without comment.• Intentionally misquotes the Declaration of Independence in speeches, often leaving out the words “by their Creator” in the famous passage “…are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights,” which Obama instead has recited as “…are endowed with certain unalienable rights.”• In June of 2009, Obama’s Solicitor General (and now Supreme Court Justice) Elena Kagan filed a legal brief to prevent the families of 9/11 victims from appealing their lawsuits against the Saudi royal family for financing the 9/11 attacks.• The 2009 National Christmas Tree in the White House was decorated with ornaments depicting Chairman Mao, a drag queen, and a picture of Mount Rushmore that included Obama’s own head next to George Washington’s.• Compelled Catholic and other religious organizations to provide health plans with free contraception, even though such requirements violate their rights of religious freedom and conscience.• It was revealed only after Obama became president that during the 1990s he was a leading member of the “New Party,” a socialist-aligned far-left radical group in Chicago.• Lied about his close associations with former Weather Underground terrorist Bill Ayers; pretended the two barely knew each other, when multiple sources document they were friends and close colleagues for years.• When Obama was inaugurated as President on January 20, 2009, he at first flubbed the oath of office, so he had to re-take it behind closed doors for his inauguration to be valid. He did so, but during this second, true inauguration in private, he purposely failed to place his hand on a Bible, as is traditional — the first president ever to not swear the oath of office on the Bible.• Obama’s own author bio in his literary agent’s catalog and on their Web site stated for 17 consecutive years that he was born in Kenya; this claim remained intact despite other portions of the bio being altered and updated repeatedly. It was only in 2007 after he decided to run for the presidency that the “born in Kenya” claim was taken down. The original info must necessarily have come from Obama himself; some theorize he likely falsely claimed foreign birth in order to gain admission or scholarships in college, and never bothered to fix his lie.• After winning the 2008 election but before being sworn in, Obama bombastically concocted the official-seeming “Office of the President-Elect” as if it was some kind of real government department; in fact, it was just a self-congratulatory title he made up to look important before he actually became president.• Obama administration came up with the bizarre euphemism “man-caused disasters” to describe acts of terrorism — because he wants to downplay terrorism as a significant political issue.• For three years in a row his official budget proposals to Congress received exactly zero votes — not even a single vote from Democrats.• Relied on an Islamic fundamentalist militia group called “The Martyrs of the February the 17th Revolution Brigade” to provide security at the American mission in Benghazi — and they not only failed to prevent the attack but perhaps even joined in on it.• During the debate over Obamacare in 2009, Obama bluntly stated that doctors like to perform amputations rather than practice preventive medicine for no other reason than that they make a greater profit from amputations. The American College of Surgeons demanded an apology, which never arrived.• Since 2008 the Los Angeles Times has been in possession of a videotape showing Obama honoring and praising anti-Western anti-Israel academic Edward Said, but they have steadfastly refused to release it to this day, for no discernible reason other than their belief it would damage Obama’s reputation.• When the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe recently held a conference on human rights, Obama sent an American representative — Salam al-Marayati, a Truther who blamed Israel for the 9/11 attacks and who also praises Hezbollah and Hamas. To the nations of Europe, al-Marayati spoke for all Americans on the topic of human rights.• Obama’s Department of Homeland Security specifically warned that Americans who are “dedicated to a single issue, such as opposition to abortion or immigration” are potential terrorists, as are libertarian-minded voters who “favor of state or local authority” over centralized power. These “rightwing extremists” (who hold political beliefs shared by a majority of Americans) are deemed a greater threat to the nation than actual revolutionaries or jihadists.• While campaigning in 2008 Obama declared that it was “unpatriotic” that Bush had increased the national debt at a rate of half a trillion dollars per year; but under Obama the rate of national debt increase has accelerated to almost three times the Bush rate ($6 trillion in new debt in under four years) — yet Obama has never apologized nor declared himself unpatriotic.• For decades, every president has attended a “daily intelligence briefing” which updates him on critical world events each morning. Obama has skipped 60% of his daily intelligence briefings, including the ones leading up to the attack in Benghazi.Footnotes[1] Hillary: Trump's 'Looking Backwards' Reality TV Style Worked in Less Sophisticated, Less Diverse Red States | Breitbart[2] http://‘What About Bill?’ Sexual...[3] Chicago ID card would be valid voter identification[4] Voter Fraud Case Reveals Deceased Texans Still Voting - Empower Texans"
971,"Net Neutrality is a new name for a very old regulatory regime (Economic Policy) designed to prevent monopolists and oligopolists from extracting Economic Rents (and thus Economic Profit) from the markets that they control.The historical name is Common Carrier. It dates to the early days of Railroads. When there’s one rail line and one railroad company serving your town, they’ve got control of the bulk transport service for your town, and they can bleed you economically.Imagine that railroad company decides that they’re going to charge you by the value of what you want to transport rather than simply its weight or bulk (i.e. Price by Value): transporting ten pounds (or kilos) of Diamonds is going to be much more expensive than transporting ten pounds (or kilos) of Lead (element), despite that the cost of doing so to the railroad company is the same.Common Carrier regulation prohibits that practice on the part of transportation carriers. Trucking companies are common carriers. So is the U.S. Postal Service.It’s not much of a stretch to see how this type of regulation also applies to telecommunications services just as much as to transportation of physical goods. Imagine that the telephone company charges you a percentage of the price of a pizza delivery order you make by calling a pizza parlor, rather than just the cost of connecting your voice to theirs. If you have little or no choice in your telephone service provider (so you can choose another one that doesn't zap you by the value of your calls), you’re stuck being bled by the telephone company. Probably the pizza parlor is being directly bled, too (and probably suffering a reduction in orders because the pizzas apparently cost more to the customers, even though the pizza parlor didn’t raise its prices).This model also applies to The Internet.In the USA, Internet Service Provider (ISP) provision of Internet service to most businesses and residences is now mostly owned by two classes of companies: the old telephone companies (e.g. AT&T, Verizon) and cable TV companies (e.g. Comcast, Time Warner Cable). Both of those industries have been disrupted by the digital (computer) revolution in that both telephone service and television can be converted to digital data (bits) and transported by digital data networks. Both types of companies have converted their networks from application-specific (only voice telephone, or only TV) to general purpose digital data networks.However, if everything is just bits (digital data), then a data network that can move (transport, deliver) bits can deliver everything. In that world, a cable network is the same as a telephone network: both can deliver telephone service, and television programming (and anything/everything else that’s digital (piles of bits)). Oops, now they’re competing with each other!Being a purveyor (business) selling a commodity product or service (they’re all the same) is terrible because when the Business Competition is intense enough, the Profit Margins are very thin. This is why Product Differentiation is so very important in those markets - why/how is your product or service better than everyone else’s? However, when all you’re doing is moving bits around, all you can differentiate on (aside from price) is how fast, how little latency, and network availability (e.g., cellular wireless network coverage).But just imagine if you could peek at the bits the customer is moving over your network and charge them more for more valuable bits?It would be like Fedex looking into the letter envelopes it delivers and charging a percentage of the value of stock certificates or written checks or the value of a business contract letter as opposed to the holiday card your mom sends you. There’s all this high-value stuff that they’re moving around - why can’t FedEx (or UPS or DHL or the USPS) take a piece of that value for moving it, instead of just charging cost plus for the weight and/or size and/or delivery speed of the letter?Because Common Carrier law says you can’t … if you’re subject to it.Guess why the Internet Service Providers want out from under that regulation?This is why Net Neutrality is very important to all customers of all ISPs (which is to say, in the modern age, everyone). The concept behind “neutrality” is to treat all data across all data networks the same, where “treat” in this case means “price.” No differential pricing for movies, or voice calls, or E-mail, or just bulk moving of data - all of them moved over the network at the same price for a given level of service (so many bits per second across the data network link).We need to put and keep the ISPs under the thumb of common carrier regulations, and force them to compete with each other on a commodity price basis for our business.We also need to undo as much of the laws that present Barriers to Entry to new competitors, e.g., if the ISPs won’t serve a given municipality adequately, why can’t the municipality dig up their own streets, lay down optical fiber, and operate their own network, while approaching the cross-country ISPs for interconnection to the rest of the Internet (negotiating one flat price for the whole town)? That’s illegal in many states because the ISPs went to state legislatures to get laws passed to make it illegal to compete with them.We need more competition between ISPs (and more of them), and we want to keep our flat-rate pricing for Internet service.If “net neutrality” (i.e., Common Carrier status & regulation) for ISPs goes away, expect them to gouge us all. In answer to those who believe “well, they would never do that” see the latter half of Here's everything you need to know about net neutrality and the FCC's plan to end it.See also You Don't Want ISPs to Innovate from Wired (magazine) in 2010. This argument is not new, and the old Common Carrier legal remedies against ISP monopolist/oligopolist behavior are not “out of date” or “archaic” - they’re entirely relevant and appropriate today as when that law was first written in the Communications Act of 1934."

To give them a usable idea of your experience, you should be able to describe a particular situation, the task you were given, what actions you took, and the results of your actions.Prepare yourself to be able to describe several examples like this, within the context of your experience and the job you’re seeking at LM.2) Many of the facts in your resume and interview will be checked, such as college, degree, previous workplace, etc. If anything is found to be false or exaggerated you won’t be hired, or you’ll be fired after the fact if you are hired.3) It’s a standard recommendation to dress one level above the job you’re interviewing for. For professional/technical positions you should wear sport clothes, or suit, and tie for men and the equivalent for women."
976,"The main exports of Venezuela are two thing: Crude oil & Electricity.Although not as famous as Saudi Arabia, Venezuela is acutally has the biggest crude oil reserve around the world, 296 billion barral, while Saudi 265 billion, ranking No.2, and Iran 132.5 billion ranking 3. The reason why Saudi is so famous is that he is the biggest exporter of Crude oil around the world, and both Venezuela and Iran are unders economic sanctions. But among all the exports of Venezuela, crude oil still plays an critical role. In the year of 2015, crude oil export, with 27.8 billion USD, took 96% of the whole export amount of Venezuela.The second biggest export of Venezuela is electricity. In Venezuela, hydrau power station is the main way of electricity generating. But as this country owns abundant hydraulic resource, in the year 2010, he produced 116.7 billion KWH electricity, ranking 29 around the world. As comparation, Malaysia generated 116.7 billion,and Holland 114.8 billion. His nabour, Columbia, generated only 56.9 billions,and Peru only 34.8 billion.Regarding import, actually, this country imports everything."

982,"I absoilutely fucking loved it.The only thing that pissed me off was that the reveal of the title. Really. I mean. REALLY.Endgame was literally everyone’s first guess! and Kevin Feige and Marvel and the Russo Bros say it isn’t. They literally lied.What a bunch of a holes.This is what people think was what they’re telling us.I mean. I can see how the two Es, and the A, and the N fits. But how the hell did we know there was suppose to be a FUCKING G or M? They’re crazy I tell you.Right. What’s my review.Me. I personally LOVED it more than the Captain Marvel trailers.Its not just that Brie Larson didn’t show “emotions.” Its just it kind of revealed too much.The second trailer basically confirmed how Carol Danvers got her power. Hit a Kree Ship, landed on the ground, some people use Kree blood to turn her into a Kree Hybrid.The old lady is definitely a Skrull now.Basically, a lot of people didn’t like the trailers because they revealed too much. I was like eh. whatever. Its just trailers. Its not a movie guys. Lets watch the movie first.Then Avengers 4 trailer hit, and I was blown away.It almost revealed nothing, which was great. It didn’t show Captain Marvel, it didn’t show Rocket Racoon, it didn’t even show M’Baku or Happy Hogan.The funny thing is. Avengers 4 trailer kind of reminds me of Logan trailer.It starts off with Tony Stark giving out a video call to Pepper before he thinks he is going to die.What I like is that Iron Man’s final armor isn’t like a deus ex machina. It’s not overpowered. It makes sense that he lost most of his nanobots. Most ofh is nanobots are damaged. So it doesn’t make Iron Man ridiculously overpowered.What I also didn’t expect was that I know Tony Stark’s going back to Earth. I just forgot to worry how was Tony Stark going to experience going back to Earth. Remember, this isn’t the Q ship. This is the Guardians ship. Its slower than the Q ship. Tony and Nebula are trillions of miles away.And what struck me is that Tony Stark looks really skinny here. Its shocking, but it made sense. He hasn’t ate food or drank anything in days. And he just looks like he wants to die.I feel like Tony Stark is MCU’s best character, because he’s so complex. It also seems that he’s riding peter Quill’s old spaceship, the Milano. And one of his best quotes was “Part of the Journey is the End.” That’s pretty true. Also, his speech to Pepper was great. It was sad.Right after that, we get to hear some epic music that gives all of us goosebumps.We then get this shot of Thanos armor as a skeleton. Signifying that the Mad Titan is not done.Then we see Thanos hand. It seems that it was completely damaged. I guess Thanos can’t get his hand off the Infinity Gauntlet.Didn’t know the Avengers Headquarters is near a lake.The weird thing isThis is actually the first time we seen Steve Rogers cry.Now, its not a bad weird. Don’t get me wrong. Its weird in a good way. It was just something that I wasn’t expecting. It showed more emotion. Guess this is why people prefer Captain America more than Captain Marvel. *shots fired.*Shuri has apparently died from the snap. Or is missing.Which makes me wonder. How? why is she missing? Last time, Kevin Feige and Russo said that she survived the Snap. In fact, I think the actress said that.Which means that you shouldn’t believe anything the Russo bros and Kevin Feige says is true. So for people who say that Thor is stronger than Captain Marvel, or that Shuri is smarter than Tony Stark. If there are other people who argue that Shuri is smarter, just show that Kevin Feige and the Russo bros clearly lied before, so they could lie again. This is solid proof.It’s also pretty sad to see Peter Parker’s face show up. Spider Man is so popular, that he makes a cameo in this movie. Hopefully Spider Man shows up in this movie, and has a lot of screen time. Spider Man is my favorite super hero of all time!Oh and ..."

987,"First of all, you need to understand that EMI is not provided by flipkart or any other ecommerce player. It is the service of bank but interest rate can vary as according to merchant(in this case it is flipkart.)So, if you understand this now it should be clear that why there is no EMI service given on debit card. (as bank doesnt provide the facility)Now some Basics,Credit Card vs Debit CardCredit cardWhen credit card is assigned to you then bank takes a ""risk"" of not getting back the amount you spend on your card. As the amount you have spend on your card is yet to be paid, bank doesnt know that whether you will pay back the amount. Your credit card limit is LOAN you get from your bank. Debit cardNo risk in involved as the amount you spend is already present in your account and bank is assured of getting that money.Thats why we have verification for credit cards when you apply one but only saving account with minimum balance is needed in case of debit card.Now, apply this concept to EMI. As when you purchase something from credit card and if thats within your sanctioned limit, then bank agrees to give that LOAN to you and allows you to pay in EMI after charging interest.But when you prurchase from debit card, and if bank gives you the EMI then there is no guarantee that you will pay EMI as bank is not ready to take risk on you.EDIT:ICICI bank now provies EMI on debits cards but only when you have linked fixed deposits with your saving account. So, now bank is now taking risk on your fixed deposits and giving you the EMI's. Basics again remains the same"
988,"The question sounds like it’s posed to figure out how to map traditional, waterfall project management concepts into a Scrum/Agile framework. The problem is, that’s not really how it works. Scrum and Agile project management are fundamentally different from traditional project management in that the process is specifically designed to be loosely-coupled to the objectives being pursued. The whole point of an Agile approach is that you’re not measuring your progress against some abstract project plan or Gantt chart, but instead based on delivering working software every sprint and through rapid iteration on the underlying work.If you had to map these concepts to Scrum, you could say that each iteration is its own “milestone”, in that you stop, review, and adjust/correct if necessary after every iteration. Similarly, your “deliverable” is the product backlog — but not in the sense of traditional project management where there’s a strict contract for delivery; rather, in the sense that the backlog represents everything that could be done, and is prioritized in a way that focuses the teams on doing the most important work first, followed by the next most important, etc. until we decide to ship what we’ve got working.Tasks are something entirely different — and in fact many Scrum teams don’t even track tasks. They take in user stories (requirements) every sprint, and as long as they deliver what they say they will at the end of the sprint, we as a business shouldn’t care how they did it. Tasks in traditional project management are what would be considered “waste” in lean manufacturing and Agile perspectives — they’re usually administrative records that someone wants to keep for some reason completely apart from building working product. Unless the team finds value in tracking work at a task level, it’s probably not important enough to insist on."
989,"THINGS YOU CAN DO WITH ABSOLUTELY NOTHINGBlink wildly and then close your eyes really tight for an interesting light show(Amusement Potential: 1-5 minutes)See a variety of blobs, stars and flashes. Try to make out shapes and see if your subconscious is trying to send you a message (perhaps that funny shape is saying, 'send all your money to urban75.com'?)See how long you can hold a note(Amusement Potential: 4-20 minutes)Not that much fun, but it sure passes the time. Play with a friend, or try to beat your own personal best. Inhale deeply and then try and make a noise for as long as you can. Earn extra points for making your partner laugh or ending on an amusing note.Try to not think about penguins(Amusement Potential: 1-5 minutes)This is especially hard, because by trying too much, you remember what you were trying to avoid thinking of. If you try too little, you end up thinking about penguins anyway.Use your secret mind power(Amusement Potential: 5-10 minutes)Pick a passing by and try to use your mind power to command them do something, like drop their bag or knock into someone. The law of averages dictates that sooner or later one of your mind commands will come true, so you can convince yourself that you really have super human powers and waste even more time trying them out.Pretend you're a robot(Amusement Potential: 1-3 minutes)Walk down the street with mechanical movements, adding 'zzzzzt' sounds with each motion. Pretending to have a motor broken in, say, your left hand can add at least 30 seconds more entertainment.Scratch yourself(Amusement Potential: 1-3 minutes)Go ahead, scratch yourself now. Even if nothing itches, go ahead. Doesn't that feel pretty good?Rate passers by(Amusement Potential: 10-15 minutes)Secretly award passers by marks out of ten as you go along, offering (unsaid) expert criticism over their clothing, hairstyle and footwear choices.Repeat the same word over and over until it loses its meaning(Amusement Potential: 1-3 minutes)Pick a random word out of a magazine and say it aloud to yourself until it becomes a meaningless set of noises.Pinch yourself(Amusement Potential: 1-3 minutes)What is pain? Why is it unpleasant? There's nothing physical about it - it's all in your mind. Plus, after pinching yourself for awhile, boredom will seem nice next to being in pain.Try to swallow your tongue(Amusement Potential: 1-2 minutes)There's not much to say about this one. It is possible, but really stupid.Pretend to be a car(Amusement Potential: 5-10 minutes)Make appropriate revving noises in your head as you walk along and add a racing commentary as you pass strangers in the street. Use blinking eyes as indicators for extra authenticity.Make Star Trek door noises(Amusement Potential: 1-2 minutes)Stand by an electric door to a bank or something and make that silly ""Scccccccchwop"" sound heard whenever people popped on to the bridge to hang with Captain Kirk.Look at something for awhile, shut eyes, study after image(Amusement Potential: 2-5 minutes)Another great time waster. It takes about 30 seconds of staring to create an after image, and the image is then viewable for about the same length of time. Fun to combine this one with pushing on your eyes.Get yourself as nauseated as possible(Amusement Potential: 5-10 minutes)Best achieved by looking straight up and spinning around. Try to be so dizzy you can't even stand up. This is also entertaining due to the ""makes boredom seem a lot better"" effect (see ""Hurt Yourself"").Invent a weird twitch(Amusement Potential: 5-10 minutes)Adopt a bizarre twitch (e.g. flicking your head irregularly, twitching with eye or busting out sporadic cough noises) and try it out when you go shopping.Make a low buzzing noise(Amusement Potential: 15-30 minutes)Hours of fun in libraries! Keeping a totally straight face and looking nonchalant, make a low pitch humming/buzzing noise and see who reacts."

991,"My daughter went through this, too. She wore size 0 jeans but had D cup breasts. She was made fun of by others girls who accused her of “stuffing.” She finally got fed up in the locker room one day while changing and showed the girls her breasts to prove she didn’t stuff. They reported her for exposing herself (even though they were in the girls’ locker room changing for PE…)SHE is the one who got in trouble. Kids will make fun of other kids because of their own insecurities, to get the focus off of themselves and their own shortcomings. They will also make fun of others because they think it makes themselves look “cool” or “tough” and gets the attention of other students. Whatever the reason, no matter how harmless it seems to adults, it is still a form of bullying and should be brought to the attention of the school. As adults, we can think of things to say and more creative ways to handle these situations, but kids can be devastated by this kind of bullying. Bullying in any form can have serious effects on the person who is being bullied. There have been kids who have dropped out of school because of the incessant bullying at school. Others have gone as far as to commit suicide because of being bullied and harassed by their peers. As trivial as it may seem, I would address it with the school before it esculates into a worse problem. If the school does not help, go to the board of education and demand that something be done. This will not only reinforce to your daughter that you care enough to get involved, but it was also help bring attention to the bullying issue and send a message that bullying in ANY form is NOT okay and will NOT be tolerated. How you handle it all depends on how seriously you take the issue and how far you are willing to go to stop it. Some people will bauk and say my suggestions are stupid, overkill, etc. They may be right. But in my opinion, if it is serious enough that your daughter doesn’t want to go to school because of being bullied, then it is serious enough that it is interfering with her life and her daily activities and should be addressed."

994,"Yes I agree that the tariffs would increase by as high as 6-7%. Excessive bidding by the telcos have benefited the government but ultimately the cost would pass on to the consumers. To avoid the increase in tariffs, the government can use reverse bidding concept. In such a case, the government may fix a price for the spectrum, and may call for bids from the telcos on the basis of lower and lower tariffs that they would be charging after allocation of spectrum. In such a case, the telcos would try to keep the tariffs as low as possible. In the current scenario, although TRAI is controlling the prices of telecom service, but due to high spectrum prices and a high cost of capital thereon, the prices are bound to increase."

A good trader pics a share after 30 mins of market opening and always trades with stop loss and never takes delivery if his trade runs into losses (Always use stop loss). For intraday trading a share has to be highly volatile which means heavy buying or selling. Lastly a trader should also have some technical knowledge to read the direction of shares like candlestick analysis, moving average etc ...Most importantly one has to be emotionally detach with any trade he take as share market doesn't work on emotions. if you are new in intraday trading and you pick any share without basic technical analysis then be ready to take losses."
997,"Don't avoid arguments. Differences are good, but make sure you have a healthy relationship. A healthy relationship's foundation lies in trust, good communication & respect. How do you build a foundation like this? Let's start with the individual. The individualKnow who you are and what you want in life (identity). This creates a stronger you. A stronger you will be less affected by other people's moods and you will be more likely to be able to make a decision that builds on your personal growth. Knowing who you are and where you want to go, makes a more stable (consistent) you. A consistent you creates the building block for trust. People get to know you, because you behave in a consistent manner.  Your moody girlfriendThere are various reasons why your girlfriend can be moody (I haven't heard of a 24/7 menstrual cycle and men also get moody from hormonal fluctuations), so don't assume it is hormonal. If you think it is hormonal, calibrate her behaviour with other people. Has she also responded ""moody and mad"" with other people? If no, then maybe the problem she has, is with you. Either way, you two need to communicate better. Good CommunicationMen in general don't like this stage, because it requires them to properly communicate their feelings and thoughts; a skill that they haven't developed since childhood like women and therefore leaves them vulnerable. Good communication is about talking and listening (usually it is more about listening).  If you know who you are and where you going, you will have an idea of what you expect in your relationship. Can you share this with her? Does she ""listen"" (respect) to what you have to say? Can she share the same with you? There should always be a channel available between two people in a relationship (just like a parent will always be there for his/her child when he has done something wrong). A relationship is a partnership and without an open communication channel, you open yourself up to a world of miscommunication, misperceptions, jealousy, anger, fear and disrespectful behaviour. Before you know it, a little thing like a raised eyebrow, resulted in you breaking up. Bad communication affects trust. RespectValuing your partner for his or her opinions and differences, allows for the opportunity for good communication and builds on your trust levels. Respect affects all interpersonal relationships in life; even broader life (spiritual & nature). Not only do you have to respect others, you have to respect yourself. Never do or say things that disrespects your ""self"". It affects your identity, which in turns (once again) affects trust. So don't continuously tolerate her ""moody and mad"" behaviour. Know when to call it out. Emotional MaturityUnfortunately, we are not born with these abilities. We have to practise them. In our younger years we are more affected by our emotional states (due to hormones and brain growth), but this should never be accepted as a justification or excuse. Learning proper introspection and good communication skills can happen regardless of biological fluctuations. We emotionally mature through trying, failing and making better choices. So practise your three skills on your girlfriend. It will make you a better man for her and if not, for your next girlfriend. Sometimes the other person isn't in the same ""place"" as you are in life. That is ok. We all have our own journeys. Have the guts to move on. The more you become the person you want to be, the more you will draw people to you that are like-minded."
998,"I have not come across earth based Gamma ray telescopes.Cosmic rays (made mostly of protons 90% and alpha particles - 9%) are mostly created by supernovas, and sometimes by jets from blazars (active galactic neuclii -AGNs, whose polar jets are pointed at the Earth.) These are hard enough to detect; Cosmic rays will be absorbed by planets - with very little collateral radiation bounced off (and that too in the Gamma range). So it is highly unlikely to receive gamma rays reflected by an exoplanet with enough intensity to be able to detect it on earth.Regarding gamma ray reflections -Since cosmic rays are relatively rare, but a cosmic ray bust can be detected in a multi-square km area, Crayfis has been arming smartphones w/ cameras with an app for detecting cosmic rays: https://crayfis.io/about.It would probably be interesting to turn some datacenters (especially academic and government funded labs) into detectors as well, after all, neutrons in alpha particles in cosmic rays have been attributed to cause memory bit flips (leading to the use of ECC and interleaved memory.)"

1001,"I teach swimming from six months up to adulthood. Even though I teach parent-child classes because I cannot choose which classes I will and will not teach at my facilities, I do not recommend them. “Learn to swim” courses are very subtly different from “Parent-and-child aquatics” in that swimming strokes are really not taught at this level. It is really about getting comfortable in the water and bonding with the parents; the education is geared toward the parent so that they can encourage their child to learn.My suggestion is for parents (I am assuming parents who swim, not non-swimmers themselves) to skip this class and opt for spending time with their children in the water with them, showing them that you enjoy the water and care that they have fun in it too. It does not matter what you do with them; if you want an agenda, parent-child classes are essentially kicking on the front and back, trailing them behind you to let them glide, trying to blow bubbles, trying to paddle the hands. As long as they are getting comfortable in the water, they are accomplishing the goals of this class.(In Red Cross, there are overlaps between the levels. For example, someone who did Preschool classes might skip Learn-to-Swim level 1 onto level 2, as learn-to-swim starts with the same skills but at a school-age.)So I’d aim for 3–4 years old, skipping infancy onto the preschool years."

1004,"That depends on a lot of factors and many possible scenarios.The most common cause is the operator. Get someone who actually knows what they are doing and things may start working again.Another possible cause could be a blown speaker. A blown voice coil can short circuit or have much lower impedance.Another possible cause could be improper speaker connection and/or a set of speakers that do not match the amp impedance limit. Too many loudspeakers connected to the same channel, will do the trick if not properly connected in a series/parallel setup that will keep the impedance within the amps limit.Another probable cause could be “clipping” a form of distortion that will eventually blow the loudspeaker coils and after the amp end stage. Or when the amp has Clipping protection circuit.Another possible scenario could be heat. Improper amp ventilation can do the trick too (provided the amp has thermal protection circuit)Another possible scenario would be “amp starvation”. Improper power supply and grounding can do the trick.Another possible scenario could be faulty components in the amp either on the power supply or the end stage or bothThere are plenty of possible scenarios and it is difficult to point out one with the very small info you have on your answer. But, as I mentioned above, it all starts with the user. Change the user and things may change. Today people just want loud and louder.

1005,"There are mainly two type of peoples1.who loves maths…..These type of persons are very enthusiastic and curious about see the different type of maths problem and try to solve it no metter how challenging it is!!!Thus all who are very familiar with maths and their basic concepts and fundamental are clear once they have to try to find out that from where these concept came from ,why it is exist and how it's been proven and it's application.Now you are ready with perfect background of principle,theorem and formulas etc.Using all of these start working on as much problems as you can which is in your syllabus.Remember one thing that maths is never improve hand in your poket.Make a habit of writing problems in not books with perfection.sometimes you get a answer with a different techniques not down these techniques….its useful in MCQ type question!In paper always doing calculation based on marks.Math is subject where you have to maintain speed and accuracy both.Give full attention to problem and not down carefully what is given in exam,what is asked?Now by these method if your exam will be of 100 marks then you are work hard and by heart you damn sure get 95 to 97 marksNow you want perfect 100 here is your tipsyou have to predict that your paper examiner are one who don't know everything in maths.Because maths is subject where we can get a answer in many ways sometime which is not understand by every one.Actually during practice we have bed habit to skip some steps and directly get the answer. Never doing it during practice if you want perfect 100 you have write a single step which is needed to prove your answer correct.During exam we are so busy that our whole focus on getting answer. So when we are writing answers we don't look at How are we writing? Maths having a very big integration,series,derivatives etc. So try to writer maximum 3 terms in line next term in next line .These way you can also easily get answer and able to find out anything goes wrong easily.If ther is series in which sin,Sinh ..cos,cosh term will be there one line having only 2 term so when you have to cancle something it's easier.All symbols use properly like +,~,%,=,{,}[,] ,- etc.Your answer key should be neat and clean.Advantag of these tips is sometimes your are doing mistake and still somehow you get a right answer in that case examiner can only see you are answer and perfection you got a full marks.These way when somebody see your answer key it's look like everything nice clean and perfect .2. Who hate maths….I think these type of students are bored when they have to calculate somethings or they have a fear of maths.Basic maths not clear thought they practice maths problems they are very confuse what to do next because and after a long half hour they don't even solve a one easy problems.Without basics you can't doing anything.thus they have to start from the bottom. And then when you think you have little bit intrested then you gradually like maths afterwards you have to follow1.who loves maths"

1009,"Honestly, get over it.MOOCs are great because they open the content up to so many people. The teachers are trying to engage so many people at once that they have to be creative, innovative, and enthusiastic. They work hard to expand your mind, show you how awesome learning is, and use state-of-the-art technology to illustrate opaque concepts. It's like having a Michelin star chef offer you a small piece of a light, airy cheesecake that's rich and decadent with a vibrant fresh-picked ripe fruit topping that's bursting with flavor but not overly sweet. It melts in your mouth, isn't heavy, excites your tastebuds, and leaves you craving more.The problem here is that now it's hard to eat $0.10 ramen noodles after that. Even a decent pot roast will pale in comparison. The cheesecake was good enough that you've been ruined somehow because 99% of things you'll have will never measure up. You could try to only eat at Michelin restaurants now on, but you may not have the opportunity to do that. It's hard to accept, but now you may be facing a long hard stretch of culinary mediocrity.That's the best comparison I can draw to education. There are a lot of mediocre professors out there. Lots. Some do it because they like the material, some want to inspire, but some never wanted to go into the real world and love the safety of academia, and some didn't have a plan so they kept going to school until they couldn't anymore. MOOCs are usually given by teachers who wanted to teach and inspire and have a flair for presenting, not unlike a great chef. However, there are a lot of cooks and chefs that just make some decent dishes because they're paid to do it. End of story.The professors that teach MOOCs are genuinely excited about their materials. However, it's very different outside of that group. Some professors have been teaching the same class in the same way for *decades*. I personally learned from a senior professor that taught a 100 level engineering course to another senior professor when that one was an undergrad. He’d been teaching the basics for 40+ years. After 80+ semesters, the magic of the material is gone. There's no excitement left. How many semesters would it take you before you stopped seeing the material as exciting? It may be very nice to have professionally drawn graphics and learning content on perfect slides with beautifully styled fonts, but you're missing the point. The point isn't to entertain you, it's to educate you. If you're getting hung up on the presenting method, you're not focusing on the right thing.MOOC professors don't have the same pressures to grade their attendees’ work. I read the figure is 90% of MOOC attendees drop out of the course. Even if they do grade the work, there's no pressure for certification. Sure, a MOOC may give you a certificate, but is that enough to get a job with? I would think not. Most professors have to consider that the university would get a horrible reputation if they passed too many people that performed poorly in the working world. In the US, accreditation is everything and a school will do a lot not to lose its accreditation. A degree means a lot more than a certification.You've had a good learning experience with a MOOC. That's great. But come on, a traditional university course is *not* like you're being poisoned, like you said. The professor’s job is to teach the material, not to make it exciting and engaging. Lectures always beat the hell out of reading the textbook for me, even though I did my fair share of that. It may not have been the most fun or exciting, but I learned something, which was why I was there."
1010,"Binary search trees are collections that can efficiently maintain a dynamically changing dataset in sorted order, for some ""sortable"" type.*Having a sorted array is useful for many tasks because it enables binary search to be used to efficiently locate elements. The problem with a sorted array is that elements can't be inserted and removed efficiently.The binary search tree is a different way of structuring data so that it can still be binary searched (or a very similar procedure can be used), but it's easier to add and remove elements. Instead of just storing the elements contiguously from least to greatest, the data is maintained in many separate chunks, making adding an element a matter of adding a new chunk of memory and linking it to existing chunks.Binary search trees support everything you can get from a sorted array: efficient search, in-order forward/backwards traversal from any given element, predecessor /successor element search, and max /min queries, with the added benefit of efficient inserts and deletes. With a self-balancing binary search tree (BST), all of the above run in logarithmic time.* It can store any type that has a total order defined on it. A total order means a binary comparison operation between elements has been defined, and the elements can be arranged in a unique sequence from smallest to greatest based on this operation. For example, integers or reals with the typical (""natural"") order."
1011,"Hindustani and Carnatic music systems are comparable to two species that have evolved from a common ancestor. So it helps to describe the nature of their 'ancestor' first and then show how the two systems evolved into distinct branches.The common ancestor of Carnatic and HindustaniThe history of Indian music can be traced to 200 BC - 400 BC - when Bharatha Muni, a Musicologist, wrote down a basic theory of Music (and dance and drama) called ""Natya shastra'. Under this system:there were 22 notes in an octave.primtive elements of 'taal' or meter were also identified.the concept of 'sruti' was introduced to allow people to choose a convenient reference 'root' pitch based on the singers'/musicians' convenience.A set of 'bhavas' (or expressions) and 'rasas' (the evoked feelings) were identifed.A musical grammar theorized which of these 22 notes for any chosen 'sruti' will sound in harmony or in dissonance (somewhat similar to pythagorean rules, except this is all relative) with the sruti.Using these grammatical rules, primitive recipes called 'ragas' were formed each specifically designed to evoke one of the 'rasas' (or combinations thereof). These 'raga' recipes would comprise a chosen set of notes from the 22 total available notes.The ragas also evolved to prescribe many other details - such as how to transition from one note to another while ascending (aroh) and descending (avaroh) or what 'phrases' are quick formulae to evoke what specific complex derivative rasas.  Thus, with the formation of Natya shastra, the Indian system of music was set in motion. It is important to keep in mind that around this period India was a place of prosperity that welcomed travelers from across the world. Music kept evolving, organically as new cultures were met and assimilated.The speciation of Carnatic music / Hindustani musicAfter several years of the Mughals entering the nation, most of the then-existing Hindu kings had already been chased down south as the Mughal empire and culture spread across North India. The prevalent system of music kept constantly evolving under the 'selection pressure' of the mughal rulers - which had a persian/mughal bias. Somewhere around this time, a need was felt (by the hindu kings of the era) to 'standardize' the original musical system that used to be in existence[1]. Thus, if we imagined two kingdoms - the ""Hindustan"" (the one that was occupied by the mughals) and the ""Carnatic"" (the one occupied by the remaining hindu kings of the south). Hence the names ""Carnatic"" and ""Hindustani"".The way Carnatic and Hindustani diverged was mainly through an organized effort to make Carnatic ""different"", while Hindustani continued to evolve in myriad unorganized, organic ways.The effort took place in Thanjavur (then Carnatic empire, now Tamil Nadu) originating with Raghunatha Nayak stating something on the following lines[2]: ""The listener hearing the recitals by different musicians is certainly  puzzled to know what raga is being rendered as no two musicians sing the  same raga alike. There is such a diversity of rendering that one cannot  even recognize the well-known ragas. Most musicians, barring a few, do  not conform to the definition or grammar of each raga as expounded in  authoritative treatises. To put it bluntly, no musician seems to follow  the sangita sastra for there is no correlation between the lakshana and  lakshya and yet they call it Carnatic music.""Raghunatha wanted to have a standard to prescribe and preserve the ancient traditions. He wrote down the earliest draft of this in his book ""Sangita Sudha"". At this point, one Mr.Venkatamakhi, the son of Raghunatha's music teacher reads ""Sangita Sudha"" and gets influenced. Later, Raghunatha Nayak's son Vijaya Raghava Nayak undertook the task set forth by his dad to formalize and make ""Carnatic music"". He chose Venkatamakhi to do this work. Venkatamakhi comes up with the elegant ""Melakarta"" scheme.Further advances by the mughal empire forces the Carnatic form of music to evolve a ""hindu religious"" tradition and a form of ""hindu identity"". Around this time, the Trinity (Muthuswamy Dikshitar, Tyagaraja and Syama Sastri) besides the many other carnatic composers created tens of thousands of ""kritis"" or compositions. These compositions were mostly religious by nature and these compositions themselves defined Carnatic Music.Thanjavur becomes the capital of this tradition as the Maratha kings experiment fusion with western forms of music (king Serfoji who was well traveled marveled at the western method of music whose power, he rightly identified, was due its written form). He even set in motion an effort to give written notation to carnatic - but the effort gets abandoned as the british abolished princely states in one sweep.The carnatic artists and their families who had flourished in the ensuing 300 or so years of Carnatic's evolution, switched base to Madras to entertain their new western masters.In the early days of the formation of the ""Madras Music Academy"", performance traditions were experimented with by artists such as Ariyakudi Ramanuja Iyengar, Semmangudi Srinivasa Iyer and others where the format of a concert or the method of expounding and improvizing kritis were defined to a 'ticket buying' audience.All along, Hindustani music kept evolving Organically.[1] ""A Social History of Music in South India"" by Lakshmi Subramanian http://www.amazon.com/Tanjore-Co...[2] http://tamilartsacademy.com/arti..."
1012,Four things:Communicate with absolute clarity that the unity and integrity of India is non-negotiable. No discussion - No dialogue - Nothing grey or floating.Declare article 370 as invalid through an ordinance - let the state integrate with the rest of the country - just like all other parts of the nation.Remove AFSPA in stages - Give freedom and enable the local police and the administration to deal with separatism as a law and order issue (just like Punjab). Investigate and bring charge sheets in every alleged and actual case of atrocity reported - provide transparent justice.Simply release the internet search history and browsing data of the separatist leaders of Kashmir - dry up their illegitimate sources of funding - Continue to provide incentives for the regular people to live peacefully.India will never be divided on the basis of religion again - whatever be the cost.Thank you for reading. Cheers and peace.
1013,"Many have taken the view of Hardy that “mathematical reality lies outside of us, that our function is to discover or observe it, and that the theorems which we prove, and which we describe grandiloquently as our ‘creations,’ are simply our notes of our observations.“ This makes mathematics sounds like a science studying the natural world, and certainly we often speak of mathematical objects as it they are real objects that exist somewhere, but this view introduces the very hard questions of where does this mathematical reality exist and why is it that logical proof is our means of observing it.Others, especially more recently, have argued that mathematics is less like the natural sciences and more like the arts; that is, mathematical theorems aren’t discovered, they’re invented. This allows us to understand Weierstrass’s statement that “the true mathematician is a poet.” While capturing the sense of creativity present in producing modern mathematics, the idea that mathematics is entirely a human construct faces some serious challenges which are well communicated by Eugene Wigner in his remarkable paper, The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Mathematics in the Natural Sciences. If mathematics is a human creation, why does it do such a stellar job at describing the many diverse phenomena of the natural world? I find the idea of a garden very helpful. A garden is both discovered and created. The plants present existed in nature already, but the way in which they are brought together, arranged, and cultivated reflects the human gardeners.A similar story can be told of mathematics: we begin with ideas that appear very naturally within nature, then, as rational beings, we interact with creation by rationally extending these ideas.Perhaps, as has been said before, ""God gave us the integers, all the rest is the work of man."" Wherever you draw the line, it seems that parts of math (say, arithmetic) are in some sense forced upon us from the natural world, while there remains the clear sense that human freedom and creativity are involved as we handle and extend these ideas.Now, I believe Wigner was right that there remains a mystery here. Why are we able to handle these ideas in a way that doesn't lead us into a web of contradiction? Moreover, why does it remain useful in describing the natural world after human creativity has clearly had its role? For instance, the introduction of imaginary numbers were simply to satisfy the curiosity of mathematicians, and yet many have argued that modern physics cannot be formulated without imaginary numbers. We just thought them up, but they very well may be essential to understand the universe. Many other such examples abound, such as non-Euclidean geometry.It must be that just as we are deeply curious and creative, we are also deeply mathematical. And so is the universe."
1014,"L. Ron Hubbard was an unsuccessful sci-fi writer who was on record as saying “You don't get rich writing science fiction. If you want to get rich, you start a religion.” - interesting, then, that he went on to start a religion and get rich.He also invented a device to find out if tomatoes feel pain, that device evolved into the e-meter which Scientology uses to carry out “psychological evaluations”, known as “auditing"", on its victims. Oops, sorry, did I say victims? I meant followers.Scientology is known to charge immense amounts of money for its so-called spiritual enlightenment, it is known to use followers as little more than slaves (paying less than subsistence wages for immense hours of work), it determines which of its members may marry which and which may have children - this isn't me making shit up, this is me repeating what a large number of people who left the church have said. Hundreds if not thousands of people independently telling almost identical stories of abuse. Even Jenna Miscavige, the daughter of this alleged church's post-Hubbard leader David Miscavige, escaped the church and told of the horrors inside Scientology.Those who do leave and tell such tales are routinely subjected to psychological bullying and blackmail, often using personal info gleaned during “auditing”, which is their term for a so-called psychological consultation using a tomato scream recorder, sorry, wrong words again, I meant to say an e-meter.Scientology hates being investigated, many investigators and journalists who have tried are routinely subjected to the same bullying that church leavers undergo.Finally, despite denying that they are a cult, Scientologists echo one of the most common cult behaviours: seeking to separate followers from the two groups of people who might see what is going on and lure the followers out of the church, namely their family members who are outside the church, and psychologists.If there was ever a perfect recipe for bullshit, it would read like a check-list of facts about Scientology."

1018,"I see from the answers already here that there is ambiguity about what heat capacity refers to. Everyone agrees about specific heat. My own connotation of heat capacity is that is is the amount of heat needed to raise the temperature of an object by one degree. Specific heat would be the heat capacity divided by the mass of the object. So the two things have different units.Heat capacity is in, for example, J/KSpecific heat would be in J/kg-KThis link (heat capacity | physics) agrees with my interpretation, although it uses calories per gram instead of joules per kilogram. But conceptually these are the same.If you use the expression “heat capacity” I suggest making it clear which interpretation you mean in order to avoid the ambiguity. If you said “heat capacity of this substance” that would clearly mean specific heat, and if you said “total heat capacity of this object” that would also be fairly unambiguous, but if you said “heat capacity of this object” it might be interpreted by the listener as either. If you gave the units, then that would make it clear which one you meant."
1019,"— Thanks for A2A—***SPOILER ALERT***Basically, In the film Interstellar, The main characters are pursuing Plan B to save and protect the humanity/mankind, whereby a human colony will be established via frozen embryos. At the end, Brandt (Anne Hathaway) is left alone on the colony.Plan A :- The wormhole and gravitational anomalies are obviously artificial. This means that direct spacetime manipulation - true control of gravity - is possible. If this is the case, the energy cost of lifting things into space would drop dramatically. We could build immense starships that could simply float into the sky with antigravity devices. NASA then has two goals: first, to use data gathered from the gravitational anomalies to figure out how to control gravity (Dr. Brand's department), and second, to build the ship itself. If successful, all remaining humans could board the Station Fleet and depart for a new habitable planet on the other side of the wormhole.Plan B :- While gravity control seems to be possible, it may still be beyond the reach of our technology. In that case, the goal switches to saving humanity as a species, not the actual humans on Earth. The spacecraft Endurance will be sent through the wormhole carrying a ""population bomb"" of 5000 frozen zygotes along with the equipment necessary to create a self-sustaining colony. This colony, established on a sufficiently Earth-like world, will be the start of a new human civilization in the alien galaxy. Those on Earth will have to be left behind, as their case is hopeless.Unbeknownst to NASA and the crew of the Endurance, Professor Brandt (Michael Caine) never intended Plan A to be a viable option. He used Plan A as a means to motivate funding to NASA and to eventually leave the Endurance crew with no choice other than to implement Plan B.Professor Brandt considered Plan A to be impossible because in order to solve his gravity equation, he would need unobtainable data from the Singularity of a black hole. He wanted to to conceal this fact from everybody, including his daughter Amelia and Murph. For years he pretended to be attempting to solve the gravity equation with Murph, despite the fact he had previously determined it was unsolvable before the Lazarus Mission left Earth, ten years before the Endurance.On his deathbed, Professor Brandt finally admitted to Murph that Plan A was a ruse. This prompted Murph(Jessica Chastain) to send a message her father, accusing him of being aware of the lie and abandoning her to die on Earth. This proved to be a revelation to the entire Endurance crew, but not to Dr. Mann (Matt Damon).Then Cooper(Matthew McConaughey) and TARS sacrifice themselves to allow Dr. Brandt to begin Plan B on Edmunds' planet. TARS was tasked to enter Gargantua, glimpse the singularity, and relay the data back to Earth, giving humanity a chance to initiate Plan A. TARS was ultimately unable to transmit to Earth due to the black hole's immense gravity. However, Cooper and TARS entered the Tesseract and were able to relay the quantum data to Murph using the watch Cooper gave to Murph before leaving Earth. Plan A is implied to be successful as Murph's completion of Brand's gravity equation allowed the launch of very large space stations to depart from Earth, one being Cooper Station, named after Murph.Source : Google"

1023,"So its 25 December, day of Christmas and few days before NEW YEAR.Movie launched on the silver screens just at the right time. Yes out of all the Bollywood movies I saw this year, this movie really comes under a category to be appreciated .2016 was a year of BIOPICS!!! yes Sarbajit, M.S Dhoni and now DANGAL.I am not a movie critic but as an honest viewer I rate this movie 9/10.Yes I am rating it a bit high, but it deserves this score.I would like to list out the points I loved while watching this piece of cinematography.Starting from the starting, I loved the simple things shown in the movie, like a person adjusting the antenna to catch the signals, it reminded of the my childhood days.Best part is the narration in the movie, yes I fell in love with this idea of the director.The actor playing the dangal sister’s cousin have done a stupendous work.This movie exactly portraits how people in India in fact families are entangled in love,the care of her mother the sacrifices made by all the people around to help the girls grow.This movie is a combination of good jokes at times and full of emotional moments.The movie keeps your mind and heart intact till the end. One does not even loose interest after intermission.I loved the each and every small details displayed on the screen, like the house they live in, the attires worn by the cast. Yes the director looked into every small details.And yes this movie is not a waste of money at all.This movie is very inspiring if one tends to get inspired from the DANGAL SISTER’S.The songs are apt to the script. And dialogues written are too good.I guess I need no points to mention about Aamir Khan, his performance is as usual the best one gets to see once at the end of year.I loved the subject that how difficult it is for the father to be coach and parent at the same time.“ Well, people still planning to watch this movie go out spend a little and watch it on a big screen.”“PAISA WASOOL MOVIE HAI”I wish we get to see such movies in 2017 also :P"

1026,"Based upon what you’ve stated in the details of the question, you must be feeling very ill and uncomfortable. And I hope that by the time of this response, that you were able to seek out the assistance of medical professionals that have helped get these serious symptoms under control and you’re feeling better. Soliciting assistance from an online community for urgent health matters is not the most efficient way to get relief and on the road to your normal good health. Fever and pain should not be allowed to linger or progress and those two things alone are enough to warrant medical advice.Urinary Tract Infection (UTI) is a common occurrence for women who are having, or recently following their menstrual cycle. Doctors say that theoretically “no” there isn’t a correlation between the UTI and menstruation, but most women who have studied this topic tend to disagree with what doctors report. And, older women who have passed the age of menstruation and younger girls who have not had their first period are also frequently afflicted. Nearly 10 million doctor visits each year, world wide, are due to different urine infection symptoms.A UTI has the hallmark symptom of a frequent urge to urinate and if the urge is followed by actual elimination, because often the urge will only a produce a few drops, the elimination of urine will bring on a burning sensation and it may be red or cloudy in nature. Often experienced is a change in the smell or a bad odor from the urine. Some patients also experience pain in the lower abdomen and back.When a UTI progresses and moves from the bladder, to also affect the kidneys (Pyelonephritis), the additional symptoms of fever and chills, body aches and pains, and possible nausea and vomiting will occur. This is a serious condition and medical attention is needed as soon as possible.It is important to quickly diagnose and treat a possible UTI. If you haven’t done so already, please see a medical provider. Your healthcare provider can run a quick test in the office to determine the presence of bacteria in the urine and then discuss with you the need for a urine culture. Tests strips of this type are also available over the counter in the US, but this is only for diagnosis and not treatment. A bacterial culture of the urine is the most effective way to determine the proper antibiotic necessary to clear the infection from your system. Use of an antibiotic targeted for the type of bacteria causing the UTI, will deliver the best results.When you’re feeling better, take a look at this very helpful website covering all the things anyone would need to know about UTIs: Urine Infection or Urinary Tract InfectionsI hope you’re feeling better soon and can then begin the search for a combination of food and supplements and hygiene that will keep future UTIs from reoccurring."
1027,"Fast metabolism system can be reason behind this. You must consume more calories than average person. Eat protein rich, carb and essential fats containing food.You must follow this :- Best Diet Plan To Gain WeightAlso Read:- Top 5 Yoga Poses To Gain Weight That Actually WorksSome more methods and tips to gain weight:-1. Know ThyselfNo one likes to count calories, but one of the fastest ways to gain weight is to know how many calories you need, and how much you are eating on a daily basis.I’ve heard many skinny guys – and girls – say that they are eating so much, yet they cannot seem to go up in weight.The problem is almost always that they are eating too few calories. A great way to keep track is to use a free service called FitDay.You don’t have to keep counting calories forever, but if you do it for a few days, you will see how much you’re getting.If you want to gain weight, use this formula: 18 x (bodyweight in lbs). If you weigh 130 pounds, that means you should be getting at least 18 x 130 = 2340 calories on a daily basis.2. Lift Heavy ThingsIf you just eat more, you’ll get fat, and I hope that’s not your goal.One of the best ways to increase your weight gain is to lift weights. Yes, that includes women. Lifting weights is healthy and it helps you get a fit body.If you’re afraid of getting big muscles, don’t worry, you won’t.When you put pressure on your muscles – and your whole body – you will naturally become hungrier, and you will have a much easier time eating more food.3. Eliminate CardioOne of the best ways to gain weight fast is to sit on your ass all day, except for the times when you’re lifting weights.That’s not always practical, but you definitely do not want to add in any running or excess cardio, because it will only keep you from putting on more weight.You will get plenty winded from your weight training, so no worries on the health side.4. Eat BreakfastIt’s easy to skip breakfast. I remember when I weighed 20-30 pounds less. I skipped breakfast consistently, or I just had some toast with jam or something similar.Get your body used to eating something big for breakfast, such as eggs and bacon, an omelet with minced meat, or anything that packs calories.It may feel weird in the beginning because you’re not used to it, but your body will adapt, and so will you, because you will start feeling better almost immediately.5. Eat More OftenThis is a no-brainer, right? Eat more often and you shall gain lots o’ weight!It does sound simple, I agree, but most people don’t do it. The fact of the matter is that you have to stuff yourself if you want to gain weight fast.We skinny people are used to eating less and we have fast metabolisms, so we have to get our body used to weighing more and eating more.A simple way to do that is to eat every 2-3 hours.6. Eat NaturalAll of this does not mean you have the license to consume all the junk and processed food you want.Well, you could do that, but your health would suffer.What you want to do is stick to natural foods, such as grass-fed beef, organic chicken, wild fish and game, fruits, vegetables, yams, and sweet potatoes, just to name a few options.All that new weight is of no use if you aren’t healthy.7. Avoid the UnnaturalI’m talking about cookies, candy, ice cream, hamburgers, pizza, and the gang.Now, it’s okay to eat your favorite foods now and then. It’s not like you’re trying to lose weight, which is when you should be even more strict, so here and there is fine.I personally prefer pizza over candy. Pizza isn’t healthy, but sugar is even worse.8. Blend Your FoodOne of my favorite ways to get more calories is to simply blend a lot of stuff and chug it down.A simple smoothie you can make that is easily closing in on 1000 calories is:3 Bananas2 Scoops of Protein Powder (optional)BerriesPeanut butter2 Raw eggsCoconut milkAmazingly delicious and full of weight boosting calori..."

1030,"Not really. For example, I am “legally blind” meaning that I have a corrected visual acuity of 20/200 in the better eye and a visual field of less than 20 degrees.I can read the computer screen, but I cannot see faces. I can walk with a cane, but I cannot drive. Total blindness is not as rare as all that, but it is not common either. Many blind and legally blind persons have some sight, such as the ability to see shapes and colors, but without enough clarity to read. Others might see clearly and sharply, but only a tiny pinhole of vision, so that they must read (if they can) one l___e___t___t___e___r______a___t______a______t___i___m___eand some can only see faint shadows of grey on black with only vague light perception.An explanation of the numbers here… 20/20 is normal vision. You can see, at 20 feet, what nearly everybody can at 20 feet. 20/200 means that what normally sighted persons can see at two hundred feet away, I must get up to twenty feet to see. You might br able to read a street sign at the end of the block, from the *other* end. I need to get up to the base of the pole the sign is on.There is also “prosopagnosia” or “Face blindness” I believe that it is caused by an injury to the brain *or* a blind infant passing the “window” of time in which they learn to recognize faces. As a newborn, I spent two months or more sealed in an incubator, with masked nurses caring for me. There is a neurological “learning window” of time in which an infant learns that two dots, a line and a curved line are a “face” :-D and they learn that faces represent people. Mommy’s face is not Daddy’s face. Sister’s face looks different than Granny’s face. I never got that. All faces were amorphous blurs, and the masks they wore prevented me from seeing more than just eyes. Fuzzily, at that. As a child, once I was able to talk, I consistently referred to EVERYONE as “mommy” because I had NO idea that there were *different* people. I thought I was seeing only one or two persons and that was all there was! It wasn’t until I got my glasses at age 3 or 4 that I realized that there were many many people! But they all had the same face. Sadly, to this day, I fail miserably at identifying celebrities. So there are as many differences in blindness, legal blindness and impaired vision, as you can imagine."

He has often been at loggerheads with the Congress for being realistic and stating obvious facts when it was the only right thing to do. His books pax India and a dozen more are phenomenal. Hear him speak. His voice mean, you would just know, he means business. And an overall personality that I wish Indian politicians had. Some have but then again.2) A poet cum politician, Vajpayee ji is a man of esteem. His young days were spent in the Sangh, taught of Core and strong Hindu ideologies, but he didnt never shied when time needed him to declare otherwise. He was recognised as a future PM by Shri J.L.Nehru. The man who donned the cap of Indian PM three times. An orator. A realpolitik man. He knew how to forge coalitions, means NDA 1999-2004 stands testimony( 29 something parties). He definitely makes up my list."
1032,"There are a couple of ways to write probabilities. Frequently it’s a number ranging from 0 to 1, where 0 = can’t happen and 1 = certain to occur. Using this range is convenient for calculations.You can also write probabilities as percentages. 0% = can’t happen, 100% = certain to happen. These are harder to work with, but are more intuitive for most people.So a probability of 0.5 (expected to occur half of the time) is the same thing as 50% probability, as you would expect."
1033,"Social anxiety is one of the most common anxiety disorders. The statistics show that 13% of adults in USA have experienced social anxiety in their lives. It is a condition which often is mistaken with shyness but it actually goes beyond it. A person who suffers from social anxiety basically experiences fear when among other people and in situations of exposure. Often people with social anxiety fear that they will be embarrassed, they will do something that will be judged by others.Common SymptomsNervous stomachSweaty handsTremblingDry mouthPalpitationsShortness of breathHyperventilationWhen faced with the anxiety of the situation, some people will shut down and be very quiet while others will become very loud, outgoing and expressive. People with social anxiety disorder will take extreme measures to avoid or escape the triggering situations.Additionally, they may utilize a list of negative coping skills like use of alcohol and other drugs excessively to reduce symptoms."

1036,"I don’t talk about personal politics on public forums; instead, I will stick to facts as much as possible. In short, everything below I believe to be true, but not everything I believe is true is written below. (-:It’s far too early to know for sure exactly what the impact will be. As of this writing (mid-Nov 2016) we don’t even know who is going to be in key policy positions. Then, we don’t know how the Senate and House will react to their policy views. We don’t know how much party-line—crossing there will be; likely very little for the most part, but that is harder to predict if a policy is clearly prejudicial or damaging to the economy at large.Now, in terms of impact, there are personal impacts and job impacts.In terms of job impacts, it seems highly unlikely that anyone who is well-educated will do poorly in the short term. The US has tremendous economic opportunities for people who are skilled in high-value fields. Those companies are not going to fill their jobs out of nowhere. If the government starts to put in place policies that make it difficult to hire talented employees, companies will take those positions to where the employees are — abroad — creating exactly the opposite situation of what Trump promised when he ran. Of course, politics rarely follows along strictly rational lines of calculation, but ultimately it’s therefore important to separate bluster for the press versus what actually happens quietly in the background.Keep in mind, also, that if the job market does change by the time you graduate, unless the Revolution comes, you’re hardly the one who will be impacted. Anyone who is willing to pick up sticks, move half-way around the world, deal with differences in language and food and climate and a dozen other things, is likely going to have a place somewhere in the world. Getting a quality education can only help that.In terms of personal impacts, it might depend quite a bit on what you look like — in some locations. However, the vast majority especially of US research universities are not located in the places that are also appear to be the most prejudiced. Indeed, this election further widened the gap between urban and rural areas, and urban areas resoundingly voted for a more global perspective. A student at Brown doesn’t live in the USA as much as they live in Providence, a vibrant, multi-cultural town with numerous nationalities and races represented broadly. Inasmuch as you think the vote for Trump says anything, only about five states gave Clinton a higher percentage of vote (and not by much) than Rhode Island. So to someone who lived here, on a day-to-day basis, there would hardly be any perceptible difference in treatment. If anything, at this moment many people are especially sensitive and careful about how they treat others.It is also easy to forget how much progress has been made in the US. People reading about the election from a distance, getting news dominated by Trump, might be surprised to hear that in this election season, the US has voted in [list courtesy Brighten Godfrey]:Stephanie Murphy (FL) — first Vietnamese-American woman elected to CongressCatherine Cortez Masto (NM) — first Latina elected to U.S. SenatePramila Jayapal (WA) — first person of South Asian descent elected to House of RepresentativesKamala Harris (CA) — first person of South Asian descent elected to U.S. SenateIlhan Omar (MN) — first Somali-American legislator (she was elected to the state house of representatives)Kate Brown (OR) — first openly LGBTQ governorTammy Duckworth (IL) — first female senator that has seen combat, and second Asian-American female senatorSamuel Park (GA) — first openly gay man in the Georgia legislatureand so on. I bet those stories were not covered in the international press. Note that Ilhan Omar is openly Muslim, and even wears a hijab. There are many Muslim countries where she could not even stand for election.Finally, just remember that eight years ago the USA voted in its first black president. Things go in cycles. History is long, and bears reading.Personally, I’m pretty confident I could mail out my resume to a bunch of different countries and get pretty positive responses. (When something happens in the US, I get notification from foreign friends of job postings at their university….) Let’s just say I haven’t dusted off my vita at all. In time, I think most things heal themselves. In the meanwhile, I’m committed to doing what I can to improve the education of students and state of knowledge—the very same things I was committed to the day before the election."

Book it on single occupancy.If you're booking it on double occupancy then straight away ask the question. (About your Gf stay)Check in in arrival date and request the front desk staff to see duty manager, ask duty manager that you have a guest visiting and you want to change the booking form single to double occupancy.When you're going uest/Gf arrives get herself checked in , you'll have to give the ID proof of her as well, (it's a mandatory process) pay for extra occupancy and go to your room and enjoy the time .Believe me the hotel staff doesn't have anything to do with your personal life.few of the international chains who are present in almost every metropolitan in India and also at all the tourist attractionsThis seems to be a biggest problem I have noticed,since I started using quora, Not only in Mumbai or Bangalore but all the places in India you will encounter same problem.Let's see One exampleAn unmarried couple go to a Hotel, Both have ID card they take a room and enjoy the time.Now they broke up, whatever is the reason.Following may be the result.1-Girl files a rape case on the boy.2-Boy have recorded the time spent together in his cellphone and puts it on net.3-Girl is a pro. And starts blackmailingIn all the cases hotel management will have to run around police though they are not at fault.Moreover due to security reasons all the hotels in metros such as Delhi Mumbai Bangalore etc remains on high alert (thanks to our neighbouring countries)& police can come and check the hotel(generally smaller or cheaper hotels, 5 star hotels have already a very tight security)If you have enough luggage with you and have proper prior reservation in a standard hotel. There are less chances that you are denied.I work in hotels and have seen unmarried couples in almost all the hotels ,even have seen many guest coming often but with a different partner every time(male/females both) If you are a legitimate guest in the eyes of hotel management then you will get the accommodation easily whether you are married or unmarried"
1038,"Love contracts are non institutional practices that are taking shape around USA, now. I am not sure whether that is prevalent anywhere else.I am not sure whether such marriages are rational, since rationality and ethics are all part of natural world, not of supenatural world of God centered life, where the values are spiritual love, belief, faith in each other, loving and living for each other, not asking any questions, not being suspicious, not being selfish and so on.In the contractual type marriages it is suspicion or lack of faith in each other that make them sign contracts before getting into any relationships. The presence of suspicion itself make it go out of the spiritual and institutional area to degenerate relationships even before the marriage has taken place. It is like politics taking precedence over love and care for each other from where health families form.So what goes on is probably something like political arrangements where for selfish reasons people come together and part also for the same reason, no rationality involved per se. Everything in the world nowadays happen not based on institutional values, but for politics and power based needs of individual and groups. So is this too."
1039,"There are two definitions of “evolution” that we need to distinguish here, plus subsidiary concepts that are intimately related.One is “biological evolution”: that heritable traits exist in biological organisms, and that the distribution of these traits changes over generational time.This is an observed fact.Further to that, over considerable time (think of geological time scales), the changes that accrue can be considerable; the fossil record attests to this fact, as well as numerous other lines of independent evidence.Two is “mechanisms of biological evolution”: for instance, evolution by natural selection, genetics, proteomics, etc., which are all aspects of the “theory of evolution”.This is a framework of well-tested (implied: well-supported) hypotheses that explain observations relating to the first definition.The latter, together, and because they are well supported by evidence, is the theory of evolution. It is a model that explains what we objectively observe and predicts things we are yet to observe — in character and quality, if not always in precise detail.Because we don’t know everything perfectly — that is, because the theory of evolution is a model — its collection of hypotheses is always under varying degrees of refinement, though the core concepts are very well understood and very well fixed; it’s mainly at the edges of our knowledge that things may need to be refined. We cannot preclude that some new discovery will not shake the boat, but we can put reasonably long odds on such a an event.We can certainly rule out the rantings and ravings of professional young earth creationists: they are poison to science, to grounded religious faith, and to society, and I won’t entertain them further than necessary in this answer.Evolution the observed fact has been proven precisely because it has been objectively observed, and anyone with a wish to do so may take the definition of evolution-the-fact (not some distorted version that shifts the goalposts in some unscrupulous way — poison to the mind) and see that heritable changes occur and propagate on observable time scales. As with many things in science, you have to look closely and carefully — and clearly — which is why science is not always easy.Evolution-the-theory is “proven” in the sense that it has advanced through collective effort on the part of both impartial and hostile critics and accumulated evidence in support and survived tests that should have falsified it. Its core ideas are sound (based on the observed fact), and when wrong ideas about it have been proposed, they have, over time (and through the effort of rigorous investigation) been rejected (or more likely refined). Through the same effort it will continue to be refined."

1042,"Some of the common, everyday exothermic reactions may surprise you…RustingThe process of rusting is one;-4 Fe + 3 O22_{2} + nH22_{2}O -—-> 2 Fe22_{2}O33_{3}.nH22_{2}O + HeatRust you say? That doesn’t get hot.Well heat is definitely produced when iron rusts, only the reaction is so slow and the amount of heat involved is so small that it’s unnoticeable to the human senses, due to the much larger temperature fluctuations caused by the weather. However, if you contained the rusting piece of iron in a closed, insulated container you could measure the temperature. It would be a small increase in temperature, but an example of an exothermic reaction all the same.Setting of CementAnother example of an exothermic reaction that is often missed, is the reaction of cement with water. In this reaction di- and tri-calcium silicates and calcium aluminate react with water to form hydrates of these minerals, giving off heat in the process. The fact that cement setting can liberate heat is the reason that large concrete structures such as large dams cannot be poured too quickly in a large volume, otherwise the heat generated within the massive structure will cause the setting concrete to crack. The construction of the Hoover Dam is good example of this.Epoxy ResinMost two-part epoxy resins will get noticeably hot when mixed, especially large batches. Heat is produced as new bonds form during the polymerisation reaction of the resin. In fact, in some cases the resin can get so hot as to cause thermal degradation of the resin itself, if the temperature is not controlled.QuicklimeLime is often used in the garden as a soil conditioner. This lime is called hydrated lime, or calcium hydroxide. (Ca[OH22_{2}]). Hydrated lime is produced from quicklime ( or calcium oxide, CaO) by the following equation;-CaO + H22_{2}O ——-> Ca(OH)22_{2} + HEATIs just the right ratio of rater is added to the quicklime, this reaction can liberate so much heat that it boils off all of the water in an almost explosive reaction.Spontaneous Combustion.Finely-divided organic material stored in large enough piles can be oxidised slowly by air permeating the pile. If the heat from this oxidation cannot escape from within the pile it will build up and cause the oxidation reaction to increase in speed, eventually producing a smouldering fire which is called “spontaneous combustion”.Spontaneous combustion can occur in piles of moist, loosely-stacked grass, hay or leaves… or even a rubbish bin full of oily rags. Some coal stockpiles can also spontaneously combust if not stacked correctly (i.e. compressed with a bulldozer to exclude the air)Thermite Reaction.You don’t see this one very often, (unless you work on a railroad repair team) however it’s still used in every-day track maintenance world-wide, as a rapid method of welding the ends of steel railway tracks together, especially in remote track locations.There are many types of thermite mixtures with different applications, but the basic thermite is produced from a finely powdered mixture iron oxide and aluminium powder;-Fe22_{2}O33_{3} + 2Al ——-> 2Fe + Al22_{2}O33_{3} + a whopping amount of HEAT!So much heat is produced by this reaction that the iron produced in the reaction reaches well over its melting point and welds the ends of the railway tracks together.…. and last, but not least….The Human BodyMany of the thousands of chemical reactions occurring within your body right now are exothermic reactions. These provide the energy for all warm-blooded animals to survive.So, in reality, every-day life itself is exothermic…."
1043,"Many people think there are two competing schools of thought about interpreting the Constitution, “originalism” or “living constitutionalism.” For those that believe originalism is the only correct interpretative method, your beef really begins with John Marshall and Marbury v. Madison. People are free to believe what they like, but the truth is that originalism, living constitutionalism, and other methods of interpreting the constitution have made their way into constitutional law and in precedent, regardless of people’s beliefs.Justice Louis Brandeis managed to bring these two competing philosophies, which scholars sometimes refer to today as “living originalism.” Brandeis believed that the values of the founders were immutable, but had to be translated into a very different world in light of dramatic changes in society, technology, and economics. There's an amazing passage in his opinion in Olmsted v. United States, where he doesn't mention television explicitly, but he refers to it implicitly:The progress of science in furnishing the government with means of espionage is not likely to stop with wiretapping. Ways may someday be developed by which the government, without removing papers from secret drawers, can reproduce them in court, and by which it will be enabled to expose to a jury the most intimate occurrences of the home. Advances in the psychic and related sciences may bring means of exploring unexpressed beliefs, thoughts and emotions.Brandeis advanced the idea that we must take the values embedded in the constitution and apply them in light of the evolution of technology and other major changes in society. At the time of the framing, you had to beat down someone’s door and riffle through their private papers to invade their intellectual privacy. Today, new technologies allow you to see far more than the hated general warrants and writs of assistance that inflamed the American Revolution. So Brandeis is challenging us to take the framers values, translate them in light of these new technologies and make them our own."

1046,"Having re-asked on this question…an answer to “Is it theoretically possible to travel a light year in under one year due to length contraction and other relativistic effects? is perhaps:With ‘other relativistic effects’ its ‘theoretically possible’ to do anything almost.But rather than theoretical, lets stick with reality for your question.Length contraction is Length Contraction: to us/observer “ the length of objects moving at relativistic speeds undergoes a contraction along the dimension of motion. An observer at rest (relative to the moving object) would observe the moving object to be shorter in length.Speed of Spaceship Observed Length Observed HeightAt rest	 200 ft	40 ft10 % the speed of light	199 ft	40 ft86.5 % the speed of light	100 ft	40 ft99 % the speed of light	28 ft	40 ft99.99 % the speed of light	3 ft	40 ftEnd Quote. In summary, its difficult for us the see things going light speed, but using length contraction as justification would be difficult to theorize to change the speed able to travel a lightyear faster or under one year…. regardless of how the object is observed by observer (appearances mean nothing, haha), the speed and distance to travel one lightyear would not change (logically).Another way to analyze your length contraction question is with the light cone. The lightyear is the distance light travels in a year. And if the speed of light is constant, its travel is constant with time: the light=cone is correlating to the time-line in the center of the light cone. Length contraction does not effect the light path’s length (distance=lightyear), rather length contraction effects the traveling object’s appearance to the observer. Other relativistic effects is a bit different…. another topic for another day perhaps.hope that helps,douG"
1047,"What revenue do I need to show to sell my company for a million dollars?By PeterTaradash.com also at EdenPress.comThere are quite a few variables. Let’s start with a simple theoretical case that doesn’t exist in real life. You have a product or service that sells the same amount every year. The price never changes. The profit of your company is constant and never changes. There is no competition. The costs of production and taxes never change. The staffing costs are also constant and never change. It is not a one man show that is valuable only or mainly because you are running the company. There is no risk that your product will go out of fashion or be declared illegal.On the other hand, there is little or no chance of growth of sales, nor profits.In today’s market a net cash flow (and after tax profit) of around $280,000 per year would probably give your company a value of about $1 Million. If any of the factors above were changed, that would affect the value.The most important single factor would be your growth rate. If your net profit was doubling every year for the past few years and it looked like that dynamic growth would continue, with good marketing o investors, you could probably get $10 million with the same earnings.If your earnings were declining every year, it might be hard to sell your company at all .Under two times earnings, around $500,000, would be about right with revenues of $280,000 and declining—- IMO (In My Opinion)."

1049,"Sometimes people come into your life and you know right away that they were meant to be there, to serve some sort of purpose, teach you a lesson, or to help you figure out who you are or who you want to become. You never know who these people may be (possibly your roommate, neighbor, teacher, fraternal brother or sister, long lost friend, lover, or even a complete stranger), but when you lock eyes with them, you know that at that very moment they will affect your life in some profound way.And sometimes things happen to you that may seem horrible, painful, and unfair at first, but in reflection you find that without overcoming those obstacles you would have never realized your potential, strength, willpower, or heart.Everything happens for a reason. Nothing happens by chance or by means of good luck. Illness, injury, love, lost moments of true greatness, and sheer stupidity all occur to test the limits of your soul. Without the small tests, whatever they may be, life would be like a smoothly paved, straight flat road to nowhere. It would be safe and comfortable, but dull and utterly pointless.The people you meet who affect your life, and the success and downfalls you experience, help to create who you are and who you become. Even the bad experiences can be learned from. In fact, they are probably the most poignant and important ones. If someone hurts you, betrays you, or breaks your heart, forgive them, for they have helped you learn about trust and the importance of being cautious to when you open your heart. If someone loves you, love them back unconditionally, not only because they love you, but because in a way, they are teaching you to love and how to open your heart and eyes to things. Make every day count.Appreciate every moment and take from those moments everything that you possibly can for you may never be able to experience it again. Talk to people that you have never talked to before, and actually listen. Let yourself fall in love, break free, and set your sights high. Hold your head up because you have every right to. Tell yourself you are a great individual and believe in yourself, for if you don’t believe in yourself, it will be hard for others to believe in you. You can make your life anything you wish. Create your own life and then go out and live it with absolutely no regrets. Most importantly, if you love someone tell them, for you never know what tomorrow may have in store. And finally, enjoy looking forward to learning a new lesson each day and enjoying the journey."

1051,"Today, something really strange happened with me.Every Sunday evening, I visit the local fruit market to replenish my stock for the coming week. Today was just like any other Sunday. As I left the silent lanes of my locality and stepped into the market, my ears were greeted with the rich background cacophony of a typical Indian marketplace. A million hawkers, shouting all at once in a mad rush to sell their produce, fighting a perpetual war with haggling aunties, other competing hawkers, not to mention, the hot evening sun of the fast approaching summer.The quintessential Indian market!As I moved through narrow pathways, weaving my way between the crowd, my mind began to wander. The new job I’d taken up, the girl I had had a mad crush on, the recent decision I’d made to become a full time writer - my mind wandered from one thought to another - like a strange white feather floating around in the breeze, it’s path aimless, it’s motion random, and yet you can’t shake the notion that it’s weaving an unseen pattern in the space, as if trying to tell you something.My reverie was suddenly broken by a coarse female voice, “Beta! zara sunna…” (Listen son…)Startled, I turned around. I saw an old woman, maybe in her sixties staring expectantly at me. She was wearing old tattered clothes. A strong pungent odor was emanating from her. Her face and hair were dirty, as if she hadn’t bathed in days. I had seen enough beggars in my life to know what was about to happen.“Beta, mera ghar Jhajjar mein hai. Me yahan apne bete se milne aayi thi lekin vo pata nahin kahin bahar gaya hua hai. Mera saare paise khatam ho gaye hain. Beta, mujhe apni maa samajh ke, bas bus ka kiraya de de… Apni maa samajh ke de de beta… Nahin to me ghar nahin jaa paungi…”(Son, my home is in Jhajjar. I came here to visit my son, but then I found out that he’s left for somewhere. I’ve exhausted all my cash. Son, consider me as your mother and please give me enough cash to buy a bus ticket home. Please think of me as your mom and help me out son, else I won’t be able to go home!)Ah! the classic bus ticket trap! As I said, I’d seen enough beggars in my life to know all their neat and crafty little tricks. I knew that this lady probably had collected enough money to buy a hundred bus tickets. No way I was gonna fall for this one.“Amma, hain nahin paise. Hote to de deta. Aap kisi aur se maang lo, ” I curtly replied. (I don’t have any cash. If I had some, I’d have helped you out. Please ask somebody else.)Her face drooped. I could tell that she was on the verge of tears. Yet, without giving a second thought, I turned my back towards her and walked away.I hadn’t even gone ten steps, when it suddenly hit me. What if she was genuinely in need! What if she really had no money to go home! For me, it might be a matter of mere hundred bucks but for her, it might make the difference between life and death.Now, it’s really important for you to understand that I never give money to beggars. Never. A few years ago, I was swindled out of a lot of money by a beggar in a strange city in the craftiest of way, and since then, I’ve made not giving money to beggars a core principle of my life. It has become second nature to me.But this time it was different. My own logic didn’t make sense to me anymore. It was as if the emotional part of my brain had suddenly taken control. What if she was really in need! What if…And just like that, something inside me snapped.I turned around and retraced my steps. She was nowhere to be seen. I started searching for her, frantically asking random people if they’d seen an old woman asking for a bus ticket. I searched and searched. But she was nowhere to be found. I deduced that being old, she probably couldn’t have gone far. So, I started randomly walking around the market, trying to catch a glimpse of her old, wrinkled face. But nothing. It was as if she had vanished from the face of the earth.It was half an hour and four rounds around the whole marketplace later, that I finally gave up hope. I had long forgotten about the fruits that I’d come to the market to buy. My mind was fixated on her dirty harrowed face, begging for a bus ticket to go home - the face that I knew would haunt me for a lot of the days to come.And as I made my way back home, I was struck with two powerful epiphanies -The world doesn’t exist in black and white. It’s all murky shades of gray.Sometimes, you don’t get a second chance to do the right thing.“Sometimes, you don’t get a second chance to do the right thing.”That’s the lesson I’ll leave you with.My new site - Vagabond… Ramblings of a Madman"
1052,"IodometryThe term “iodometry” describes the type of titration that uses a  standardised sodium thiosulfate solution as the titrant, one of the few  stable reducing agents where oxidisation of air is concerned. Iodometry  is used to determine the concentration of oxidising agents through an  indirect process involving iodine as the intermediary. In the presence  of iodine, the thiosulphate ions oxidise quantitatively to the  tetrathionate ions.To determine the concentration of the oxidising agents, an unknown  excess of potassium iodide solution is added to the weakly acid  solution. The iodine, which is stoichiometrically released after  reduction of the analyte, is then titrated with a standard sodium  thiosulphate solution (Na2S2O3)The term iodimetry, on the other hand, refers to titration using an  iodine solution and is useful for determining substances that have  reducing properties. The half-reaction is as follows:"
1053,"Well, as User said, yes. Sociopathy is a spectrum, so if you were literally hugging the psychopathic wall without jumping over into their garden, you could have completely psychopathic traits. However, don't confuse this with having all the traits of a psychopath, because many of their traits are only derived from zero empathy.Many sociopathic traits can be swapped out for one of another disorder or a normal person - the only real requirement is the lack of empathy. Nevertheless, there are traits that derive solely from a lack of empathy - prioritising of self-interests, lack of interests in other people's problems, disregard for rules and social norms etc - so, without them I don't see how a person could be a sociopath.I disagree with Jim Noblin's notion that almost all sociopaths have anxiety - that doesn't make sense. You can't live a life where you have a disregard for rules and other people yet feel apprehensive about what you are going to do. In the few instances guilt can kick in - if you can even call it that - it's when justification has been established but we wonder if it was the best course of action to take. It's barely guilt; more indeterminable retrospective conflict. It can be a bitch on the mind, too.As for some of your other remarks:I dunno where you heard that sociopaths aren't good at emulating emotions. What's actually true is that we can (somewhat), just as anybody can, but we don't usually see the need to. What does happen, however, is that regardless of outward appearance, we absolutely never believe that shit ourselves. The feeling inside is so hollow it's hilarious; you know just how much bullshit you are slinging in that very moment.Anger problems are nothing to do with sociopathy.Emotional triggers - I don't even know where you got this from to be honest. Sociopaths do have emotions and psychopaths do as well, but that's nothing to do with logical operation. Emotional reactions are what interfere with logic - this is what we both lack, psychopaths more than sociopaths.""Triggers"", however, do exist, and this is what causes rage. They are rare, they are few and they do exist, even if you haven't found them yet. Mine crept up on me while I was watching a music video and I didn't know wtf was happening. It's not a case of trivial shit like someone stepping on your toe and you turning into the Incredible Hulk."

1055,"When Ned Stark was building his lie to save Jon from Robert's hate, he knew that his story would be turned upside down and scrutinized endlessly by people who dealt in lies, people like Varys for example.So he covered all his bases. He had multiple stories leaked in various parts of Westeros and let them be embellished so as to become a rumour, which gets harder to discredit every time it is repeated. In addition, every time someone directed a comment towards him regarding how he had cheated on his wife, he didn't lash out; instead he opted to intimidate, giving an impression that the story was true and he was acting out of shame. In essence, he understood what people would want to see and he gave it to them unflinchingly till the day he died.Had Jon inherited his father's looks, which was unlikely given how, like the Baratheons' characteristics, the Starks have a characteristic look that is well established in their genealogy. People in the North even talked about Ned and Cat's children as favouring their mother's house in terms of their looks.And yet, if this had happened and Jon had silver-gold hair and purple eyes, that's where the Ashara Dayne rumour would have served Ned. In Dorne, it is widely believed that Jon is Ashara's son, conceived on the night that Ned came to return Dawn to Starfall. Ashara has purple eyes, pointing to a Targaeryen ancestry, probably through the female line. If Jon was born with Rhaegar's looks, Ned would maintain his silence and let other people's gossip do his work for him, proving the ""truth"" of the Ashara rumour and and that would keep Jon out of Robert's crosshairs."

Like Amazon's purchasing of Whole Foods. My prediction would be that the entire venture is a failure. My city has like 8 Walmarts. The whole foods shut down. There just isn't a big enough market for overpriced groceries.I think people shop online because it's cheap vs the mall. But when those online companies decide to build a storefront, it will kill their margins and negate any reason to shop there."
1058,"Most of what we hear or read about Napoleon is British view or the view of the victor.At the time of French Revolution Europe was ruled by Monarchs.These Monarchs rule came through Hereditary. It was assumed that through blood these being was superior to common folk. God has ordained them to be kings and queens. Churches assisted by teaching its followers about this. And Royalty paid back to Church by giving them vast lands and tax less income and no interference by King in religious affairs. Church and Monarchy were hand in glove in looting/enslaving common masses.Purity of blood is maintained by marriage within each other.So almost all royals marry amongst each other and hence they were related to each other. Some were first cousin or second cousin etc.French Revolution was bloody. Almost all royals were killed or have to fled France.Property of Catholic Church was taken over by Revolutionary government.Oppressed public was free. Life of a common man was better. He has a hope under new system. He can chose his ruler.Revolutionaries of other countries now can see toward France for inspiration. Freedom struggles were already going on in other European nations, now they got new vigour.So all European Monarchs wanted to punish France for this. They wanted to make it an example for all revolutionaries.They can't let it succeed at any cost. So they helped royalists to mount an attack on France. So France was attacked by combined armies of all Europe, it was besieged by British Royal Navy. It's commerce was effectively blocked. It's ports were pounded by Naval ships of opposing Nations. It's overseas colonies were overtaken by an alliance of anti revolutionary nations.It's a do or die situation for France. It's either Bourbon King or war with entire Europe.So Napoleon had no choice at the start of his career. He crushed the civil war in various parts of France. Pushed out the enemy out of France.Given this background I don't think there could be any peace between warring parties except a lull for preparing for next war. Or gathering another army.How many coalition armies he fought?And at last he was counquered and Bourbons were restored as rightful owners of France.It was a war between two ideologies, they cannot come to terms, it was impossible.Had Napoleon been a royal it would be different He could have reliable alliance. He was a disruption to the established order.For your answer :-He was trying to save French and his own Freedom.Viva la revolution.."

1062,"I was originally worried about ranking my sites and it was too difficult to learn about SEO. However I found a website where I learned much more about Search engine optimization and it's strategies. You'll find more information in this article. Not really a self campaign, but they helped me a lot so I want to give them a reference right here. Right now, I will explain in detail about your question.White Hat SEO refers to search engine optimization processes that respect search engine guidelines.White Hat SEO includes Search Engine Optimization (SEO) practices that enforce the guidelines of search engine providers such as Google , Yahoo! or Bing and thus do not violate them.The term white-hat-SEO comes originally from the English and consists of the terms ""white-hat"", so ""white hat"" and ""SEO"" together, which means as much as search engine optimization.This name was probably chosen based on a classic scene in old Western movies: Two cowboys are facing each other and are about to duel.The bad cowboy wears a black hat and the good cowboy wears a white hat.Therefore, the best practices in search engine optimization are referred to as white-hat SEO.The content of White Hat SEOBasically, search engine optimization aims to make your website better ranked in organic search results.And while black hat SEO is almost an exaggeration of these efforts and is characterized by the use of intensive spamming practices, such as the use of doorway pages , Russian links , cloaking or redirects, White Hat SEO takes advantage of these spam Practices distance and fully comply with the search engine guidelines.In general, White Hat SEO is primarily used when website owners want to make their online presence searchable for their users in the long term via search engines.Because natural link building on high-quality content, the search engine guidelines can be easily adhered to.However, the room for maneuver is beyond on- page optimizationrather limited here.So it happens that many online marketers with their SEO activities but often in the field of so-called gray-hat SEO.This means that while they do not deliberately violate policies through any spamming practices, they try to improve their ranking position, for example, by targeting external websites.This is also disliked by search engines, but it is more tolerated than activities within black hat SEO."

1065,"Neither will I write any diplomatic answer for this question, nor will I take an ungracious approach. I will be as much honest as I can.My content targets a wide range of audiencesSee, whenever you write any answer on a particular topic, you will only get upvote from those users who follows/interested in such topics.For an example:-An answer on “Diabetes” might get less views than an answer on “Motivation”.Life advice answers can reach wider audience than an answer on rocket science which involves your years of research and critical derivations and formula.You must be wondering, why?Let’s say, a person “X” is suffering from cancer and “Y” is suffering from diabetes. There might be less chance that “X” will ever read diabetic answer or vice versa.But they both need motivation to fight those diseases. So if you are writing an answer on a particular topic, it will engage only a particular group of people. But when you choose to write on wide range of topic, then it will be read by the mass.Simple LanguageThere is no need to show off your vocabulary skills. As you all know, Quora algorithm follows demographic structure.That is why my answer is mostly circulated among Indians. And the kind of diversity we possess, where English is not our first language, if people fail to understand your answer then they will never read it again.You can also google a few words and put those words in your answers to show off your skills, but you will fail miserably to connect with your readers.Stay away from click bait answersThese answers can give you upvotes but not respect. You will have to earn respect among your followers with your writing, not with click bait answers.To be honest, I have also written a few of such answers before, but once I had the realization, I deleted them. Maybe you can copy some jokes, or put lots of pictures from the internet, copy pasted content, but at the end of the day this is not your creativity.Be Original.If I can read that content from the internet then what is the point of reading yours and following you?Quality over quantityThis is the most important factor which I believe blindly on this platform. You must have seen that most of the times I delete my answer within a few hours, irrespective of thousands of upvotes.The only reason behind it is that I always felt that those were not quality content. You need to set one benchmark and never compromise with your writing.Fearless WritingWell, my anonymity helped me a lot. And once you reach a certain height on this platform then there is one common fear among us:Getting Banned from Quora.And people start compromising with their content so that they can “please” the mass here.I have a simple rule, I don’t owe you anything then why would I listen to your argument? I write to satisfy my ego, I am not here for entertainment.And even if I get banned from this platform, this is not the end of life.Stay away from controversiesIt is not necessary that everyone will like me, and of course there are few people whom I don’t like. But, I never involve myself into any kind of public bitching. Of course I am no saint, I abuse them, roast them but within my friend circle.There are a few people who hate me and at the same time there are huge mass who loves me. So, there is no point of discussing people who are here for trolling.If you are serious about writing, then write. Prove your writing skills without getting involved in those controversies. Otherwise, you will lose your account unnecessarily.Jealousy or Envy will lead you nowhere.Help People without any expectationSee, it is not possible for me to help every individual on Quora. I get tonnes of messages and it is impossible for me to reply to everyone or give personal assistance.So what I do is that I listen to their problem and write answers on it. It fulfills two purposes simultaneously:-I try to solve their problem with my answers.If anyone is suffering from same problem, then they don’t have to ask me again. It saves lots of time.And whenever I receive these type of messages, truly I get hell lot of satisfaction."
1066,"There is no possible statistical model that would have had an error margin of under 500 votes in Florida. Completely unpredictable factors like the Palm Beach “butterfly ballot” that led hundreds of voters to mistakenly vote for Buchanan instead of Gore would intervene. Not to mention the multiple post-election events in the recounts and court cases. So the best even an ideal model could have done would be to tell you that it was a very tight race and about 50/50 for each major candidate.Of course, if there had been a high-profile website like 538 making a credible argument that Florida could come down to mere thousands of votes, that might have led to more strategic voting in Florida. If just a few percent of the people who in reality voted for Nader had strategically switched their vote to a “useful” one for major candidate, and if Gore had gotten any more of those than Bush, that would have been enough to swing the outcome. Which gets at one of the things that’s so hard about modeling human behavior; the model itself can change that behavior."
1067,"Thankfully due to the probable reason that Srilanka is an Island with no Islam state within the perimeter of thousands of miles on each side of it. Sri lanka was only invaded by South India in its early history and was later by Dutch, Portugese and English. Anyone who needed to reach Srilanka with an army either had to have good naval strength or had to reach it through South India which was a predominantly Hindu state back then just as it is now. Eventhough Muslims are famous in commercial work and warfare in a global scale they are not a race associated much with Engineering.History of Muslims in Srilanka do not generally run farther back than the arrival of Portugese in the country. When they did I believe the main concern of Muslims became safeguarding their trade from the new opponents whom forced a constant threat to Muslims in every opportunity they got. In fact all the colonial nations that arrived in Srilanka since 1505 AD were constantly competing with the Muslims to take all the commercial activities un to them. Thus Muslims whether they liked it or not had to support the Sinhala Buddhist kings and seek to their protection in return.And who knows, as early as fifth century AD, the great historical chronicle of Srilanka mentions that Lord Buddha gave his blessings to the Island in his passing away and made a prophecy that Srilanka will be a protector of Buddhism for thousands of years to come. Perhaps it is this blessing of the Buddha that kept Buddhism alive even at the face of innumerable invasions through out its history due to its strategical location on the globe.If Muslims had no chance to grab the power of Srilanka in the past they stand even less chance now I believe. Buddhism survived even at the hands of powerful British empire and at its independence Srilankan constituition was formed to give Buddhists the priority. Only a Buddhist can become the president, prime minister and the heads of 3 forces and police in the country now.I don’t think no other powerful nation in the world like India, China and the West would like Srilanka being ruled by any other global nation. Why? Due to it’s extremely important location in the world map. As long as it is ruled by the Sinhalese who are an extreme minority group in the world everyone will sleep better I suppose."
1068,"WhatsApp is a messenger that aims to replicate the SMS experience, but avoid the expense of SMS.  Part of what makes SMS popular is that it rides on top of the phone numbers that you can also use to make a phone call.  So you can exchange a phone number with someone, and then you have a choice of reaching that person via a telephone call, or an SMS text message.  WhatsApp expands on that idea, so that you can now also reach a person via WhatsApp if you have their phone number.   This phone number matching done by WhatsApp is not some optional feature -- it's a core aspect of using WhatsApp, as there is no other way of finding people than having their phone number.Once you have found someone to talk to on WhatsApp, the mechanism of chatting is pretty straightforward. The simplest phrase for WhatsApp is that it is a ""store and forward"" system.  This happens at a couple of places.  The WhatsApp client will store any message you send, and keep trying to send it to the WhatsApp servers.  This behavior varies somewhat by platform, as some mobile platforms do not allow arbitrary code execution, and this restriction can be visible to the user at times - this is most obvious on the iPhone and Windows Phone platforms, as apps have very restricted access to the CPU when not in the foreground.    On other platforms, like Android, BlackBerry, BlackBerry-10, Symbian and Nokia S40, the OS allows background execution, so the user experience is substantially nicer.  This ""store and forward"" also happens on the WhatsApp chat servers. When a WhatsApp mobile app connects to the chat servers, the store-and-forward process occurs in both directions. The client sends any pending messages in it's mesage store to the server, while the server sends all the accumulated messages destined for that client to the client.  This process is done on an acknowlegement basis. This means messages are sent repeatedly until the other side acknowledges receipt of the message.One difference between the server and the client for ""store and forward"" is that the server drops messages once they are acknowledged - there is no long term storage.  Whereas the client will update the UI to double-check status once the ack arrives, but will keep the message.  In the WhatsApp framework, the client is the canonical message store, and the server is a router with temporary storage. This is in contrast to the more typical ""store everything forever"" strategy seen by other large communication providers operating today.The lifecycle of a message from 'A' to 'B' is thus:user A sends a message by hitting 'send' button.A's client code connects to the chat serverA's client sends the message body to the chat serverthe chat server sends an 'ack' back to the client code so that the message isn't sent again in the future.  This puts the message in 'single check' in the UINow the message is owned by the server. If we are lucky, client B is already online, and the message can be pushed down the existing connection B has established.  If client 'B' is not currently online, then the server has a decision tree of actions to take to try to get B to connect. Typically a push notification is delivered to client B.  Some platforms will just display that notification directly to the user, and wait for user action to start the app. Others allow the push notification to be delivered directly to the WhatsApp application, in the background.  Background delivery is again, a much nicer experience for the user, as WhatsApp can then setup a chat connection in the background, fetch the messages, then notify the user.  This means the user won't have to wait for message delivery when they open the application, as the messages are already inserted into the message database.No matter how B's client code is activated, once it connects to the server and receives A's message, it sends back an 'ack' to the server. This relieves the server from the duty of delivering that message in the future.  This 'ack' is routed all the way back to A's client, and the message is then in 'double check' in the UI for A, indicating that the delivery process is complete.That's how WhatsApp messages are delivered.This does not explain other details, like:How media content is delivered - it's a different mechanism than chat messages.How profile pictures for group chats and individual chats are distributed to other clientsHow status messages are set and distributed to other clientsHow the address book information is synced from the client to the serverHow 'online' 'last seen' and 'is typing..' are signaled from one client to another.Group chat functionality."

1070,"Neuroscience, like most sciences, are geared heavily towards research, with a leaning towards academic research. This is an inherent part of academic study - you learn, in the most part, from and with academics, who have experience in academia. Some programmes at some universities are geared for industry, but they are rare, especially in a field such as neuroscience.So the most obvious field is academia. I don't know what stage you are at, but for this you'll need to go the whole hog - a PhD (and maybe an MA first), and probably a post-doc or two (or four). Work on publishing, publish as much as you can, in the best journals you can - quality and quantity are both important. Try and do collaborations, especially with bigger names, and especially projects where you are likely to be first author on at least some of the papers. During the post-docs you start looking for positions at universities and colleges.If academia doesn't interest you, then there are various industry options out there. For these, the more other skills you bring to the table the better. The most obvious two for industry are data analysis and machine learning/computational modelling. There is research being done in industry, but it tends to be aimed in very different directions from academic research—rather than “how does this work?”, it’s more “how can this be utilised?”The other direction is the clinical - neuropsychiatry, neurosurgery, neurodevelopment, treating atypical neurology. For this, you’ll need a background in medicine as well.As for the sub-fields, there are so, so many, it would impossible to write them all. I do neuroscience by utilising neuroimaging techniques as a tool to ask questions about how language works. But there is an entire world, from working on the neurochemistry of individual neurons and synaptic connections, through modelling of networks in the brain and all the way up to functional neuroimaging, and that’s without going into modelling of neural processes at different levels, the philosophy of neuroscience and much, much more."

Google is full of idiots posting nonsense information.Salary of an MBBS graduate in India is minimum rs 7 L per annum means 58k per month even when the doctor works under state government in rural area i.e. PHC. In Delhi Government hospitals give 97000 salary to an MBBS graduate. In metro city like Mumbai the corporation hospitals give 68k per month salary to fresher MBBS after finishing internship (As per 7th pay now).But mind you BHMS , BAMS are the one who works for as low as 8-10 k per month.No other field in India give 7 Lakh per annum salary to a fresher.When an MBBS doctor start to do general practice they earn minimum 4k to 5 k per day easily & that makes 1.20 to1.5 L per month means 12 to 18 L per annum.After doing post graduation & starting own hospital in small towns or tier 1 or tier 2 cities they can earn even more big money.Just go to any gynaecologist's hospital in India & see how much they charge for a Normal delivery & cesarean delivery. Any normal delivery now costs upto 20 k & cesarean up to 40 k in small towns & in metros for cesarean upto 1 L per delivery. Per day any average settled doctor do at least 1 cesarean & 2-3 normal deliveries minimum in small towns. So it gives at least 50 K per day means 15 L per month. Similarly rheumatologists, orthopedics drs , cardiologists earn upto 1 L per day when they start own practice. Chances of earning more money is after establishing own private practice and not in government job for doctorsStill then No other degree in India will give such an handsome salary like mbbs & a job security just after MBBS for an average medico who has not so good academic record.Getting a PG seat is tough but even at MBBS level doctors are better than jobless engineers in India.Many engineers are now going for civil services because of unemployment & hectic work schedule , traveling through heavy traffic in cities like pune , Mumbai , harassment by boss in corporate sector.Every 2nd & 3rd teenager in India is now going for engineering. Their production is so much & demand is not like that. Getting an admission in Government medical college in India for MBBS is not a joke.

1074,"Apple shape or inverted triangle shape.You should consider both reducing your upper body and developing your lower body. As apple shaped body type tends more to store muscle or fat in upper body, lower body needs to be worked out to develop. Some of the lower body workouts include running, cycling,and jumping rope. For toning particular muscle groups like calf and thigh, you need to perform few workouts.Cardio seems to be best exercise to lose overall body fat and belly fat as well, to reduce your upper body a bit. Hit cardio three to four times a week, High Intensity Interval Training is more effective.Take a proper diet to maintain muscle and lose fat. Favor complex carbohydrates: Make half of your diet with these complex carbohydrates like Brown Rice, Multi Grain Breads, oat meal, and most fruits(avoid very sweet fruits like bananas).Eat Proteins: As you are going to workout, you need to take enough protein in your diet. You can have chicken, fish, Egg-whites etc. Your body needs 0.8 grams of protein per kilogram of body weight.Stay away from sweets and refined carbohydrates.Exercises for building leg muscles:(Twice a week)Squats are the most common exercise for building the quadriceps and other large thigh muscles. But squats must be done carefully to avoid knee injury. The basic squat involves holding a barbell on your shoulders behind your neck and lowering your torso a few inches by bending your legs. Never go all the way down — that puts far too much strain on the knees.Squats can be done without weights simply by standing with your back against the wall. Just lower yourself a few inches by bending your legs and stand up again. Never go all the way down into a crouch.A safer way to do squats is with a squat machine that requires you to sit or lie with your feet against a platform connected to a stack of weights. When you push against the platform, you lift the weight. Never extend your legs so far that your knees lock because that could cause injury. Repeat this exercise 8 to 12 times, until your legs feel fatigued. When you can do more than 12 repetitions, increase the weight.A thigh machine builds your thigh muscles by having you sit with your knees bent, feet locked behind a bar attached to a stack of weights. When you pull forward with your calves, the motion works all your thigh muscles. A similar machine exercises your hamstring muscles, on the back of your thighs. Lie stomach down on the bench and hook your heels under a bar. When you bend your legs and pull the bar upwards, you exercise the back of your legs.The leg lunge is a safe and effective method of working the legs. Hold a dumbbell in each hand with your palms facing toward your body. Step forward with your arms at your sides, parallel to your body, and bend the knee of the forward leg, forcing it to bear the weight of your body. Return to your starting position and repeat with the other leg. Do this 8 to12 times with each leg.To build your calf muscles, lift a barbell and hold it against your thighs, or hold a dumbbell in each hand with your arms hanging straight down at your sides. Lift your heels off the floor 8 to 12 times. Increase the weight of the barbell or dumbbell as you get stronger.Suffer the pain of Discipline or Suffer the pain of Regret. Workout everyday :) All the best (y)"

1076,"Depends. Are you talking about student jobs or jobs post graduation? It might help to clarify on this.There are a few key things you will have to consider as an international student:Find out on the country’s immigration website if it allows students to work while on a study visa. Majority of English speaking countries allows a 20hr per week work allowance on study visasIs there an option to apply for a post study work visa after graduation? I think the UK no longer issues post graduate work visas, Australia does and I think the US and Canada as well. Be sure to do your research before lodging your application as immigration rules changes like the weather.I would be careful in recommending any country at this stage because none will qualify as the “easiest” to find jobs. Jobs are not handouts you know. They require passing an interview and having certain skills.Good Luck"

All the information we have on active terrorists, their financiers and planning? All the specifications of our weapons and weapons in development?The damage you would have inflicted on America's security and intelligence apparatus is incalculable. Assuming you're an American, you would be seen as the single greatest traitor in the history of the United States, and the government would go to extraordinary lengths to find you. I doubt you'd even find sanctuary in another country, as the U.S. would probably make it very clear that any country that harboured you would be seen as being complicit in the affair, and there would be reciprocity. If you were a non-American, I'm confident you'd still be actively hunted - if not just by America, by any and all of its allies whose defense information you also compromised (ie, most of them).I don't know what you would have intended to reveal to the public in all of this. Whatever you confirmed about the extent of the government's domestic surveillance programs would be lost in outrage at the total compromise of national security. Moreover, if the assumption here is that the NSA has meticulously collected and stored the most personal details of Americans and their frequent contacts, you've just dumped all that information for everyone to see - likely to include details about the lives of the hackers whose praise you were seeking. I doubt you'd win a lot of fans for doing that. Sure, there'd be many who would hail you as a ""hero"" of some kind for sticking it to the government, but I think it'd be safe to say that most Americans would default to ""enemy of the state"" and take some satisfaction in watching you get run to ground. As for the ""hacker circle,"" I'm sure many would be impressed with your ability to break through multiple secure systems. I'm also sure many would thank you for giving them employment opportunities to help the government repair the damage you've caused to its security protocols. I'm also sure many would also recognize the act of treason you'd committed - if not also be pissed about your very likely having made their personal information public, per above - and also find employment with the government in aiding with your capture."

1080,"If you made every person in the US (all 325 million) try to do their max number of consecutive pullups without letting go of the bar, and wrote it down in a list , I think the total number of pullups done would be around 100 million.That’s an average of about 0.3 pullups per person. In terms of the distribution, I would guess that more than half of americans could not do a single strict pullup.That’s because the population I’m referring to includes infants and children as well as elderly folks. Those populations would have an average of zero. In male teenagers and adults, I assume that you would average about 1 pullup (i.e. if you picked 400 random males of this age range off the street you’d get about 400 pullups total out of them). Many males in this age range would also do zero. For females, I assumed you’d have about 90+% who cannot do pullups.So if you are talking about the average (i.e. median person), the answer is probably zero."
1081,"If you don’t understand how Trump could win before Nov. 8th, I totally understand you.If you still don’t understand how Trump won now, you have a serious arrogance and ignorance problem.I would assume you, the reader to this answer, live in a urban area in either Northeast or the West Coast, college educated, a typical left-wing supporter and advocator for your entire life.That’s nice. You work in the office with HVAC on 24/7/365. You go to gym after work, watching news from CNN or NBC on the treadmill. Then you eat your dinner out somewhere with a friend, probably not cooking at home. Sometimes you fly between NYC/Boston and LA/SFO for business. When you look down from the plane window and see those endless farmlands and mountains in the midwest, you are thinking “I can’t imagine living a life down there.”When you saw Trump won, you were shocked. Holy shit! There’s not a single person around me who supports Trump, how could he win?That’s where the problem is. You are living in a completely different world than those Trump supporters.When you refuel your car, have you ever wondered where the gas comes from, if not imported? Who drilled the oil for you?When you charge your phone, have you ever wondered where the electricity comes from? Who dug the coal to power the plant?When you shop in the supermarket, have you ever wondered where the fresh vegetables and fruits come from? Who drove the truck all the way from California to New York to deliver those goods?Those are the people who support Donald Trump. Have you ever talked to any one of them?Without you, they can still feed themselves, but without them, you will be starved to death. You don’t know how to grow crops, and you dare not to kill a chicken.So now how could you despise them as “uneducated redneck racists”?When they watch the news, even when watching Fox News, the camera is always on the big cities far away from them. They are ignored, as if they don’t exist in this country. No one pays attention to them, and no one speaks for them, until Donald Trump.They could drive a truck for $8k a month 20 years ago working 60 hours a week, but now the illegal immigrants are willing to do it at $3k. They lost their jobs.They could work in a factory for $4k a month 20 years ago, but now the job goes to China and Mexico when the workers there make $500 a month. They lost their jobs.You can’t urge a 40-year-old man with a high school diploma having a family to raise to go to college again and learn programming or investment banking. He can’t and he can’t afford.You also can’t say in 10 years robots are doing the job for them and they should just vanish because their minds and skills don’t follow the era.They are human beings. They are also lovely nice people. They don’t hate you. They work hard so you can live a comfortable life. Why do you hate them? Why do you label them as racist deplorables and xenophobic bigots without even knowing how hard their lives are?When they are losing jobs and falling into poverty, they don’t know what to do. They stay at home and turn on the TV and see Obama and Hillary speaking on ABC News: “The biggest problem our society now facing is climate change.”They may voted for Obama 8 years ago and hoped him to bring change to their life, but they could only sigh when they see this. So they switch to Fox News and see Donald Trump speaking on his rally in Detroit, MI: “We need to rebuild our inner cities, we need to bring jobs back.” They follow him and say: “YES! Let’s make America great again!”When they saw Obama visiting NYC after hurricane Sandy in 2012, but was playing golf when the devastating flood in Louisiana destroyed thousands of homes this summer, they knew they were forgotten.However, when they saw Trump visiting Louisiana after the flood, a state that he didn’t need to campaign at all, they knew someone actually cared for them.If you are them, who will you vote for?They are the silent majorities. They live in your flyover states. They don’t care about LGBT or BLM. They are not racist or homophobic. They just want jobs to feed their families.Please throw away your arrogance and start to care about those people. They are Americans too. They might be more American than you are, since many of your clients and customers are foreign.They have no methods to let you hear them. All the medias don’t speak for them, all the celebrities don’t pay attention to them. All the career politicians don’t represent them. The only weapon they have are their ballots. They vote to knock you out of your utopia. That’s the power of democracy. That’s why democracy is great. It never ignores anyone.If you believe your value is progressive and right, you need to help them getting out of their trouble first. You can’t blame and mock them. It will only push them away from you even more.Trump has been a democrat longer than republican in his life. He has married 3 times, agrees with progressive income tax, has been pro-choice in most of his life and pro-LGBT all the time. The only hardcore conservative thing I can think of him is anti-alcohol. However, he could still defeat 16 truly conservative republican candidates and won more votes in the primaries than anyone else in the history. This has already proven that the silent majorities are much more tolerant now on social issues. They just want someone to fix the economy for them.Now it’s your chance to work with them, help them under the 4 years of Trump’s presidency. Stop protesting and introspect yourself. Isn’t your arrogance and ignorance that brought Trump to the White House?"
1082,"DefinitelyWith the development of social media like Facebook people love to show off even the most minor things they do and in a funny sort of way it becomes like a competition. For instance, i know of two friends(well ex-friends) and how if one person puts up a picture of their dinner one day the other one would put a picture of their dinner an hour or so later and it was quite interesting to see their little tussle which in the end is quite immature.Well why do they do it?Insecurity: they need constant reassurance from people that the clothes they wear or the food that they cook is fantastic and a lot of people who seek attention need this constant praise for whatever they do“Thou art better than you”: With facebook show offs everything to them is a competition and this is a case of superiority complex. Think about the annoying couple, parent or kid when it comes to their SO/ kids/parents birthday posting a long post about “lucky and blessed” they are to be around this person. I mean yes they are special to you but the long posts basically describe what a normal spouse/child/parent should do so whats the point of projecting a normal thing to a hyped up level? It’s to basically show to other people how their life is better and how everything in their life is a notch about everyone else when in reality things could be a lot more different(its all about projecting to friends)To create an image of someone who they aren’t: This is more of a peer pressure thing. I know of many people who project themselves on the basis of major trends and fads going around for instance an aunty I know likes to spend her time drinking and partying away and having quite a lavish lifestyle. However, when it comes to a religious festival or a function they would dress up and put up pictures of them praying to god and showing how orthodox they are while comments from her mob would read “omg soo religious” or “may god bless you for your devotion”(yeah right). So i feel they kinda of trick themselves into being someone else that doesn’t tie in with their personality and succumb to trends and fads."
1083,"The day you start your period is CD (cycle day) 1. On a 28 day cycle, ovulation will occur on CD 14. Your luteal phase will be 14 days after ovulation and ending on CD 28. If you have a 27 days cycle, ovulation will happen on CD 13. I happened to ovulate on CD 11 this month, early, so I will have a 24 day cycle.After ovulation the egg only has about 24 hours to be fertilized. The most fertile time for a woman is within 5 days before ovulation and the day of. Sperm can life up to 5 days inside of the uterus waiting for an egg to fertilize. IF the egg is fertilized by one sperm, it only takes one sperm to achieve fertilization, then the egg takes 4–5 days to travel down the fallopian tube. It enters the uterus and starts to implant if all conditions are good. Implantation can occur between 6–12 days after ovulation. Between CD 20–CD 26.So to answer your question. If you ovulated on CD 14 and you had unprotected sex prior to that within 5 days, then the egg can be fertilized by CD 18 and waiting to implant. Pregnancy is not considered a pregnancy unless the egg implants because many times a fertilized egg will not implant and pregnancy do not occur. You should track when you ovulate by using OPK (ovulation predictor kit) but remember you ovulate 1-2 days AFTER your opk is positive. So if you happen to ovulate earlier in the cycle, like I do about every 6 months, there is a possibility of being pregnant on CD 18, but it would be way too early to even tell if you are pregnant because HCG (the pregnancy hormone) is not high enough to detect until a few days after implantation. Sometimes over a week or longer for levels to be high enough to detect on a HPT. If you have tested positive on CD 18 then most likely you are pregnant from last cycle and possibly mistaken implantation bleeding, only very few women even experience implantation bleeding, for your period. A lot of wemen do mistake. I hope this helps…"
1084,"If you know C, you already know half of Java and if you know C++, you already know the rest half of Java. Basically C++ is more complicated programming language than Java and you will have to unlearn a few things when transitioning from C++ to Java. Here are a few examples:When you allocate memory for a new object, don't worry about deleting it. GC is there to help you in Java. When the object is not strongly reachable, it will be collected.When you pass objects in Java, they are always passed via references (unlike C++ where they get copied based on copy constructor, unless you are specifically returning/passing a reference using &). So it is the same object in Java and not a copy and if you change it, the master object is being changed (unless you manually clone it and pass the clone instead).In C++, an exception should always be passed as a reference, otherwise it will be copied using a copy constructor. In Java, it is always a reference as pointed out in 2.Java classes can inherit from only a single class, whereas C++ allows a class to inherit from multiple classes.There is no virtual keyword in Java. So that means everything is implicitly virtual. So no more memory leaks just because your destructor was not declared virtual.There are a few other points too, but I guess the above gives you an idea of what I meant by unlearning stuff from C++ when you transition into Java."
1085,"The condition in which a man has fewer than 15 million sperm per milliliter of semen is called oligozoospermia or low sperm count. Usage of drugs, excessive alcohol use, smoking, stress, and excess body weight can cause low sperm count.Low Sperm CountOne of the primary causes of infertility is ayurvedic medicine for low sperm count and motility. That, coupled with poor sperm quality, represents 90 percent of all cases of infertility in men and anywhere from 20 t0 40 percent in couples.It is a frustrating and often disheartening condition that affects nearly one in six men. Causes range from hereditary factors and lifestyle choices to past infection and age.Characteristics of Low Sperm Count and MotilityOligoasthenoteratozoospermia (OAT) is the term we used to describe this condition. By definition, OAT is characterized by semen with the following qualities:An abnormally low amount of sperm (oligozoospermia)An abnormally low amount of sperm with good motility (asthenozoospermia)An abnormally low level of sperm of a healthy shape (teratozoospermia)The term oligoasthenoteratozoospermia is used when all three factors are present.Idiopathic oligoasthenoteratozoospermia is used when the cause of the condition is unclear. Up to 30 percent of male infertility cases are said to have idiopathic OAT.Causes and Treatment of OATThe factors for OAT can be broadly broken down into four categories: genetic factors, lifestyle factors, and testicular factors, and testicular/ejaculatory dysfunction.Genetic factors can affect every stage of male fertility, ranging from DNA damage in sperm cells (spermatozoa), genetic defects of the Y chromosome, and genetic disorders like Klinefelter syndrome. Most of the factors are not treatable per se but can often be overcome with the use of in vitro fertilization (IVF).Lifestyle factors involve both habits and conditions that directly affect the man's sperm. Many of these factors are changeable and can significantly improve a man's chance of conceiving. Among them:Smoking is strongly linked to male infertility although the reasons are not entirely clear. What we do know is that smoking can reduce the sperm count by 23 percent and sperm motility be 13 percent.Alcohol consumption of a little as five drinks per week can significantly lower a man's testosterone and the quality of his sperm. Many recreational drugs have the same effect.Obesity (BMI over 30) is known to cause hormonal changes that can directly impact a man's fertility. Being seriously underweight (BMI under 18.5) is also a concern.Strenuous riding (cycling, horseback) can cause testicular inflammation which can be relieved by simply taking a break from the activity.Overheating the testes is associated with low sperm count. Causes include too hot showers baths, or sauna, as well as wearing tight briefs instead of boxers. Overexertion at the gym can also have the same effect.Certain medications can also affect the quality of sperm (anabolic steroids, Tagamet used to treat stomach acid) while other cans affect sperm motility (Azulfidine used to treat rheumatoid arthritis and Macrobid used to treat bladder infections)."
1086,"At the age of 17, I travelled to India with my family and quickly learned that this country was one of the most unique places on the floating rock we call home.That's earth by the way.. if you couldn't figure it out. Moving on!So why? Why is India so unique and different from a lot of other countries. Well, today that's going to be my job, to tell you why I think India stands out from other places I've travelled to.1. Language.Did you know this fascinating country has 22 official languages? Yeah, I'm not kidding you! The main languages are of course Hindi and English, so for western tourists and travellers, India is the perfect destination if you don't want the stress of trying to tell the guy behind the counter you don't want milk in your tea.Let's face it. There is nothing worse than standing there laughing to hide your embarrassment while the bartender stares blankly at you trying to figure out why this stupid tourist even left their hotel room to try and be adventures by mingling with the locals.2. Eating with your hands.Where countries in the western world use everyday utensils such as spoons, forks and knives, Indians use their hands (preferably the right hand) to eat their daily meals. I found the idea of picking up food with my hand strange at first, this was mainly because I've been told since day one by my Mother, that you shouldn't play with your food and to 'use your knife and fork"". However, after a few days, my family and I got used to eating with our hands, and I found it to be more convenient than having to use a knife and fork.My Mum liked it a lot for some reason... ironic right?A lot of people don't realise that eating with your hands is actually a lot cleaner than using metal or plastic utensils. At least you know where your hands have been, just remember to wash them.... please.3. Respect for family members.The Indian culture greatly revolves around one's family members. Unlike a lot of western countries, it would not be seen as ""uncool"" to live with your family members. I think this is a beautiful concept, and other countries should take a leaf out of India's book by embracing the idea that spending time with and caring for your family is normal and not something that is considered weird.But we can still say ""Mum get out of my room!"" right?4. Beautiful and vibrant clothes.Indian fashion is abundant with colour and beautiful styles. This makes walking down an ordinary street in India feel like you have stepped into a fairy tale filled with magic and wonder. I think the Indian sense of style is unmatched and once again, my Mother loved the saris worn by the Indian women.Whilst in India, I made a video that shows just how beautiful the colours of India are, check it out!5. Hospitality.I found that Indian people are incredibly welcoming and will do all in their power to make you feel at home and comfortable. This is the case when you go to a restaurant, hotel, a shop and even a yoga class. They have a kind nature and are respectful people. If you ever had any thoughts of being treated wrong in India, then I advise you to forget them and pack your bag today.Go to India. See why this country is unique and so special. You will truly love it I promise you.Anyway, that's all from me! I hope you enjoyed reading and have a fantastic rest of your day.Thank you!!-Sonny"

1089,"★★★★★I reached out to the MBA Crystal Ball team to understand my position as an Indian applicant. Here are my thoughts on their services: 1. MAP process - The MBA MAP process is meticulously prepared and pushes candidates to think honestly to get the best out of the whole process. 2. MAP interview and follow up discussion - The discussions were very open without any sugar coating and ego-massaging aspects. Like most folks, I started these processes with the aim to know my 'chances' at my target schools. However the team slowly guided me to think more holistically that is what are my *real* post MBA goals and how my choices of schools stands in relation to it. To highlight one crucial aspect, I started the process with a rigid goal without thinking through few aspects such as the overall cost of an MBA and how long it would take me to payback my debts and so on. Coming out of this process, my goals have a lot more meaning w.r.t to my background, target schools and I feel super-confident as an applicant to position myself to the admissions team and recruiters. Not only that, I felt MBA crystal ball team conveyed the real message without imposing any time constraint on either the initial or final wrap up call. I don't think anyone else will provide such high quality service and be willing to answer all the questions that I had researched. To add some more context, I had also utilized a one-school comprehensive package from a admission consulting firm in US (and payed more than a month's US salary) and feel the value that I got out of the MBA MAP was way more. I guess the MBA Crystal ball team understand and appreciate the Indian applicant's position much more than any American consulting firm can ever do. I will recommend MBA Crystal ball MAP service to anyone who wants to understand their position and not just chances w.r.t to some randomly picked schools. Real take away: Start early, know your position and how you come across to the admissions team, talk to the MBA MAP team with an open mind (your see-me-save-the-world goal will be torn apart if it doesn't have strong legs) and build your overall position."

1091,"I suggest that there is one overarching issue that makes the decision easy for me: the Supreme Court.Trump is likely to appoint justices who will overturn Roe v Wade. If you are someone who likes the law recently enacted by Oklahoma to criminalize any doctor who performs an abortion without any exceptions, you should probably favor Trump. (Thankfully the Governor vetoed that law, but some version of it will probably get enacted.)Clinton is likely to appoint justices who respect women's reproductive rights.That's enough for me right there, but a few others worth mentioning:Trump denies global warming; Clinton accepts science.Trump has encouraged a return to the use of torture; Clinton doesn't.Trump has made certain suggestions that show a woeful misunderstanding of public debt. Donald Trump Can Pay Off the National Debt in 8 Years. Clinton and her advisors are competent in this area.And with regard to the claim that Clinton is evil, I suggest a second look, using unbiased sources who have investigated: This may shock you: Hillary Clinton is fundamentally honest | Jill Abramson"
1092,"I'm a guy in England and I go night clubbing with a friend every weekend, the main aim was to end up in bed with a woman. Sometimes we were successful but more often we went home alone back to our own beds.Then we met two girls and we went back to their flat. We all went into their bedroom and undressed and the two girls said they would put on a show for us and they started kissing each other. We sat on the other bed and watched and we were both rock hard. Then the girls moved on us and started sucking our cocks and then one of them suggested I suck my friends cock. I was not expecting this and the girls laughed at my reaction and one said they were only kidding, they were joking but, they were really being serious.They asked if we wanted to fuck them and we both said we do and then they said they wanted to see us 69 each other first before that would happen.My friend said to me let's do it and he started sucking me, I looked at the girls and imagined it was another girl sucking me. We got on the bed and I was staring at his fairly thick cock and one of the girls pushed my head on to it and I opened my mouth and in it went. I was surprised at how smooth the head was and it filled my mouth. Soon we were sucking each other off and the girls were loving itThey were 69ing on the other bed for a while then we paired up and 69ed the girls each. We swopped round for a bit and we fucked but the girls made us fuck them in the same position starting with mish and then under and finally doggy. My friend came first and when he finished my girl stopped me and told me to clean her friend out. I was shocked, another first for me and then I was led to the other bed, I lay on my back then and I had my face squashed with sopping wet cunt and my mates sperm oozing out down my throat. Ooh how the girls laughed at me but my cock was hard and I wanted to cum and I was told to fuck my mates girl. I put my cock in her cunt doggy style which was still dripping with his sperm and my mate was told to lie underneath her and lick her clit while I fucked her. I was telling her I was ready to cum and she stopped me, not yet, it's too soon, my mate had to lick her some more and I kneeled keeping still and and then slowly inside her and then she told me to start thrusting again. Then I felt her cunt get all warm and my mate started moaning loud and calling her a bitch and I realised she was squirting in his face, that made me start cumming as the girls were laughing like mad and then my mate was eating my sperm out of her cunt mixed with her squirt!The next week we went out and we saw the girls again this time they were chatting away with two guys and we knew what they were in for…When the evening ended, we were once again on our own, no sexy girls this time and my mate said to me, do you fancy going back to my place? I asked what for and he just said, well seeing as we didn't score we could always just 69 each other?A couple of years have passed now we are both married and our wive's are good friends and definitely not interested in each other sexually. We still suck each others cocks when we get the chance but I have not felt the need to suck any other guys cock, I don't consider myself gay or bi and he does not either. For me there is just something about his cock, it's a perfect size, about 5″ and looks like a porn cock and I do enjoy sucking it more than having mine sucked.I love it when he says ‘I'm cumming’ and I slow down and wait for that feeling, that realisation that suddenly you have a mouth full of warm, sticky and slightly strange sweet tasting sperm.Ever since that time with those girls I now always swallow his sperm and I always swallow my own too. I always lick my wife clean in that same position that I did for the first time that night with those wonderful girls."
1093,"As far as I understand, Dubai police has a communication problem.  There is a Special tourism department (directorate ..) police dedicated to protect the tourist and to deal with them in English, but rare are those that know about it.The head of the Police being motorheads, have this wonderful idea that tourist will want to interact with police officers in rare and beautiful car. I am not sure it is working the way they intended to, but it got a lot of mostly positive attention, therefore the plan is still in motion.Just to understand the reasoning behind this plan, I am going to tell you an anecdote that illustrate the relationship between the Emirati and their cars.  Ou neighbour, an Emirati, had a Mercedes Mclaren SLR. Once he caught my daughter (6 at the time) gawking at his car (the doors open vertically). He kindly invited to seat in the  driver seat, we took picture and thanked him profusely. He and his wife started talk to us whenever we met  from that time on."
1094,"While the picture below is very telling, it is sometimes not all that obvious. Not very long ago I purchased a female cavy from the local feed store. She did not even look plump, which might have given me a hint. Less than two weeks later I woke up, passed by her cage and thought I saw another living thing in the cage. Thinking I must be seeing things I went back and there was a baby guinea pig running around the cage, apparently during the night! Both did well. The sow had been very young when I bought her but she had been in a group cage. So just be aware!"

1096,"""Very, very slim"" to ""almost negligible"" if you're talking about investing into one company, increasing to ""slim"" if the syndicate invests into a dozen or more companies.I know I'm going to draw the ire of some of the angel crowd, most of the entrepreneurial crowd and all of the crowdfunding crowd with this response, so it's important to back it up with an explanation, namely:A majority of all new, angel-backed companies fail completely, so if you invest in only one company, the odds are that you will LOSE ALL YOUR MONEY, not just ""not make a profit"".Several studies and mathematical simulations have shown that it takes investing the same amount of money consistently into at least 20-25 companies before your returns begin to approach the typical return of over 20% for professional, active angel investing. This means the greater the number of companies into which the angel syndicate invests, the greater the likelihood of an overall positive return. [1]However...Angel investing (like venture capital) follows the classic J-curve. Because unsuccessful companies tend to fail early, and big exits from the successful ones tend to take a long time to develop, when you graph it on a timeline, the overall value of an angel portfolio makes a shape like the letter ""J"".  The value immediately begins dropping for several years as soon as you start investing, and only after a fair amount of time does it change direction and begin to be worth more than the original investment. [2]Since the average holding period for an angel investment in the United States is NINE YEARS, after only five years it is quite likely that the value of the syndicate's portfolio will still be underwater, unless it just happened to include one unusual, Black Swan, quick home run.But...A significant part of angel investing is getting access to good deal flow in the first place. The average investment PER ANGEL / PER COMPANY from an angel member of a serious angel group is about $25,000. If you're only investing $5,000 into the syndicate, and especially if you expect that to cover participation in several deals, the reality is that you would not be considered a significant investor either by potential investees, or even by your fellow investors. And a syndicate made up of even a hundred $5K investors would likely not have the resources to be taken seriously by the 'best' companies, thereby relegating it to starting with a second-tier caliber of deal flow.And finally...Companies always need more money, and therefore provide incentives for their investors to step up and participate in follow-on rounds. These incentives invariably come at the expense of the early investors who choose NOT to participate...which is why venture capitalists always reserve the same amount as their initial investment for them to put in later into the same company. Unless you (or the syndicate) are planning to reserve for follow-ons, your interest is likely to be significantly reduced over time.I realize that this all sounds very depressing, and makes one wonder why on earth anyone would ever become an angel (good question, actually!)  But the answer to that lies precisely in all of the cautions above:IF you are an Accredited Investor, andIF you are prepared to invest at least $50K to $100K per year, andIF you make sure to reserve quite a bit for follow-on financings, andIF you develop a strong deal flow of good companies, either through an angel group or your own contacts, andIF you invest consistently so that you have at least 20 companies (ideally more) in your portfolio, andIF you are professional in both your due diligence investigation and your deal term negotiation (including specifically with regard to valuations), andIF you go in with the knowledge that you are going to be in it for at least a decade, holding completely illiquid assets, andIF you can help add value ..."
1097,"Stem cells are undifferentiated cells that are not specialised for any particular function. Totipotent stem cells (e.g. the zygote formed directly after fertilisation) have the potential to differentiate into any cell type (embryonic tissue and extraembryonic tissue/all the cells of the embryo and the placenta) thus have the potential to form a complete organism. All the epigenetic modifications to the cell (e.g. DNA methylation) have been removed in the post fertilisation zygote (except at certain imprinted regions, e.g. on chromosomes 11, 7, 17, 15, and 12 that influence foetal growth, and at IAP retrotransposons which provides a mechanism for transgenerational inheritance) allowing the cell to roll down one of numerous differentiation pathways. Pluripotent stem cells (e.g. the cells of the ICM of the blastocyst that are differentiating in embryogenesis) have the potential to differentiate into all the 216 different cell types of the human body (all the required embryonic tissue) but cannot develop into extraembryonic tissue to facilitate foetal growth. Multipotent stem cells found in an adult (e.g. in the bone marrow) have the potential to differentiate into a few cell types (e.g. white blood cells, red blood cells, and platelets).Differentiated cells are those that have been subject to specific epigenetic modifications to the cell (e.g. in embryogenesis) in response to developmental cues or environmental signals/stimuli. Specific epigenetic modifications (e.g. DNA methylation at a CpG motif or histone acetylation) can cause certain genes to be switched on and expressed, and certain genes to be switched off. Specific genes will be switched on (depending on the cues/signals the cell receives) therefore specific strands of mRNA will be produced in transcription (as the transcription initiation complex including RNA polymerase is able to bing to a certain motif at the promoter region upstream of a certain gene that isn't methylated) and specific proteins are produced in translation that have a particular structure and therefore function and therefore affect the structure and function of the cell, causing it to become specialised.The specific mechanism for switching genes on or off is as follows:Cells are exposed to a stimulus (e.g. a chemical) that induces epigenetic modifications within the cell. Steroid hormone-receptor complexes can act as transcription factors (alternatively transcription factors can be activated by an intracellular second messenger molecule which is activated by a peptide hormone-receptor complex) which can bind to the promoter region of a gene at a certain motif and attract other enzymes (including RNA polymerase) which form the transcription initiation complex, which switches the gene on. Epigenetic modifications (due to developmental cues) such as histone acetylation or histone demethylation (via phf8) can also switch a gene on.Therefore, certain genes are switched on in development and expressed as certain proteins are produced (via a specific strand of mrna being transcribed and translated) which have a particular structure and affect the structure and therefore function of the cell, causing it to become specialised (it differentiates).Certain genes are also switched off as cells develop due to developmental cues and/or a stimulus (e.g a protein passed to the zygote from the egg cytoplasm) resulting in a complex of enzymes (including epigenetic ones) building up at the promoter region upstream of a certain gene, switching it off via DNA methylation (via DNMT + mecp2) or histone methylation (via MLL2/trim28 + mecp2) which drives down gene expression and prevents certain genes from being expressed.This means that a developing cell will express a unique combination of genes, causing it to differentiate and become specialised."
1098,"Alexandre is partially correct, and I assume you're referring to multiple root domains, not subdomains. To take it further, look at it in terms of concentration and end-user aims. A second site is good when you're running a special campaign (ex: Left vs Right Twix on a site other than Twix.com or ""Who Shot JR?"" on a site other than cbs.com ) or something that needs to be distanced from your core business agenda. However when the dust settles, your second site will retain the equity built from that campaign and the primary money-maker won't receive equity 1:1 back. If you're dealing with different products in the same ballpark, subfolder it. If you're dealing with different topics completely, consider subdomains. To build new websites altogether solely for cross-linking purposes is a waste of time, energy and dilution of link equity at its finest."
1099,"You stand a great chance with this CRS score to get ITA.Express Entry score for Invitation to Apply will go down. Pl. wait til 15 -Jan-2017Please do watch our this Video.Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC) has revamped the Comprehensive Ranking System (CRS) for its Express entryimmigration selection system. The changes will have a major effect on candidates for immigration to Canada through the three federal programs managed through Express Entry .The new instructions on Express Entry come into force on November 19, 2016.1. Invitations to ApplyCandidates who receive an Invitation to Apply (ITA) for permanent residence will have additional time to submit a complete application to Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC). Whereas previously an ITA was valid for 60, candidates will now have 90 days to submit an application after they receive an ITA.2. Canadian study now a factorThe points that are to be assigned for a Canadian educational credential are the following:· 0 points, if the foreign national has a secondary school educational credential;· 15 points, if the foreign national has an eligible credential from a one-year or two-year post-secondary program; and· 30 points, if the foreign national has either:· an eligible credential from a post-secondary program of three years or more,· an eligible credential from a university-level program at the master’s level or at the level of an entry-to-practice professional degree for an occupation listed in the National Occupational Classification matrix at Skill Level A for which licensing by a provincial regulatory body is required, or· an eligible credential from a university-level program at the doctoral level.Points are only assigned for Canadian study experience if, for the purpose of obtaining the credential, the foreign national:· studied in Canada at a Canadian educational institution;· was enrolled in full-time study or training for at least eight months; and· was physically present in Canada for at least eight months.Before these changes, there were no additional points available for international students/graduates who had completed a study program in Canada. The changes reflect the government’s goal of providing simpler pathways to permanent residents to international students and graduates in Canada.3. The significant changes to job offers are:· A qualifying job offer is now worth 200 points if the offer is in an occupation contained in a Major Group 00 of the National Occupational Classification (senior managerial level position). These occupations are:· 0011 Legislators· 0012 Senior government managers and officials· 0013 Senior managers – financial, communications and other business services· 0014 Senior managers – health, education, social and community services and membership organizations· 0015 Senior managers – trade, broadcasting and other services not elsewhere classified.· 0016 Senior managers – construction, transportation, production and utilitiesA qualifying job offer is now worth 50 points if the offer is any other qualifying offer of arranged employment.Previously, qualifying job offers supported by a Labor market assessment (LMIA) were worth 600 points under the CRS. As of November 19, there will be new ways of being awarded either 50 or 200 points without the need to obtain a LMIA (though points will continue to be awarded to individuals with a new or existing LMIA). The new regulations also allow the following individuals to be awarded points for a qualifying job offer:4.The consequences for candidates in the poolOn November 19, IRCC may automatically implement these changes for profiles already in the Express Entry pool. In many cases, candidates may notice that the number of CRS points awarded to them has not gone up. However, candidates without a job offer in particular should note that their profile — even though it may state the same number of points as before — may become more competitive, particularly next to candidates with LMIA-based job offers who see their scores dropping by up to 550 points.The Express Entry pool is a competitive environment, where candidates’ profiles are ranked against each other and the highest-ranked candidates are in a stronger position to receive an ITA when a draw is made. As of November 19, the value of a job offer will go down from 600 points to either 200 or 50 points (depending on the position offered).IRCC’s report of 2015, released earlier this year, showed that of the 31,063 ITAs issued last year, 14,465 (46.6%) of those were issued to candidates who had a job offer supported by a LMIA. Consequently, the effect of the most recent changes to the CRS could significantly change the make-up of the pool and the rate of candidates with a job offer who go on to receive an ITA. Although candidates with a job offer will continue to be awarded a significant number of points (50 or 200, depending on the position), candidates without a job offer may see their chances of success improving.5. Provincial Nominee Programs (PNPs) nomination will be very important.It should be noted that candidates who obtain an enhanced nomination certificate through a Provincial Nominee Program (PNP) category will continue to be awarded 600 points. Additionally, candidates should note that IRCC’s recently-released plan for 2017 revealed that the government of Canada aims to welcome around 51,000 new immigrants through the PNPs next year, a seven percent increase on the target for 2016. All this indicates that PNP will be a very valuable factor. It also means that because of all above changes, the CRS scoreto get ITA(Invitation to Apply) willdefinitely drop below 450 points.That is a great news.I am a member of ICCRC (Immigration Consultants of Canada Regulatory Council) and my membership number is R422575 .Please visit our website Dreamvisas | Registered Migration Agents,Pune to know more about us."
1100,"Micro ATM in the Indian context is not an ATM at all.  Automated teller machines as we know them are cash dispensers. Micro ATMs are actually modified point of sales terminals (card swipe machine)through which a bank can remotely connect to the bank's core banking system using his debit card. It is a card swipe machine with a fingerprint scanner attached to it. These machines are typically used by business correspondents (agents who represent banks in rural areas) of banks to connect customers who are far away from branches. This is how a micro ATM issued by Fino (a business correspondent) looks like:In this case the human being (the business correspondent) acts as the cash cache for the ATM. He collects deposits and feeds in data and also pays out from his pocket and debits the account. Micro ATMs are expected to be viable where ATMs are not. ATMs need at least 80-100 transactions a day to be viable as they costs several lakh and have monthly operating expenses of close to  Rs 20,000 after taking into account rental, telecom charges, AMC costs, electricity expenses and security guard.  A micro ATM costs less than Rs 20,000. Also because it is portable it can be with a shopkeeper who doubles as a BC.  Since connectivity is through GSM, the BC can carry it and travel village to village at set times. The downside of a micro ATM is that it cannot provide `anytime' money. Either the shop will close down or the BC might not be in town at the time when the account holder requires funds. It is widely expected that payment banks will use micro ATMs to reach out to rural poor to bring down their cost of operations."
1101,"I would nominate the illustrious period that is known today as the “Chinese Golden Age”, to be one of the greatest periods of time for all Chinese people anywhere in the world.Though the Tang Empire (618–907 AD) compared to the other Chinese dynasties that came before and even after it, was certainly neither the most successful, nor the richest, largest, nor even the most famous, it was meanwhile however, the most internationalized, cosmopolitan, open-minded and therefore also the greatest period of Imperial China not only in my mind, but also in the popular opinion of many other individuals, regardless of whether they be ethnically Chinese or not.A Tang era artist’s portrait of a group of Imperial Courtesans:Because of this great period of cosmopolitanism, Chinese civilization reached its almighty zenith, enabling it to influence countries even as far away as Persia, Arabia and Japan. The Chinese Economy meanwhile became the wealthiest in the world, its cities the largest, all the while Tang society and culture became the ultimate envy of the entire civilized world.Thus, the Tang can be said to clearly be a very admirable period for the Chinese people, and it is my greatest pleasure as an “Overseas” Chinese of sinitic ancestry, to proudly present: the Golden Era of the Tang Dynasty, that forgotten period of time where China was the most powerful country in the entire world, as measured by most metrics, and as agreed upon by most historians, dominating the 7th and 8th Centuries AD.A map of Tang China at its mighty zenith in 669 AD under Emperor Gaozong, with a total land area of approximately 12.37 million km^2 (making it 29% larger than Modern China today), which was then subsequently greatly reduced in magnitude by millions of km^2 merely 50 years later (Source/Fact Checker: World History Maps & Timelines):STRONG WARNING: Because my answer is so long, I would highly recommend you read it one chapter at a time (there are 7), perhaps maybe one per day or hour.

1103,"I have had this experience occasionally when sick, with a high fever, or withdrawing from medication. I realized that I was awake, but could imagine very complex vivid experiences & felt as if they were really happening, like once I re-lived a period of several months over and over like ""Groundhog Day"", doing things different each time. I felt like I was in a video game, living out several movies, books, songs, comic books and other things. I imagined these things awake, but reacted and felt everything like they were real. I knew I was awake and yet dreaming.Dreaming while awake could most likely be achieved other ways, like drugs or meditation. Sleep deprivation can also cause you to take micro-naps suddenly and perhaps voluntarily or involuntarily. Or you may start to hallucinate and experience weird things. Once when I had gone without sleep I thought my computer would run without power because I unplugged the UPS, but the battery level didn't drop below like 85%. Maybe it was a hallucination or software glitch or bad hardware but I didn't let the UPS keep running unplugged to see if it failed. I just imagined that it was creating free energy until I got some sleep. (Maybe there are some spiritual forces that influence you more if you don't get enough sleep, as some Christians believe.)Another weird thing happened while sleep deprived. I was in a hospital ER & had an experience of trying to escape, fighting several guards and falling on my knees outside in a gravel court yard. They tied me down and my knees were unhurt. Later they never said anything about me trying to escape. They said I did something else that I had no memory of doing - punching a wall by some nurse's or doctor's head. Maybe they were just lying or maybe I was dreaming one thing and doing something else unconsciously in the real world. All I know for sure is that weird things can happen when you don't get sleep. Not everyone hallucinates, but most do from what I've read."
1104,"This is a good maths question - one of the kind to keep my brain occupied for an embarrassingly large amount of time.I’m going to ask a question that’s fundamental to giving an answer: in what geometry?Most answers are assuming Euclidean (normal, two dimensional plane) geometry - so 5. I won’t draw the same diagram that’s been repeated about 60 times now, just go and look at the other answers.However, Euclidean isn’t the only geometry, and the question doesn’t say to assume it.The question specifies how many regions can be drawn with two straight lines, so the crux of my question is this - what are we calling a straight line? In Euclidean Geometry, a straight line is one in which if you draw a line perpendicular to that line, at any point on said line, any other place you drew it with would end up with a line parallel to the first.That’s only true of Euclidean Geometry. There are other geometries, although the only two I know of are Hyperbolic and Elliptic - going to be lazy and just point out a wikipedia article for now to define what those are:Non-Euclidean geometry - WikipediaElliptic Geometry is probably the easiest to picture in your mind. The most obvious example is a projection of the surface of a sphere onto a two dimensional map, such as the Mercator projection. The usual world map is something which itself is fundamentally misunderstood:Compare Countries With This Simple ToolSo to come back to the original question, here’s an answer that get’s 6. Let’s assume we’re working in hyperbolic geometry (which is weird but valid and consistent as a geometrical system. This splits the shape drawn into six segments using two lines (which are straight in this geometry - Or they would be if I had the drawing skill better than that of a trained monkey).There are probably other answers that can get higher maximums - this was just one example using non-Euclidean geometry."

1106,"There is only one work brain can do at a time, especially when it comes to studies. You can either talk, or study. You can't do both. And, this determination to continue studying without giving in to talking ( any distraction ) is what we say concentration.And, when will you not give in to talking, but to the reading? When the necessity arises.You have an exam tomorrow, you turn your books upside down! ( but even then there wouldn't be complete concentration as your mind is busy with anxiety, we will come to that later )Have an incentiveYou must make deadlines to have a better focusing power. A target to reach, and an award to gain at the end will drive you to complete the task to certain extent. This technique works best with children, by luring them to complete their homework in exchange for a chocolate.But, we are past that stage and for us, we need a better motivation and that would be pride. Pride is a very good motivator when it comes to studies, and its positive usage will increase your concentration levels as you have something to prove ( could be to self, friends, family, girlfriend, anyone...)Have a clarityUnclear mind will hinder with your progress. You aren't sure if you can read the particular chapter. You aren't sure if you can complete it. You aren't sure if you can memorize it.Your unsure nature will dampen your enthusiasm and in return, your concentration fluctuates. You read a sentence, and that devil named what if is back. That put a break in your study journey, and it takes a whole before you can get rid of it.Know it, believe it. It is all in your mind. This is a real-life deadlock.I will read if I understand it. I will understand it only if I read it. Unless you break the chain, it will go on.---------------Now, you have an incentive and a clear mind without any prejudices.That won't do. You still need to work on few more things.SurroundingYour surroundings should be as per your convenience.Do you prefer reading on bed? Or mat? Or a chair?Do you refer the room with fan? Or without it? Or outside in nature?Do you prefer sitting in a calm and silent place? Or a chatty one?Do you prefer surrounding yourself with food-snacks? Water? Eatables?Do you prefer hard music while reading? Or soft music? Or no music at all?Do you prefer reading in a large reading rooms? Or in private?Do you prefer a combined study? Or a single preference?Your concentration will be to its maximum when you are in apt surrounding suiting your preferences and tastes.I am likely to have greater concentration reading on bed, with fan, a slightly chatty atmosphere with soft music, eatables around me in a private room and no group study.Yes, you can read in other conditions too, but build your concentration with the factors favorable to you, and then it becomes a bit easier to deal with unfavorable factors.So, pick yours today. Make efforts to achieve or recreate that surrounding around you.No expectationsDon't hold any expectations. Don't. A million times no. You aren't a robo, and yes, you will take more time than you planned.Don't be disappointed if you complete only one question in the time you allotted for 3 questions. It is not because you were lacking concentration, it is because you are reading it with your own abilities.Thinking is far more easy than doing, and we always hold a greater number when it comes to studying. It is absolutely normal. There is nothing wrong with your concentration power, or your reading skills. It is a trick played by our mind.The sooner you accept it, you won't be dragging down your normal concentration.----------------Those will help you get to the right state of mind, and maintain that concentration, but you should follow these methods to boost that concentration.Interval study techniqueDid you ever notice that you always tend to remember the first and the last of your study session?

I was on the cloud nine today.Today, I did something adventurous, like I took my bike and went for a road trip to lavasa.I was scared because it is something I never did before, it was raining, atmosphere was Foggy, and I was little nervous but I finally made it. My first solo trip was great experience!{now don't ask me who clicked this Pic, as I was struggling to take selfie one good human being saw me & clicked this}This Pic shows the satisfaction on my face! Dar ke aage Jeet Wali feeling!And the weather was something like this.Actually, yesterday only I came across the app called “Trell” and downloaded it, and there was a challenge for weekend that either share your experience of a solo trip or have one, as I didn't have any experience of it, I thought of trying it but was scared. Not actually ready to go for it but then my husband motivated me to take this challenge saying you will gain a confidence go and make it happen ;and I did it.So life for me today is cool…Foggy…and rainy…So I am on the cloud 9 and life is amazing!Stay blessed stay happy and be adventurous!"

1109,"Thanks for the A2A!Something always gets lost in translation.It just isn’t exactly the same if you have to depend on a translator. When you are able to speak with someone in their own language, you realize that this is their true personality. There are tiny details and subtle nuances that you miss if you don’t speak their language.Not all the colourful expressions of the films of Pedro Almodóvar sound the same when they are translated into another language.Or how can you possibly translate a song by Francis Cabrel or Franco Battiato or Tom Jobim?Languages are worlds - full of colours, smells and athmospheres. Each of them contains a philosophy and a way of thinking.There are surely an infinite amount of pragmatic advantages as well; but I think the greatest advantage of all is that once you learn a new language, you have a key to a different world in your hand.All you have to do is to open the door and enjoy."

1111,"The DeclineIt depends on which Umayyad Caliphate you are talking about.The Umayyad Caliphate in Damascus from 660 C.E. to 750 C.E. was overthrown by a coup d'état led by the Abbassid Family.The Umayyad Caliphate in Cordoba from 711 C.E. to 1038 C.E. ended when the final Caliph, Hisham III, died without any successors.Umayyad Caliphate in DamascusIn the Umayyad Caliphate in Damascus case, there were a few major issues.1) Mawali: Mawali (or non-Arab Muslims) were traditionally excluded from political and social affairs. The Umayyads, in particular, treated them as second-class Muslims. The evidence of this treatment was that Mawali were not allowed to have many government positions and that they were taxed whereas Arab Muslims were not taxed at all. Mawali made up an important component of the Umayyad Caliphate, especially Persians. Persia was always a high seat of culture in the Islamic Empire. As a result, ideas moved quite freely throughout Persia and Persians considered themselves to be of equal worth to Arabs.2) Shiites: Under the Sunni Umayyads, Shiites were also discriminated against. After Yazid I martyred Hussein, the Shiites made it their mission in life to oppose every action of the Umayyad dynasty. It did not help matters that the Umayyads tortured and murdered Shiite Imams and Infallibles, leading to irreconcilability between the Shiites and the Umayyads.3) Distance: There were no effective routes of communication between the Western Edges of the Caliphate and Damascus. This made local administrators more powerful as they would have to make their own decisions anyway (it would take too long for a messenger to go to Damascus and return). Many figured that they might as well make the change more permanent.4) Political Issues: Not all Arabs of high political standing supported the Umayyads. There were several other families that were just as power-hungry and the Umayyads spent much of their time thwarting coups d'état. Abu Al-Abbas As-Saffah of the Abbassids rose against the Umayyads and murdered the reigning Umayyad Caliph. He ordered the rest of his family to murder every single other Umayyad. As a result of the uprising, only one Umayyad, Amir Abd El-Rahman, survived. He would later flee to Spain and set it up as a Caliphate in opposition to the Abbassids.Umayyad Caliphate in SpainThere were really only two issues here.1) Christian Victories: In the mid-800s, the Umayyads in Spain arrived at a turning point. A massive number of Christians were beginning to immigrate to the weak Christian Kingdoms of Leon, Castille, the Basque Provinces, Aragon, Navarre, and Catalonia. Many of the Christians came from France and Germany and brought more recent European technologies with them. This led to the successes of the Reconquista in the late 800s and early 900s. By 1038, King Alfonso VI was ruling the Kingdom of Castille-Leon from Burgos and had El Cid (a famous Spanish general) conquer the Umayyad bastion of Toledo. These Christian victories strongly weakened faith in the longevity of the Umayyad project.2) No Heirs: The Umayyad Caliph Hisham III had no heirs. When he died in 1038, there were no longer any Umayyads left to succeed him and continue the line. He did not style a soldier or bureaucrat to be his successor and regional governors claimed regional authority, resulting in the first Taifa Period of Andalucía.The SolutionThey should have just not done those actions which alienated the Mawali, Shiites, and Christian Spaniards."

1116,"I wouldn’t tell them “not in this house” at all. What possible benefit could that have?If I have a teenager who:Wants to have sex.Has a willing partner who also wants to have sex with them.Then the two of them are going to have sex. There’s nothing I can do about this short of locking them up and throwing away the key. There’s 1001 places teenagers can go to have sex if they’re not allowed to do it at home.And thing is, most of those places are less safe than at home. So what am I hoping to accomplish?Also: Parents who are strongly negative of sexual activity will usually be kept in the dark about all sexual, and often by extension romantic matters involving their child.This prevents the parent from being able to help, if there’s ever a situation where help is wanted or needed. Your daughter has troubles financing the pill this month? Your child is worried about a pregnancy-scare and need someone to talk to? Someone your child was flirting with pushed or crossed a border your child didn’t want crossed?Odds are, if you’re strongly judgemental about sexuality, your child will not feel that it’s safe to come to you and talk about any of these things.As long as the age of the involved is such that there’s no age of consent issues, and as long as there’s no red flags in the relationship, I think it’s perfectly fine for my children (I’ve got 2 daughters and a son) to have sex at home.I’d do my best not to disturb them, and make no mention of having heard them unless they specifically asked. And if they did ask, I’d make the response as non-embarassing and accepting as possible, something like: “It’s none of my business what you guys are up to, as long as everyone involved are consenting and having fun you’re welcome to have your girlfriend/boyfriend sleep over whenever they like.”This might seem extraordinary to some of you; but it’s a fairly common parental attitude here in Scandinavia, back in 1991 when I had my first serious girlfriend at age 15/16, both my parents and her parents had the very same attitude: no problem as long as we’re kind to each other and take care to avoid unwanted pregnancy."
1117,"I had gotten married and we immediately tried to have kids. A year later, when nothing was happening, we went to the fertility specialist. Turns out my ex had a chromosomal abnormality and we would never have biological kids together. After a couple of rounds of IVF with donor sperm (trust me, it wasn’t donated, it was $800 per month!) I called up social services and got on the foster-adopt track.After taking the classes, doing the CORIs, references, physicals, home study, etc. we were approved to foster-adopt. However, since we were looking for a child 3 or younger without any major health issues they said that it might be a while, and they would give us a call when they had someone for us to meet. My ex and I decided that when we received a child, even if it was just for fostering and not adopting, that I would quit my job and stay at home.At that time I was an office manager for a small business. I had worked there for a few years and was quite content there. Time went by. Time went on and on and on. Months and months and months passed. I kept busy with my work. Until one day I got to work, and I could tell something was wrong.A co-worker was cleaning out his desk; he had been laid off. And the human resources guy was heading for my office with a sad, pitying look on his face. I was the other person laid off that day. I packed up my personal items, went to my car, and cried.The money wasn’t the issue; my then-husband made enough for me to stay at home. It was the fact that work kept my mind off thinking about how sad I was that I wasn’t a mother, and it was possible that I might never get to be one.I decided to treat myself to a little retail therapy on the way home. I had all the time in the world now, my ex wouldn’t be home from work for hours. I headed to the store, and started looking at baby clothes, feeling really sad.My phone rang as I was looking at onesies and fighting off tears. It was a number I didn’t know, so I almost let it go to voicemail. However, I was hoping that it might be one of the owners of my company, inviting me back. I answered.It was the social worker from DCF. She said that she had a baby for me to meet. She asked me if I had time that afternoon. I got to meet my son on the same day that I got laid off. Unbeknownst to me, I had become a Stay-At-Home-Mom the moment that I had gotten laid off earlier that day.In case you’re curious, he’s 10 now."

1119,"Thanks, mate! You are right, I´m trying to build a model for the prediction of car sales using six (macroeconomic and automotive-specific) leading indicators.The input data is highly non-linear (stock market prices, interest rates...), identifying a pattern will be quite a challenge. This is why Ì`m going to employ a feed-forward artificial neural network (ANN) model which is known for its strong pattern classification capabilities.However, before I start training the ANN, I need to know what kind of lead-lag relationship is behind the input-output data. My goal is to adjust the underlying data set so that each value of the selected lead time indicator variable is matched with the appropriate value of the modeled variable.Back to your suggestion: I`ll carry out a cross-correlation analysis to uncover the strength of relationship between the output and each input variable. As regards this approach, I have three questions left:1. Does it make sense to use a (bivariate) cross-correlation approach even though there`s more than one input variable involved in the model? Wouldn`t it be interesting/necessary to know how the entire set of input variables are correlated with each other? 2. As my input data is highly non-linear, I guess it makes sense to refer to Spearman's rank correlation coefficient? 3. Is there anything else I should consider in my approach? Pre-tests, autocorrelation...Cheers!Jupp"

1123,"The US dropped more bombs in Vietnam War than in World War 2, so the entire campaign, not just the Secret War.People thought of World War 2 as a grand epic conflict. Well, it does in terms of the number of people involved. So does the battle of Chibi (Red Cliff), but the destruction is much less apparent, because the technology of war evolves with time. During the World War 2, people often read or watch about 500+ US bombers over German cities.The bombers that you often think about during World War 2 are probably:Boeing B-17 Flying Fortresses:A big 4-engined plane. Look at how massive the thing is from this picture. The most produced variant of the famous bomber (B-17G) has enough room to carry 7.8 tons of bombs at maximum. But typically, it carried 3.6 tons on short-range missions (under 400 miles).Next, will be the Consolidated B-24 Liberator, the work horse of the US Strategic bomber force in Europe.It has similar payload capacity to the B-17G, with the most numerous variants (B-24J) carrying 3.6 tons at short range mission. It can however, fly slightly further than B-17.Well, why the gigantic US bombers didn’t carry as much bombs as a typical British ones? For example, an Avro Lancaster can carry up to 9 tons when overloaded, and typically 6.3 tons of bombloads.So the Americans developed the Boeing B-29 Superfortress, capable of hauling 9 tons at most mission profiles. It carried the first atom bombs too.Massive?Now here is where most people get it wrong, it is all about perspectives.The picture above is the cabin size of Boeing B-29 Superfortress. Now you can’t say that a Southwest’s Boeing 737–700 or easyJet’s Airbus A319 are cramped now?That’s what you get with technology and progress: it goes not only with the typical citius altius and fortius, but also size.Going further, USA developed the Convair B-36 Peacemaker. The size of the thing?It simply dwarves the B-17 and B-29 altogether. It also loads 33 tons of bomb, or nearly 4 times the carrying capacity of B-29. But B-36 is powered by 6 rear-facing propeller engines and 4 outboard mounted jet engines, which makes it rather slow and vulnerable to surface anti-aircraft missiles. So they developed this monster, which is deployed in numbers during the Vietnam War:The Boeing B-47 Stratojet and B-52 Stratofortress. The B-52 carried about the same amount of load as the B-36, but with faster speeds and higher altitude.And nope, this is not the surprise. You may think that a giant bomber like B-52 carrying about 10 times the load of the famed B-17 bomber is impressive.But a small fighter jet that dominates the Vietnam sky like this McDonnell-Douglas F-4B Phantom II:It can carry 8.4 tons of bomb, that is more than twice the load of B-17 or B-24.This is the typical tactical bomber / ground attack plane of USA during Vietnam war, the Republic F-105 Thunderchief. It has a carrying capacity of 6.4 tons, easily twice of that a 4-engined world war 2 bombers.So, have your perspective changed yet? To surpass the amount of bombs dropped in world war 2 was not too difficult for USAF when even the smallest bomber in your arsenal can easily carry twice the weight of bombs of your largest strategic bomber of World War 2 era.Oh just for the sake of it, let’s try this smallest jet plane employed by US Navy in Vietnam War: the Douglas A-4 Skyhawk:It can carry 4.5 tons worth of munitions. Yes, even the tiniest, single engine plucky simple cheap jet fighter of Vietnam era laughs at the Memphis Belle “massive” strategic bomber B-17G Flying Fortresses’ 3.6 tons load capacity."

I’m not a lot of certain why this hasn’t been enforced since Roku has been around for years currently, however it’s definitely one thing i'd wish to see.In google I scan some have mentioned PopPrism. This app is pretty terrible and that i wouldn’t advocate it. I attempted it a couple of year past and it had been nearly utterly non-functional. I even have not tried the ‘Web’ app that charges a monthly fee to be used.The solution I found is screen mirroring. Screen mirroring is comparable to Apple AirPlay or Chromecast. This needs you to possess another device that's capable of mirroring, and connected to a similar network, to basicly cast your laptop or mobile device screen to your Roku device. If you look in Roku settings/system you may realize a setting to enable mirroring.This answer works nice with my android tablet. Android will cast to your Roku natively while not putting in the other apps. Newer Windows operative systems are capable of casting to Roku.On my system, I goto settings/connections/connect &amp; share. Click screen mirroring and your Roku media player can show up if it's connected to your network. Don’t forget to change screen mirroring on your Roku device initial.How to use screen mirroring with your mobile deviceBackgroundScreen mirroring allows you to replicate (or “mirror”) the screen of your compatible Android or Windows® device wirelessly onto your TV screen, letting you share (or “cast”) web pages, videos, photos, music, and more via your Roku® streaming player or Roku TV.Notes: To use screen mirroring, both your Roku® streaming device and your mobile device must be connected to the same wireless network. Screen mirroring is not supported on iOS® or Apple devices, or on Google devices (such as a Google Nexus or Pixel) running OS 6.0 or later.These devices can display videos, photos, and music using Play On Roku with the Roku mobile app. The Roku mobile app is a free application for iOS and Android devices. Screen mirroring is not supported on all Roku devices. You can use the Roku device comparison chart to determine which products support screen mirroring for Android and Windows devices.Do I need to enable screen mirroring on my Roku device?You may need to enable screen mirroring if your device is running Roku OS 7.6 or an older software version. To check the software version of your Roku device, go to Settings > System > About.Roku OS 7.7 – If your Roku device is running Roku OS 7.7 and supports screen mirroring, the feature is enabled automaticallyand there is no action required to enable it. Current generation Roku streaming players and Roku TV models are expected to be upgraded to Roku OS 7.7 by the end of August.Roku OS 7.6 – If your Roku device is running Roku OS 7.6 and supports screen mirroring, screen mirroring is enabled by default, but the feature may need to be enabled using the steps below.Press the Home button on your Roku remote.Select Settings and then select System.Select Screen mirroring.After you access the screen mirroring settings, select Enable screen mirroring.How do I mirror or cast from my Android device?If your Android device is running version 4.2 or later (and is not a Google device running OS 6.0 or later), it likely supports screen mirroring.

1125,"Assuming that you are using Excel 2016 on an Office 365 subscription, you already have the ability to add Subscript and Superscript icons to your Quick Access Toolbar (QAT). Select the text to be subscripted or superscripted, click on the respective icon on the QAT, then hit Enter.To use your shortcut keys with keyboard shortcuts, select the text to be subscripted or superscripted, then enter the shortcut key combination. These combinations will vary from one installation to the next, but you can find out what they are on your computer by holding the ALT key down and looking at the QAT. For me, they are ALT + 7 and ALT + 8.To put the subscript and superscript icons on your QATClick the down arrow at the right end of the QAT and choose More Commands… from the bottom of the resulting dialog.Subscript and Superscript are in the Popular Commands category, which should be the default in the next dialogSelect Subscript from the commands shown on the left, then click the Add >> button. Next, select Superscript and click the Add >> button once again.Click OKThis thread gets a lot of page views. Because of those hits, Microsoft added the icons you see in the screenshot above.I met the person responsible for adding the feature in March 2018. I thanked her on behalf of the scientific and engineering community. She said that the page views this thread received made her decision easy.As an Excel MVP, I had been trying for years to convince Microsoft to add icons to the ribbon for superscript and subscript so we can put them on the Quick Access Toolbar (QAT) above the ribbon. Word has suitable icons, so all the Excel development team needed to do was to copy those icons. I got nowhere, however.Microsoft has a new venue to solicit user input for desired features. If a feature request gets 20 votes, it will be looked at. And the more votes it gets after passing this threshold, the higher the priority the idea will receive for implementation. So I urged anyone viewing this thread to take a look at my proposal on Excel UserVoice, and vote for it. You'll have to sign up before you can vote, but the process is painless. My proposal may be found at Add icons for font superscript and subscript so we can put them on the QAT*****On July 10, 2017, Microsoft said in that UserVoice thread: “Starting with the June release of Excel, you have:Quick access to superscript and subscript! Keep the superscript and subscript commands at your fingertips by adding them to the Ribbon or Quick Access Toolbar.” I have version 1705 (Current Channel), and the new icons appear under Popular Commands. Thanks to all who voted for this UserVoice suggestion. Your support really made a difference.There is a related thread on Excel UserVoice that requests the CTRL + and CTRL Shift + shortcut keys for subscript and superscript be applied to Excel. They work in Word and PowerPoint, but are used for other things in Excel. As a frequent user of superscript and subscript, I naturally think that those uses are more important than ""Calculate all"" and ""Insert cells"", which are the current uses of those shortcut key combinations. I have never used those latter shortcut keys and had to look them up (at Chip Pearson's KeyboardShortcuts ) before making this post. If you want to vote for the shortcut key proposal for superscript and subscript, you may find it at Allow CTRL+ and CTRL SHIFT + to set superscript and subscriptI've talked to Microsoft's Excel Product Managers about Excel UserVoice, and they are solidly behind the concept of soliciting input from the user community. They really are paying attention to the ideas being voted up, and you can count on many of them making it into Excel 2016 or future versions. The monthly updates associated with subscription software like Office 365 means that you will see Excel UserVoice suggestions being added to the product as soon as they are ready--I expect at least a few in Spring 2016. So please, please, please--review the ideas on Excel UserVoice, vote up the ones you like, and consider posting your own suggestions."

I didn't think much of it, but she got really upset, so I stayed home, just to keep her calm.

1128,"[Disclosure: I work for AgileBits, the makers of 1Password.]The best tip is that you should let a well designed automated password generator create these. As Troy Hunt summed things up, Troy Hunt: The only secure password is the one you can’t remember.  So use a good password manager with its own strong password generator. For the ones you do need to rememberThere are, of course, some passwords that you do need to remember and type yourself, and this is where there is lots of advice available. Not all of the advice is good advice.When looking at some memorable password creation advice, you should not just consider whether it will work against how automated cracking tools work today, but you should ask, does the advice remain good even if lots of people follow the advise and crackers adjust to that fact.  Another way of looking at this is does the password you create remain strong even if the attacker knows what password creation scheme you followed.Diceware-like schemes.About four years ago, I wrote an article that explained this: Toward Better Master Passwords.  (Hey, that was my 15 minutes of fame, so I'm milking it.) It offered a variant of the  Arnold Reinhold's 1995 Diceware scheme. This involves picking words at random from a list of words. A few weeks later, XKCD popularized the idea even further.What is not made clear in this otherwise excellent comic is that the words must be chosen in a truly random (uniform distribution) fashion.The beauty of these Diceware-like schemes is that they remain strong even under the assumption that the attacker knows what scheme you used. There is no ""security by obscurity"" and this is consistent with Kerchoffs' Principle.  Thus the advice remains good even if enough people follow it that is leads to a change of attacker behavior."
1129,"There are two groups of theories regarding ancient aliens: Annunaki theories; and Reptilian theories. Both types of theories claim the human race did not evolve through Darwinian processes, but had extraterrestrial origins; and both types of theories claim our real history was like the movie/tv series Stargate: with extraterrestrials guiding the development of our society, sharing their technology with us, and playing the role of gods.The Annunaki and Reptilian theories differ on who these “gods” were. The Reptilians are thought to resemble the lizard-people from the tv series V, except they never bothered to disguise themselves as humans. The Annunaki are thought to be more human-looking, except that they were 12-15 feet tall (twice as tall as a tall human). Those who subscribe to the Reptilian theory (that the Reptilians were the “gods”), believe the Annunaki were Reptilians.This is not my view. I believe the Annunaki and the Reptilians were two distinct races, and both played a significant role in shaping human history/development. The majority of researchers believe the Annunaki were the “gods”, and I lean towards this view myself, but I’m not 100% convinced it wasn’t the Reptilians. The problem is that the evidence, and the historical records, that survive from those times (around 12,000 years ago) is fragmentary, and can be interpreted in many different ways: like pieces of a jigsaw puzzle that can fit together in many combinations to form many different pictures.The main difference between the Reptilian and Annunaki theories, is in where they say the human race came from. The Reptilian theory posits that humans originated in the Lyran star system, that they had a war with the Reptilians millennia ago, and that they came to Earth as refugees from that war. But the Reptilians followed them to Earth, and the war continued here. Ultimately, the war climaxed in an exchange of nuclear weapons: many scholars believe the biblical account of the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah is based on a real historical account of how those cities were destroyed by nuclear fire. The war finally came to an end when the Reptilians and the Lyran humans agreed that neither species would rule the Earth: the Earth would instead be ruled by a hybrid of both species. So Reptilian genes and human genes were spliced together to create this hybrid, and that’s us – modern humans.The Annunaki theory tells a different story. The Annunaki came to Earth to mine for minerals, primarily gold, on which most of their technology was based, and which was in short supply on their home planet Nibiru. Nibiru passes close to Earth every 36,000 years – the rest of the time, its highly elliptical orbit carries it well outside our solar system. It was during one of these 36,000 year “fly-bys” the Annunaki came to Earth to mine for gold. But the mining was hard work, and after a few thousand years, the Annunaki tired of it, and started looking for a convenient source of slave labour. Their solution was to take the most highly evolved primate species on the Earth at the time, and graft their own genes on to it. The result was the first humans, who resembled the Annunaki (but were much shorter) because they were “created in God’s image” as the bible says. Some scholars believe the original text of the bible says humans were created in “the gods’ image” meaning gods plural, which would be more historically accurate, given there were many Annunaki. Over time, the Annunaki inter-bred with their creations (our ancestors), so that they came to resemble Annunaki more and more, and the apes they had evolved from, less and less. When the Bible says “There were giants in the Earth, in those days”, it is referring to the Annunaki, and their offspring.The Annunaki became divided into two factions: those that wanted to share their technology with humans; and those that wanted to kee..."

You’ll probably even see some of them in the other answers to this very question.So why won’t you find a smart hacker here?Simple: Smart hackers avoid people who ask “How can I get a smart hacker?”Smart hackers are smart.Smart hackers know that 99% of problems are best solved by other smart people: doctors, teachers, lawyers, engineers, scientists, consultants, and so on. You might not be able to solve them, but there’s no point giving them to a hacker, either. You don’t fix everything with a hammer.Smart hackers know that 99% of the remaining 1% of problems are better left unsolved, unless you want to spend a very long time in prison. People who solve problems by breaking laws are not smart.If your problem is in the 0.01% that is best solved, legally, by a hacker, you will probably be able to ask a much more specific question than “How can I get a smart hacker?”Consider your problem.Consider whether it should be solved.Consider whether a hacker is the best person to ask.Then, ask."
1131,"The Aztecs (full name “Aztec Triple Alliance”) were a military alliance of three neighboring Altepetls (City/States) of Mexica ethnicity (from where we get the name of today’s much larger nation/state, Mexico) and Nahuatl language. The cities were Tenochtitlán, Texcoco and Tlacopan (all of which today are parts of Mexico City).In a “Romanesque” fashion, the alliance spawned an empire that solidified and unified the area of modern Central/Southern Mexico and Northwest Guatemala, including sweeping reforms to state, religion, warfare and overall organization until it was destroyed by the Spanish in 1521.The entire empire was a collection of semi-independent city/states or confederations of them (not all entirely cooperative) that gave taxes to the Aztec Triple alliance in exchange of peace, trade and advanced legal organization. Tlatoanis (Speakers) were rulers of their own city/states, and the Huey Tlatoani (Great Speaker) in Tenochtitlán was the ultimate ruler.Moctezuma II, Huey Tlatoani of the Empire at the time of Spanish arrival.Here is a map of the land extension of the empire as different rulers incorporated more territory.They were not the only natives by a long shot - the entire area of modern Mexico was highly populated, with kingdoms, confederations and independent Altepetls, speaking over 68 languages split into hundreds of sub-dialects. But they were by far the most influential in the area (along with the Mayas in the Yucatán, which by then were in civilizational decline).Note however that cultural influence and political divisions are two different things..Ater the Spanish conquest, the Empire itself died, but the people in it, augmented by the enormous influx of Spanish newcomers and now renamed/re-acculturated as “The Viceroyalty of New Spain” - gradually conquered and dominated the rest of the peoples in the entire area and well into the US Southwest - and even reached the Philippines (conqueror Legazpi, who lived in Mexico for 30 years, sailed out of Barra de Navidad, Jalisco). This is called the “Colonial era”. Three hundred years later, things looked like this :This map illustrates the official territorial divisions already well into the Mexican Independence war, which became a reality 2 years later, in 1821. Note the “Kingdom of Mexico”, the start of it all and seat of the Viceroyal government. The Viceroy at Mexico City was also governor-general of the Philippines, and that conquest was by now so old today’s Texas was the “New Philippines”.So when the area achieved its independence and became a modern nation/state, the new country was named after the original Mexica: Mexico, and its capital, Mexico City, is now the capital of the whole nation. This is why a lot of the native iconography of modern Mexico and the areas influenced by it - from California to well into Central America - either directly refers to or is influenced by the Mexica people, colloquially known as the “Aztecs”."

1133,"Complications like infection can lengthen the time it takes to heal up, but here is a general timeline:Swelling and pain will be the greatest during the first 3 days (peaking at about 48hours).Normally, the sockets should take about 2 weeks to 1 month to cover over with solid gum tissue after scabbing first. This is where I guess most people feel like they have ""healed"" up. The underlying bone will fill in and remodel over the course of roughly 6 months.Naturally, factors like post-op infection, the size of the 'hole,' etc. can play a role in how long it will take to heal. In the mean time, it is important to keep things clean and try not to play with the 'scab.'"
1134,"Her accomplishments are numerous and not just limited to her time as SOS. But I have restricted my answer to a list of accomplishments while she was SOS. I is sad that most people just want to ignore or dismiss Clinton but that is just easy irresponsible copout. I would think that after eight Benghazi investigations where nothing was found that implicated Clinton wrong doing people would wake up and see the witch hunts against Clinton are purely motivated. Especially after Rep Kevin McCarthy came out and said it publicly that all this was for the purpose of killing her poll numbers.So here is my list: American foreign policy was stronger when Hillary Clinton left the State Department than when she arrived. She took the reins from a Bush administration that had left America’s reputation deeply damaged and planted the seeds for the foreign policy successes we see today.Iran sanctions. Sec. Clinton accomplished the nearly impossible mission of getting China, Russia, the European Union and the civilized world on board with crippling sanctions against Iran. This is what brought Iran to the negotiating table.Key in rebuilding America’s leadership and prestige overseas after the Bush years. She restored our alliances with the EU and key Asian allies as well as key relationships in Africa and Latin America.Management of the State Department during which time we saw a 50 percent increase in exports to China.Aggressive work on climate (particularly at Copenhagen).She negotiated the cease-fire in Gaza that stopped the Hamas from firing rocket after rocket into Israel.She helped secure the START treaty’s ratification.Secretary Clinton was also an outspoken champion for women around the world. She set records for travel while leading the State Department and used every trip to empower the women of the 112 countries she visited. She made gender equality a priority of U.S. foreign policy. And she created the ambassador at large for global women’s issues, a post charged with integrating gender throughout the State Department.Normalization of relations with Cuba. After 55 years of sanctions that accomplished nothing except to galvanize the Castro regime, reason has finally set in.Nearly every foreign policy victory of President Obama’s second term has Secretary Clinton’s fingerprints on it.(Oh yes Obama has an impressive list of accomplishment as well)."
1135,"In economic sense (as far as I know…) Growth is a process of expanding or becoming large over a certain period. It specifically has nothing to do as far as qualitative expansion is concerned or in other words it is a term which depicts quantitative enlargement of a particular thing.Whereas,Development is a wider term and includes growth i.e it is more of a comprehensive concept which not only includes quantitative enlargement but also includes qualitative expansion.Growth may or may not be good for a particular criteria (or at least in economics..) but Development more often signifies a positive attitude..Now let's take an exampleThe population of our country is growingthe sentence expresses the increase or expansion of population but this may not be a good indication for our economyIn another example,The industrial sector of our country has developed over the decadeNow in this sentence development of a sector is expressed to have happened and this indeed is a good indication for our economy!That is why rate of development is used in real senses to compare two aspects as it gives an accurate and correct base on which those two aspects should be compared….After all quality matters more than quantity!I hope it helped…thanks for reading and my apology if I've made any mistake :-):-)"
1136,"This is a technique known as 'shadowing' that I learnt in Japanese class, which I find tremendously helpful for short-term oral fluency improvement.Watch your favorite English language TV show or movie, and as the characters speak, repeat loudly the exact words they are saying the moment you hear them. In other words, 'shadow' their dialogue in real-time. Don't worry about getting every word or sound right - focus on listening carefully, moving along quickly and keeping pace. After the movie ends, repeat the exact same movie and do it again. And again.By forcing yourself to speak at native speed, your brain becomes hyper-receptive to what you are hearing, and you will find yourself not only picking up the words quicker and quicker, but also unconsciously mimicking the inflections and vocal nuances that are usually difficult to learn for a non-native. It will also fix the stammer that comes with uncertainty or lack of confidence. In this way, the actors in the movie become your speaking partners.This will be perfect practice just before your interview. Look for some interview practice videos on YouTube, then shadow the entire conversation. Practice the same dialogs again and again. You will be amazed how that will improve not only your speaking, but also your ability to actively listen and react. Best of luck."
1137,"I would like to share my personal experience. I had tried to present my idea in front of PM Narendra Modi in 2017 and got success in it. Frankly speaking you will require lot of patience to get response from PMO(Prime Minister Office). I wanted to share one idea, which was based on “How to stop food wastage using IT software”, to PM Narendra Modi. Firstly, you should know what are the things to be included in your application.In my application, I have added three important documents:I made one short Project portfolio describing my project idea, it was short and precise consisting of four pages. Content and length depends on what you want to present.One letter to PM Narendra Modi (hand written letter), it’s length was of one page. It is necessary if you write a letter by your hand because it attracts the attention more than printed letter. You can see the regular format letter written to PM of India and edit it based on what is your purpose behind meeting PM.Short introduction of myself, it is the most important document in your application because it decides that whether you are eligible candidate to present your idea to PM Modi. I have mentioned in that document about myself (short bio of what is my qualification and why do i want to present this idea) and few background details about myself, which attracts attention the most if they find it genuine.In order to make my application look different and eye catching, I made the cover of application through Black Chart paper with photos of PM Modi and mine as well on the cover page besides To and From address.Secondly, after knowing the content of what to write in application, I would like to show you the correct way to make sure your efforts don’t go in vain. So, here are the steps that I performed to achieve the task of making them read about my idea. I would say this is the most difficult task to achieve. I will tell you something interesting that will make you feel confident that you too can get positive result after knowing my number of trials that I made to achieve expected result. But before listening to my number of trials here are the three methods I followed to achieve my results.Application sent to PM Modi address: “Honorable Prime minister of India, 7 Race Course Road, New Delhi”.Application sent to PMO address: “South Block, Raisina Hill, New Delhi-110011” Phone no: 011-23014547, +91-11-23012312”.Online application through “Interact with PM” portal.Once i have tried to apply my application on Narendra Modi’s email-id: narendramodi1234@gmail.com. (I would not suggest you this way because there is 99% chances that your email will go unnoticed.)ATTEMPTS OF APPLICATIONI have started my application in the month of May 2017 and I regularly sent one application online through “Interact with PM” portal and continued till July 2017. Apart from online application, I sent application (consisting of letter, project portfolio and short bio of myself in a cover made by me) through India speed post regularly on alternate days of week. I carried out this speed post task from May 2017 till Aug 2017. So by summing up all this application I made 23 online portal application and 56 speed post application. Don’t you feel encouraged by knowing the number of application.REPLY OF APPLICATIONNow, I would like to say something positive, I have started receiving positive reply from 19th July 2017 of application which was dated on May 2017. You can never be sure that whether you will receive response from your speed post letter application or online application. Since my project was related to ministry of Food processing department it was sent to that department along with some other department like Digital India (Ministry of Communication and Information Technology) because of software proposal. I kept on getting many reply from PMO from month of July 2017 till October 2017 from different mini..."

1139,"If you are asking about a transwoman, we are born with normal male gentilia and we have Sex Reassignment Surgery to reconstruct it to identify ourselves as woman, many are happy to live with it and don't have the surgery at all depending how the Society tolerates them and how comfortable they are living with it.In the case of Hermaphrodites, they have ambiguous gentilia, they necessarily might not be transgenders but since they do not have fully developed gentilia, they have minor surgery to correct it, like a man could be born with a vagina and a penis in the place of clitoris. A woman could be born with a penis and a vagina as well.Some people are intersex which means they may have both gentilia just like a Hermaphrodite but what differentiates them from Hermaphrodites is their sex chromosomes might have an extra chromosome like XXX, XXY, XYX, XYY and numerous other combinations.If you are asking about the hijras, they might be a transwoman/transsexual, Hermaphrodite, intersex etc...Please do note that Eunuchs are entirely different from hijras, transsexuals, intersexed, Hermaphrodites etc... As eunuchs are men who have been castrated for various reasons, in history orphan men were castrated to serve the queen and the Noble women folk, poor male boys who sang beautifully like a girl and made a living for their families were castrated to stop the cracking of their voice.So thinking a hijra is a eunuch is ignorance because they aren't men. Hijras are just like any transwoman/transsexuals but they live in a special culture and tradition of their own, like a tribe/caste etc..."
1140,"`When you have decided to take up armed forces as your career choice, you should give few aspirations in life. Perks such as flexible work timings, weekends off, switching jobs for better compensation package you do not like the current , spending time with family. You will be entering a world or a bubble which is completely different from the way you have seen and experienced outside it. You would be kept completely impervious and insulated from the developments around world (except news), like people who joined academy when there was a trend of disc man and Walkman, but when they graduated they saw an iPod, technology had rapidly progressed. Your thought process and thinking is conditioned in a manner such that you always have the safety, security, integrity and honor of your men and regiment on top of your mind. You would be required to develop apt listening skills and listen, listen very carefully and diligently as if your are listening to your senior’s instructions for the last time and also acknowledge them, because in the face of war or a threat these instructions spell out the difference between life and death. Then comes speaking, you should be able to speak, speak in assertive and an exhorting tone as you need to be heard and followed, because one day when you rise up to be a senior yourself, you too would need to pass on instructions and commands to your boys who have put their faith in you to lead them to victory.All this happens the day you join the academy, you are tested and constantly kept on toes to pay attention to detail and made sure that your psychology is conditioned to perform under worse of conditions. You are persistently made uncomfortable and pushed beyond your endurance limits, thrown in a chaotic environment, so that your decision making and thinking process never gets clouded and your body remains in great physical shape. All this is done so that when you are expected to rise up to the occasion you are in capacity to lead your men and your mind and soul remains as one functioning entity. One of the first lessons you are taught in the academy are these implicit lessons which are actually not part of the regular academic curriculum but are imparted by the seniors . Respect, towards your fellow men in the uniform is the most paramount lesson.Next coming to the work. The responsibilities shouldered upon you at any point of time would be staggering, demanding, dynamic and most importantly TOUGH. The definition of tough greatly varies here from the outside perception. Life is basically very challenging and it consumes your life completely in the army, it is primarily because you are dealing with lives of human beings(which would never want to risk) and it becomes all the more daunting because these men trust you with their life. Every word, every action you make is understood as an order to be executed and when an order is passed there is no looking back, by all means the objective has to achieved. This how we are trained, conditioned and tempered. The training and life in the academy might seem preposterous to folks outside, thinking that when we are not going to fight a war anytime soon why train so hard and rigorously, but if you look through the prism of rationality it is a process of annealing a man into a soldier i.e, “the more you sweat in peace, the less you bleed in war” as famously quoted by Gen. Norman Schwarzkopf . So there is no looking back or questioning the order, things have to just get moving.Tough, life in the army is also due to many reasons , one of which is army is an organization which gives no revenue or yields no tangible profits to the government in spite of it spending billions. Our functions and operations are carried out on the funding by the taxpayers money, which is hard earned. We understand the value of the rupee that a taxpayer is willing to part with. Each and every equipment or inventory ranging from a small 10 mm round to the ICBM is taken into account and is constantly updated and checked. We cannot at all costs afford to waste the tax payers money. Every rupee spent on any activity is registered into an account and there are certain measures that are put in place to ensure there is no misappropriation of funds. Very few people know this, the Government of India spends certain amount(quite a lot) on training its officers and enhancing their professional capabilities at various phases of their career paths, any point after the training if the officer wishes to opt out from the service he has to pay back the sum of money spent on him by the Government. And people have a perception that we in armed forces get everything for free. So why am I telling you this ? This was a real life incident, that was experienced by one of my colleague in his regiment. Just days before the regiment was ready to move for a practice camp in Rajasthan firing ranges, everything was packed ready and checked , during the final scrutiny by the CO it was found out that few ammunition shells were missing in the count, to their horror it was revealed that they were no where to found in the regiment campus. Then came the mayhem the entire battalion of 600 odd men and CO himself swung into swift action to find the few missing shells. Because there are a lot of possibilities about the missing ammunition shells, it may land up in undesirable hands. Finally after relentless search of 2 days 3 nights it was found that the ammunition was loaded on to another regiments cargo truck which too at that time was waiting to be loaded and heading for practice camp. This incident would have invited a court of inquiry or a possible court martial proceedings on the officers and the JCOs responsible and the CO himself, if they would not have been able to trace the missing pieces of ammunition.These were some of the tense moments for the entire regiment. Because all of this unfolded in a peace station which is relatively safe and calm place the implications were not far reaching. The dynamics are suddenly altered when you are placed in a sensitive area. Because you are a warrior by profession and you are meant to fight. The tasks here become unimaginably challenging and gruelling, because here what ever you do would have a far reaching impact over the lives around you, be the men in uniform or the civilians for whose aid you are stationed there. There is some one always on look out out to kill you , do harm to your men, bring disharmony among the civilians and you have to pacify yourself that your name is not written on the enemy’s bullet. Its not that we are scared of the enemy or afraid to loose or die, but its the thought which moves us deeply, that when the Government has spent millions on my training and equipment, positioned me with the best fighting force how can i be perished with a crude IED or cheap ammo supplied from across the border? I am trained to be a superior fighter and silence those have taken up guns against the country than a pen or a keyboard. Self motivation and holding up to the values of regimental traditions that in the past have bought glory to the nation, is what drives a soldier to accomplish his task effectively in those challenging conditions.So my answer to the question may have projected the life in the army not suitable for every one. Yes that’s true not every one can endure and stand the rigors of what life throws at you as your progresses begins to unfold in the army. But let me also tell you that LIFE in here is unparalleled , you will not embrace so many career profiles at one job as you could do it in the army. You would be a HR manager , a techie , a sportsman and most importantly a soldier the best and the elite.Then Comes the most difficult and sad part to digest. After you have completed your objective and mission is accomplished we are patted by our boss, ‘WELL DONE SHER’ and we applaud each of our team for doing a great job. We return home, we see citizens of our country who take to their liberty to express their opinions with out even upholding certain moral values of what a democracy has bestowed on them and openly question our actions and our operational motives. And we feel awfully ashamed when we realize that our men have bled for these arm chair critics who are completely impervious of the ground realities and are not able to think that what if all that (operation) was taking place in my back yard, how safe would i have been. When the enemy is bringing war to your own turf how could you expect us to sit quite and welcome them with humility. Well will you ever sit calm when some else is encroaching on your land or property , NO i am sure no one will, you will instead resort to legal action and call up all influential people in that locality to help resolve your case. I know how bad and hapless one feels if they are to part away with their land. Let alone be it some one coming and doing harm to you. But still we will not pay heed to those misinformed critics who debate on our efforts to bring peace and normality. We still are not bogged down by these debates and criticism, we are still a fighting force.Its not always work , guns, tense situations, drills , unpleasant events , there is also a bright part about the life in the army. Army has some of the best sports infrastructure which is envied by people outside. After your work you could take stroll through the ecological park and training area to hit a few practice shots or head to the swimming pool for a cool dip. In the evenings you could head to the club for a social evening. Then there are your friends and family who make your life all the more loving and fun. In the evenings you could head to the club to trip out and socialize with your men. Your work will take you places that people only dream of , you have a privileged access to certain places if you are stationed there (obvious for sure) even if you are willing to spend millions you wont be able to match to our standards of managing a tour to these locations. You get to drive and test some of the best equipment the force has in its inventory, where else would you get that? And the most important and actually the best part you meet people from such varied and rich backgrounds and end up living a retirement life as neighbors . That is trust and bond that the organization imbibes in its men.PS-1.) Please don’t take this piece of writing as in actual life in the army though it varies , most of it remains same.2.) Army is still and will be the best career choices for the youngsters, just check for yourself how much an engineer fresher gets paid vs a newly commissioned officer in the army. Apart from the job security and satisfaction.3.) Though initially i did not want to answer this question , but then i thought, I have to , because most of us remain in dark and let people be speculative about us and delude our capabilities and intentions for the country.Jai Hind"
1141,"Understandably, Chinese speakers have some peculiar difficulties when trying to learn English. For one thing, English is a stress-timed language in which the stress of the sentence determines the rhythm of the language, while Chinese is a syllable-timed language.The alphabets, too, are different. This means that not only the languages look different on paper, they also sound very different, as English and Chinese have very few common sounds. This makes it that much more difficult for Chinese speakers to nail English pronunciation.So let’s go over some things that will help you become fluent in English.1. Practice self-listening and listening to native English speech.What I recommend to my Chinese speaking students is to listen extensively to native speech (podcasts, Youtube, the news, etc.) and compare the sounds that they produce themselves to native English sounds. Hearing the difference is an important step in overcoming the pronunciation barrier.While you listen, pay attention to the rhythm of speech as well and try to imitate it. Listen to short sections of native speech and repeat after the speakers. It’s a great way to get used to the unusual “music” of the language.2. Physical trainingPeople move their mouths in different ways when speaking Chinese as opposed to English. While speaking Chinese requires more of a closed mouth, English prefers a more open jaw position.This is why it’s important to actually train your mouth to produce the needed English sounds. Practice in front of the mirror and really make an effort with this one until it becomes second nature.3. ReadAn important part of achieving fluency is understanding the nuances of the language – slang words, idioms, etc. Reading is your gateway to that.Being fluent in a language means being aware of the culture as well, which is why you should read anything and everything to help you grasp those insights and connect the dots in your head.4. Practice with a native speakerFinally, when it comes to getting fluent in English, nothing beats practice with a native speaker. If you think you don’t have that opportunity, don’t worry – you can always do it online with English Ninjas.At English Ninjas, we match you with a native English speaking instructor, who will help you achieve that coveted fluency at your own convenience, as often as you need. As a Quora user, you will also get a special discount."
1142,"Oh, so much wrong with this question.First, “Science” is not a belief system. You seriously undermine and misrepresent science when you propose that people “believe … Science”.Science is the study of the physical universe. Period. We do not “believe” in science. We accept or reject scientific theories based on the data.Second, this is NOT an either/or choice. You do realize that, at least, half of scientists believe in God, right? Science itself is agnostic. Science is NOT atheistic. Science cannot know whether deity (God) exists or not. As Stephen Jay Gould put it:""To say it for all my colleagues and for the umpteenth millionth time (from college bull sessions to learned treatises): science simply cannot (by its legitimate methods) adjudicate the issue of God's possible superintendence of nature. We neither affirm nor deny it; we simply can't comment on it as scientists."" SJ Gould, Impeaching a self-appointed judge. Scientific American, 267:79-80, July 1992.Third, most Judeo-Christians believe in God and accept science. I suggest you look at denominational statements here: http://www.ncseweb.com/resources/articles/4650_statements_from_religious_orga_3_13_2001.aspFourth, let’s consider those theists who believe creationism. They are the ones that reject various scientific theories, i.e. evolution. Let’s consider this from within their theism. Creationists do not have the problem of “believe God rather than science”. No, they have the problem of not believing God. They believe God created the universe. So, what did God create? Creation (the universe). What does science study? Creation (the universe). So creationists have the problem of not believing what God tells us in His Creation. It’s not a matter of “believe God rather than science” for them, but rather “believe their (human) interpretation of the Bible or believe God.”"
1143,"Anuj Kalia has given an implementation which is usually known as the Hash join algorithm, specifically one can think of his implementation as a simple implementation of Grace Hash-join. However, his implementation has a small bug. He is assuming that the join key is unique for each tuple which need not necessarily be the case. The fix to his code is very simple and small and it can be easily be made to work for the case I mention.There are other ways to implement the same algorithm. Anuj Kalia's implementation is fast and it will work really well for joining small files. However, if you have one very large file and one very small file, you can go with the classic hash-join algorithm where you place the small file in the hash table and do the join while scanning through the bigger file. This is a slower but memory friendly implementation.However, what if both the files to be joined are very large?In that case, we usually go with Sort-merge join algorithm. As the name suggests, what we do here is that we sort the two files and then in the merge operation we do the join. For sorting large files, we use what is called as the External sorting algorithm.Check out all the linked wikipedia pages in my answer and work through them. Join algorithms can be fun to implement.Are there other join algorithms?Yes. Category:Join algorithmsAddendum:What you are trying to achieve is called Inner Join [1]. If you have enough interest, you should definitely try to modify the code for Left Join, Right Join and Outer Join.[1] Join (SQL)"

1146,"Yes, fried food is unhealthy for at least three reasons:Fat is very calorie dense and easily puts you over your daily caloric needs.Components in meat heated beyond 100 degrees Celsius are converted to heterocyclic amines that cause all sorts of cancers Heterocyclic amine formation in meat - Wikipedia.The fat or oil used for frying is either saturated fat or polyunsaturated fat, or a mixture of the two. Saturated fat is heat resistant but is unhealthy by itself already. While polyunsaturated can be healthy if eaten in tiny amounts, the unsaturated fats are damaged by the heat of frying and become a source of free radicals that attack your body tissues and DNA, causing premature ageing and cancer."

1148,"I can't speak for students from other programs, but as an engineering student, I can tell you that attending Waterloo is one of the most difficult but rewarding experience you will have. Personally, the first term was the hardest to stomach. The workload is significantly heavier than high school, you're going to get homesick to a certain degree, people are significantly smarter and more hardworking, and on top of that you have to worry about co-op. The food kind of sucks in general. Second year and third year is probably much worse in terms of workload, but you start to learn managing your time a lot better. The social scene...well let's just say it helps you to stay focused to your work. You can always find parties and social events but you have to look for it. You will make a lot of great friends here, but not unlike yourself, your friends are buried with work and won't have all the time in world to chitchat. Spending time in Waterloo makes you socialize in a more efficient manner.Co-op is extremely valuable. It teaches you what it takes to make it in the real world early on. At the time you graduate, you gain a tremendous amount of industry knowledge, and this give you a competitive advantage comparing to your peers without it. It also helps you pay some tuition so you won't be completely buried in debt after graduation. Most importantly, you're also well connected with peers with industry experiences. It's not easy though, trying to manage job application and interviews on top of everything else (lectures, assignments, studying, extracurricular, social, midterms) can get hectic. I've connected with some of my close friends in high school who went to York, McMaster, Ryerson, UofT, and Memorial. It's kind of a shocker to me know that none of them actually knows how much work it takes to build a good career, it's like they're disconnected to the real world. I was talking about running my own startup when they are asking me how to write a resume. I also realized that in co-op, I learned soft skills (networking, teamwork, communication, etc) that they just don't seem to have. Definitely don't regret coming here."
1149,"First thing you should understand is that there is no spot reduction techniques.Having said that there are few exercises which can help reduce fat in those mentioned areas like free squats, jumping jacks, burpees, plank, crunches,high knees,mountain climbers,sumo squats.Circuit Training is also very helpful in reducing fat(best possible solution in this case) but all these should be done with a proper diet. The amount of calories you take in should be a little lower than what you can burn throughout the day.(you should learn to calculate your macros)Stuff like curd or lassi(without sugar) is very efficient in reducing fat and kills hunger for quite some time.You should also go for weight lifting if you can manage a gym membership. (It is belived to be better than cardio .)But the most important thing is your diet. You should avoid junk as much as possible and go for healthier alternatives and increase your regular protien intake. Have atleast 6 to 7 meals a day. You should not have too much carbs for your dinner(try to avoid rice or roti). And your breakfast should be heavy. Well thats all i know about fat loss. Hope it helps. Good luck!!P.s. : It doesn't happen overnight. You have to really work hard for it."
1150,"RNA and DNA are different in various aspects-RNA is single stranded molecule while DNA ca be either double or single stranded(though very few viruses have been seen having dsRNA and dsRNA is also seen in RNA interference techniques).DNA is meant for storage of genetic information while RNA is meant for expression of the stored genetic information.DNA depends upon RNA for gene expression through RNA dependent protein synthesis machinery.DNA has 4 nitrogenous bases viz. Adenine , cytosine , guanine and thymine while RNA also has 4 bases , the only difference being that instead of thymine , uracil is present.DNA is a highly stable compound and undergoes mutations mainly bcoz of the action of mutagens while RNA is a labile and fragile structure and can mutate at high rates even in the absence of mutagens ex. during any sort of replication or expression mechanism of the cell.This is the reason why viral infections involving RNA viruses and Retroviruses are dificult to cure as the virus mutates against the medication and renders it useless.These are a few points. Ask for more if you need.Hope it helps!"

1153,"thanks for A2A Radhika.You will get many answers “What is Happiness” , I’ll answer it differently.Do these things and “You will never be Happy”Always ask the question WHY ME?ill share some of my experiences when i asked myself “WHY ME”When I was 16, I got involved in a fight with all of my friends, suffered judicial custody ( though never went to jail) . This left me all alone. I asked myself Why me?When I was 19, had my 1st break up. I was shattered, I was broken, I cried and asked Why me?When I was 21, I couldn’t get a good rank in GATE after studying 10 hrs per day for 1 entire year, then I looked up and asked Why me?When I was 22, I was in Chennai, had train next day, had very limited money, spent entire night in a railway station so that I can save money of relaxing in a hotel room. While waiting at the station I cried and asked, Why Me?When I was 24, I got 9.90 cgpa in Mtech, got placed in the very first company that came, joined the company and left the job in 5 months due to lack of satisfaction. Applied for 4 iit’s for PhD, rejected by all and again I looked up and said………..why me?Now when i am 25, After working my ass off, Just before my 1st exam in IIT, got chicken pox and asked by docs to take complete bed rest for 15 days, as usual I looked up and asked Why me?All these questions of WHY ME brought so much of chaos in my life that i forgot to see the positivity in anything and ended up getting into depression.2. Try to please Everyone Possiblewhosoever you meet, whether young or old, male or female, human or animal, just try to please everyone. This will completely destroy your self-respect and will create a chaos in your life. This way you will never be happy.There was a time when i was 17, I use to be a bully, i was more interested in making more and more friends to make a large group of friends. This way i changed my personality to impress others.It was soon, i realized, when i got stuck in a major problem, no-one other than my parents helped me get out of the problem.Thus, if you dont want to be happy, change your personality and try to impress everyone possible.Thus, the answer to your question that how do you define happiness is just“Happiness is anything that does not include above mentioned 2 things “God Bless. Love you So much."

1155,"Losing weight is almost totally driven by food choices (what and how much). Exercise (such as walking, running, and workouts) is excellent for fitness and for making sure that the weight you lose is fat and not muscle, but the caloric benefits of exercise are easily swamped by poor food choices. Running a mile burns less than 200 calories (see: How Many Calories Do You Lose Per Mile?), so if you ran two miles a day, and then had a donut to celebrate (450 calories)—well, you see the problem. The idea that those who exercise a lot can then anything they want doesn’t work, in general.In contrast, even quite sedentary people can easily lose weight if they make good food choices. Exercise is neither necessary nor sufficient for weight loss, but good food choices are both necessary and sufficient to lose weight.My current diet advice is here, and it’s simple, easy, effective, satisfying (you won’t feel hungry), involves no calorie counting, and offers an easy transition from weight loss to weight maintenance, always tricky. I lost quite a bit of weight following that method, and I am quite sedentaryIt will probably take a couple of weeks to get the hang of it, but stick with it for two months and see then what you think."
1156,"7 EASY Ways to Make Money at Home (2018)I'm just gonna be breaking down some different ways that anyone could make money even if they only have really basic skills.NOW THE FIRST WAY THAT YOU CAN MAKE MONEY FROM HOME IS TO START A YOUTUBE CHANNEL.I know that if you don't have a YouTube channel you might have a couple questions about this :how much money can you really make from a YouTube channel and isn't it pretty much a gamble whether or not your channel is successful ?So let me address that second question :First yes it is a gamble whether or not your channel becomes really successful but I truly believe that by consistently postinggood quality content anyone can attract several thousand subscribers.So there's no guarantees that you're going to become super famous or have a million subscribers or become the next PewDiePie but by consistently posting good quality interesting content you will slowly attract more and more people and be able to make more and more money with your YouTube channel.And then as for wondering how much money a YouTube channel actually makes I've been making about 1,500 to 2,000 dollarsevery month since my channel was at about 15,000 subscribers. I'm now at about 50,000 subscribers so I'm making a fair amount more than that. But I just want you to understand that even if you only have 10 or 15 or 20 000 subscribers which is totally attainable you can make pretty good money with a minimal amount of effort.THEN THE SECOND EASY WAY TO MAKE MONEY FROM HOME IS TO DO FREELANCE WRITING WORK.Two of my favorites are Upwork, the world's largest online workplace and www.hirewriters.com probably the most popular freelance website on the internet.So there are thousands of jobs posted on these websites on a very regular basis from people who are interested in hiring people at alldifferent skill levels and at all different price ranges.And then hire writers comm is obviously a much more niche. It's only for people who are interested in hiring freelance writersand there are different skill levels that you can test into. And then depending on what skill level you're at you'll be paid a different amount for each writing assignment that you complete.THE THIRD EASY WAY THAT YOU CAN MAKE MONEY FROM HOME IS BY SELLING PHOTOGRAPHS THAT YOU TAKE ON TO STOCK PHOTO WEBSITES.Now obviously there's a million photographers out there and if you try to become a photographer in your city you might have trouble marketing your services depending on how big of a city you live in. But even though there are many photographers out there there are also many people out there who are looking for unique high-quality stock photos and there seems to be an insatiable demand for such content sites like Adobe stock.And as your skills as a photographer increase and your images become better and better quality you'll be able to sell your image for more and more money.IDEA NUMBER FOUR FOR HOW YOU CAN MAKE MONEY FROM HOME IS SOMETHING THAT YOU CAN DO CURLS UP IN YOUR BED WITHOUT EVER HAVING TO GET OUT. THAT IS TO TEST WEBSITES FOR OTHER BUSINESSES.So obviously there's a million websites online. People make these websites but then the problem is that a lot of the time over time links break, things get formatted wrong, things don't work, and it's tedious for the company to spend their resources trying to go through the entire website and test things.And also they want an objective outside perspective but they can't just ask their customers to do that. So instead there are services that help connect basically freelancers who are willing to test the websites.One of the most popular websites that connects people like this is called www.usertesting.com .It pays people about $30 per hour to test websites.JOB NUMBER FIVE IS ANOTHER TYPE OF FREELANCE WORK BUT IT'S A VERY DIFFERENT ONE AND THAT IS TO BE A SOCIAL MEDIA MANAGER.Now obviously there's tons of differe..."

1159,"I love that I was asked to answer this. Let it be known that I speak for all women when I say:I have no idea.Which is to say, from one woman to the next, there is absolutely no way to predict preference for such things by gender (though I suppose I'd predict more enthusiasm for said cock ring among the heavily tattooed/gauged/pierced crowd). But such prejudgments are by no means a certainty, either.Here's the thing: the cock ring preference, unless discussed, is likely not to be a determinant factor in a woman ""liking"" the man, because I would imagine it's gonna be one of the last things you learn about him in the courtship process. Like, ""Bam, dick in your face—and oh, huh, a cock ring.""So a woman might like or dislike a man for many, many reasons, but unless you discuss the cock ring, it's not going to be a factor until it is. At which point, you have, I would suppose, a 50-50 chance at best, because the question is pretty binary.I recommend asking.My work here is done. Now I can just sit back and wait for all my prospective clients to pull this answer up out of Google search results. <pours self a whiskey>."

1161,"When my daughter was 16 she had a best friend named Coral. I didn’t particularly like Coral; she had a bad attitude and a potty mouth.At 4 AM one morning our doorbell rang. Outside there’s a sheriff’s deputy and my daughter. Before I can say anything the cop says “Good morning, Mr. Thomase, your daughter is not in any trouble with the law but I think it’s best if she tells you the story. Have a nice day.”The cop leaves and I look at my daughter. Like I said, she’s 16. I just say, “This better be good.”Here’s what happened. My daughter and a bunch of her friends were coming home from a party in Denver. Coral was driving, in the process of dropping people off at their houses in semi-rural eastern Boulder County. At some point Coral says “I have to pee, I’ve been holding it for half an hour now.” She stops the car and runs off into some bushes at the side of the road.At that precise moment a sheriff’s deputy comes by and decides to investigate the stopped car at the side of the road. He walks up to the driver’s side window, but of course, there’s no driver. “Where’s the driver of this vehicle?” he asks, and the kid in the front passenger seat points off into the bushes.The cop pulls out his flashlight and heads into the bushes. Naturally, he catches Coral with her panties around her ankles. The cop is embarrassed. Coral screams.At that point I am sure that the cop wanted nothing more to do with the situation. Let them off with a warning or whatever. But no, Coral has to make an issue of it. She starts cussing out the cop. She won’t stop. Everyone in the car is telling Coral to just shut up. But she doesn’t. Finally, somewhere in her tirade she says “ . . . and you’re treating me like some kind of a criminal, like we’ve got drugs or something. If you think we’re so f—-ing bad, why don’t you search the f——ing car.”Permission given. Cop says, “OK, that’s it, everyone out of the car.” My daughter says she and her six friends then had to stand at the side of the road while several other sheriff’s cars including a K-9 unit showed up and searched every inch of the car. The process took hours.In the meantime the kids are starting to sweat. Miraculously, though, the cops find nothing, but decide it’s best if each kid gets escorted home by an officer.Moral of the story: never ever mouth off to a cop. Even if you’ve done nothing wrong, he can make you pay for your attitude."

1164,"What works for chronic pain is very individual. There are so many factors that it's pretty much a matter of trying things until you find what works for you. For example, John Tracy found that lifting weights helps him. For me, weightlifting increases my pain.  That being said, here are a few of the things that have worked for me, or for people I know.Stress reduction techniques: Stress increases pain levels. Anything you can do that reduces your stress will minimize this effect.Exercise: Exercise is a very important component of a pain management program, but it MUST be carefully managed. If you have a bad back, weighlifting may not be an option, but you may be able to walk. If you have fibromyalgia or arthritis, yoga might aggravate your symptoms, but exercising in a warm pool or doing Tai Chi may work for you. Even if you're in so much pain that you spend most of your time in bed, there are simple stretches you can do to keep your muscles toned.Meditation: There are quite a few studies that show meditation makes coping with chronic pain easier. There are tons of really good guided meditations available on YouTube that can help you get started.Herbs, supplements, and essential oils: There are many herbs and essential oils that can help ease pain, discovering which ones may be helpful for you takes research and experimentation. It all depends on what causes your pain, and your own physical reactions. Many vitamin and mineral deficiencies can cause various kinds of pain, as can hormones that are out of balance. Appropriate supplementation will help with this, but must be handled carefully because too much can be just as much of a problem as too little. You have to be especially careful with herbs, supplements and essential oils because many of them can interact with each other or prescription medications, or cause side effects. I highly recommend that you only use these under the supervision of an expert such as an herbalist, aromatherapist, and/or holistic or naturopathic physician.Hydrotherapy: Epsom salt baths, herbal baths, etc can ease pain and help you feel better. Some people advocate very hot baths, others advocate cold ones - what works the best is what works for you. For me, a comfortable temperature works best. anything less than body temperature makes my pain worse, and very hot water eases the pain but causes other issues. Whirlpool baths are also a good option, and saunas or steam rooms can also be helpful if you can tolerate the temperatures.Effective pain management requires work on your part. It's much more complicated than simply going to the doctor and getting shots or pills.Disclaimer: Nothing in this post is intended as medical advice. Before trying any of these options, you should discuss them with a qualified practitioner."
1165,"This is a technique known as 'shadowing' that I learnt in Japanese class, which I find tremendously helpful for short-term oral fluency improvement.Watch your favorite English language TV show or movie, and as the characters speak, repeat loudly the exact words they are saying the moment you hear them. In other words, 'shadow' their dialogue in real-time. Don't worry about getting every word or sound right - focus on listening carefully, moving along quickly and keeping pace. After the movie ends, repeat the exact same movie and do it again. And again.By forcing yourself to speak at native speed, your brain becomes hyper-receptive to what you are hearing, and you will find yourself not only picking up the words quicker and quicker, but also unconsciously mimicking the inflections and vocal nuances that are usually difficult to learn for a non-native. It will also fix the stammer that comes with uncertainty or lack of confidence. In this way, the actors in the movie become your speaking partners.This will be perfect practice just before your interview. Look for some interview practice videos on YouTube, then shadow the entire conversation. Practice the same dialogs again and again. You will be amazed how that will improve not only your speaking, but also your ability to actively listen and react. Best of luck."

1167,"I do not think Muslims hate him.1.) Let's take an example, BJP it self got 57/80 in Loksabha elections. UP contains 18.5% of Muslim population. It is obvious that majority of Muslims must have voted him during LS Elections' 2014.2.) Also in J&K Muslims have majority and there BJP got 25/87 Seats. Hence it is now clear that Muslims also like Mr. Narendra Modi.3.) A 12-year-old Muslim girl, studying in Class 6 of a Mira Road school in Mumbai, secured the first place in a Bhagwad Gita competition organised by the International Society for Krishna Consciousness (ISKCON). courtesy: The Hindu3.) Also Prime Minister Narendra Modi praised Islam for emphasizing the importance of education.""The Quran mentions the word 'ilm' 800 times. It is among the most repeated words after Allah. This is the importance of knowledge in the religion,"" Modi told an audience comprising the high commissioners of Saarc countries and envoys of Muslim.4.) A 34 year old guy named Imran Khan of Alwar district in Rajasthan was recently praised by NaMo in Wembley stadium London during his speech.PS: On a serious note till date, Mr Khan has developed 52 educational apps which he has dedicated to the students for free. The most popular among them, the general science app in Hindi has over 500,000 downloads and 18 million screen views. But for the Sanskit teacher, money is not important.This is how Muslims are contributing equally in making our nation proud. Salute to this enthusiasm from Mr. Khan.5.) Often several Muslims leaders meet with Mr. Modi in New Delhi.I think these are the examples that Every Indian should praise.Last but not the least as far as the hatred is concerned Please never spread rumors about this Hindu-Muslim thing both the religions are perfect in their own ideologies. Let's stop pointing flaws in one another. The day we stop interfering in each other's business. This nation will automatically touch apex.Come let's make INDIA a strong very strong nation.

1168,"What are some benefits of being close friends with a lawyer?The implication in your question is that there is some benefit to be close friends with a particular professional more than just the pleasure of friendship.Guess what Charlie, that’s patently offensive.I am not at your beck and call to give free legal advice. I make a point of not discussing business with my friends. The ethics rules prohibit me from giving advice outside an attorney client relationship so the best you will get is an earnest recommendation to talk to your lawyer before you do something.Next, why don’t you ask about the benefits of being a close friend with a doctor or an engineer? Between the two of them , perhaps they will give you a freebie on how to fix your cranial coccygeal fusion."

1171,"One of my more remarkable clients told me she was from another planet. I had been prepared for this possibility by a reading I gave someone twenty years before. I had assumed this talk about aliens visiting Earth came from the lunatic fringe until I channeled this early reading. After that I was more open-minded.I have worked in two psychiatric hospitals so I know what crazy looks like. The woman telling me she was an alien was not crazy. She set off no intuitive alarms.I shook her hand, surprising her with my ready acceptance, and told her I was delighted to finally meet an alien. She went on to tell me she was here to invent a medical device and bragged about her psychic abilities. Aliens are very psychic. The reason for her sudden urge to get a reading had to do with her pride. Her particular race is egotistical. My believing her instead of being blown away pricked her ego. Maybe these primitive humans aren’t so primitive was her lesson.I was to have this happen a few more times. I was not looking for aliens, in every case the client spontaneously told me they were from offplanet. When a client comes in I cannot tell just by looking at them if they are an alien. Perhaps they were open with me because they sense I am sympathetic to their plight.While the first woman I met was upfront about her origins in most cases the aliens are either uncertain about who they are or are tentative about admitting their suspicions. I have talked with one other who was bold, even brash, having no doubt what he was. Some will have a human companion who helps them get along on this strange and unpleasant planet. Others don’t need help. In all cases they are here to help.My experience with this client led me to begin psychically explore these other civilizations. The revelations were eye popping. We are under the protection of benign alien civilizations. They are here to help.The particular civilization the woman is from occupies several planets. They have a special interest in health and have the technology to help. They have a long history with genetic manipulation in order to perfect their bodies and to repress their aggressive tendencies. You could say it’s their thing.Aliens I have dealt with know they are not of this planet. They are invariably positive and respectful. Their technology is light years ahead of ours and they have solved the problem of faster than light travel. Their home planets have societies that are supportive of the individual. Their economies are cashless and communistic. There is no such thing as want, war, racism, or boredom. Technology has freed them from the necessity of work so they are able to dedicate themselves to what truly interests them.I have spotted several aliens in the news. They have some things in common.They are invariably strong family people. If they discuss their work they frame it in terms of helping people. Profits or the company structure do not enter the conversation. They discuss how they can contribute to the greater whole, not who they are or what they have. They are creative coming up with completely new ideas or vastly improving current technology. They will sometimes give away their technology to help the society at large.Nikola Tesla, the inventor who died in 1943, was an alien who revolutionized the electrical industry. His inventions were used by Westinghouse more than a hundred years ago and are the mainstay of our modern electrical distribution system. Without his inventions it would be very difficult to distribute electricity over long distances because Edison’s designs were inadequate to the needs of modern society. Tesla was a brilliant eccentric who spoke eight languages. In general he did not function well in society and did not try to profit from his inventions.Newton is another early alien who passed in 1727. He was one of the pioneers preparing Earth for the “Alien Invasion”. His theoretical work revolutionized our view of the Universe. He invented the first practical reflecting telescope, determined the speed of sound, gave us calculus, discovered the color spectrum, and much more.I once saw a young girl on television. She was seven. She had cured her father’s diabetes with diet. She had performed the necessary research herself. She was enthusiastic, self-confident, assertive, and seemingly egoless as she discussed how she did it. She was an alien.Aliens are everywhere. They are in Congress, the environmental movement, religious institutions, education. They are here to enhance our technological development, medicine, and our institutions. Their only purpose is to heal the planet and to save us from ourselves. They don’t always fit in and sometimes have problems functioning in our harsh culture. They are from civilizations that are very different from our. Their societies function on a much higher plane of service. Their sense of community is strong.The environmental movement is especially important for them because the planet has been crippled by our heedless exploitation. To an alien the planet is a living, intelligent organism. Consequently the reinvigorated environmental movement has permitted the planet to recover much that was lost by the 1970’s. Like all living entities Earth responds to love."
1172,"Flight Attendant to the rescue!Here are some tips I give out for free to my friends as they so often ask me ""what really gets on your nerves?""Boarding: should you need to have your neck pillow, eye shades, books, ear plugs, ear phones, laptops, vanity kits, etc., etc... please do so when everyone has settled down in their seats and not while there's a long queue of passengers trying to get to their seats as well. You’re blocking the aisle and impeding the boarding process is not cool. Better yet, do it before you get into the cabin. Take out whatever you need first so you won't be blindly rummaging through your bags for your stuff.Boarding: don't get aggressive with the crewmembers. Should you have a problem, ask politely. Boarding is the peak time where everyone is doing way too many things at one go. We're liaising not just with you but with multiple, other personnel: ground staff, cockpit crews, in-flight catering, engineering, etc., etc. Everyone's fuse is short here, and since the door isn't closed yet, remember it's easier for us to call the enforcement officers and offload any, um, troublesome passengers.Cruising: don't block the aisle. The aisle needs to be clear of any obstructions at all times, to prevent any unforeseen injuries. Someone else could trip on your legs or bags and fall down. I've tended to these types of injuries before, where a passenger trips over someone's bag, falls down, and hits the arm rest squarely on their mouth.Cruising: don't do anything immoral, please. Mile High Club? Pffft. An aircraft is not your private bedroom. Getting too boozy, too drunk, or too whatever and insulting others is also not cute. You'll be welcomed by law enforcement officers once we touch down.Landing: sir, I know you have to be somewhere. I know you need to be somewhere. I know you can see the seatbelt sign is still on. So why do you get up before it's off? I know you're eager to exit the aircraft--me too (especially if this is my last sector), but were I to have an injured passenger on board their health would be in jeopardy now because this other passenger refuses to obey the regulations and instead chooses to be selfish. What if the captain brakes suddenly while taxiing down the runway? You'll be thrown (or jerked) forward. This is not ideal for me either, as it's close to midnight and I need to go home, too. Please be seated and we can all be on our way once the captain says the magic words you are dying to have repeated from the pre-landing check: ""cabin crew, disarm all doors and cross check."""

1174,"How do I reset my Gmail password when I don't remember my recovery information?Sad fact: You CAN’T.Unsurprisingly, Google has very solid account security. Among the finest in the world, in fact. If you have lost or forgotten your Google/Gmail password, or if your account was hacked, you have exactly one way to get back into that account. The automated process that starts here:https://accounts.google.com/sign...That’s IT.Really!I’ve answered variations on this other times and places, and added a lot of other detail. But it all adds up to the same thing.If you have a G Suite account thru a business or school, you can call your Administrator. If you own a G Suite hosted domain (cheaper and easier than you think, and worth doing) or if you are an Admin on a domain, then you can call tech support at Google, directly. They’re available 24/7, and trust me, they are good.But with a free Gmail account, if you get locked out, you absolutely cannot contact a human being at Google about it. You can’t call, text, email, snail mail, carrier pigeon or pony express them.Sorry. No.UPDATE, 10/17/2018. There is a new product, Google One. It offers additional account storage - and tech support, for gmail addresses, including live phone support. Which of course made me VERY curious if this could be used to unlock accounts. So being as I already pay for additional storage and was therefore automatically enrolled in Google One, I filled in the little form, and had them call me.And the answer is… NO. The tech support folks you can reach with the Google One service do indeed work for Google. But they do not (and cannot!) offer any assistance for locked out accounts, other than to walk you thru the automated process. If that process fails to get you in - you lost the account.Side issue: The reason there are so many collapsed answers here is because there are a ton of scammers out there who want you to call them, and they work hard to get their links into Quora answers. They will also use every trick there is to convince you they are somehow affiliated with or sanctioned by Google. They aren’t. They can only use the same automated process I linked above - and charge you good money for doing something you can do yourself.Again, there is only one way to recover a free Gmail/Google account.https://accounts.google.com/sign...If you can’t get in using that process, you lost the account. Forever.So the best advice I can give you is to carefully go thru the Security Checkup process on your Google Account page, here: https://myaccount.google.comYou can set up a recovery phone number and email address. I STRONGLY suggest you use both, and make the recovery email address one that belongs to a close family member or trustworthy friend. NOT one of your own, that you may forget or lose!Also set up 2-Step Verification, using every possible safety option, including printing your recovery codes and stashing them in several places. Used properly, 2 Step can and will prevent your account getting hacked."
1175,"There have been many people. especially young children,  who had memories of past lives that were checked out by being taken to places they remembered.  Most religions believe in afterlife of some sort.

There is no hard scientific way to prove either way."

Then the company who is hiring you will file a working visa for you.Now, is it easy to get a job for Indian Engineer to get a job there? No. It's not. If somebody is telling you that it is easy then they are undermining two things:They are undermining the efforts of the existing Indian Engineers or others who worked their ass off to study hard in their college and school to get good grades which are one of the factors in hiring an individual; and worked hard to in the interviews to beat the competition which could have been present in Sweden/Denmark.They are undermining the hiring process of the organizations who need the best talent but according to this person these companies are hiring somebody who is from a country from where there is massive migration to other countries primarily in the tech sector.Sweden/Denmark has very high standards of living and obviously the employment sector is very competitive. I know many great talents who are still working in India and China but are not good enough to deserve a job here. Nothing is for granted. Please stop talking to people who say that it is easy to get a job in Sweden/Denmark. They are challenged and need help.My recommendation is to shine your resume to the standards of these countries, acquire skills they seek and get connected with people who are working their in your domain of work by connecting them on LinkedIn, Quora and other credible social media sites.Hope it helps. All the best! Thanks for the A2A."
1178,"You need the help of Jonjhua. And ask ""Jonjhua true nature of reality?""What is Jonjhua?Allow me to explain...To figure out the true nature of reality, we are limited by the tools and apparatus available to us. This includes our sensory experience and our ability to reason or imagine. Any proof must ultimately use either our sensory experience or our mental faculties. Also, we will have to use language to answer the question. So, let's see how well we do on figuring out ""reality"" on a day-to-day basis.What we normally refer to as our experience of the world (sensory) is actually a set of events that have already been significantly transformed (corrupted) with respect to the world and bears only a shadowy resemblance to the real world.What we see is just a narrow band of the electromagnetic spectrum. Photons of wavelength between 400 to 700 nanometers strike receptors in the retina of the eye. All wavelengths below and above this are undetected and unexperienced by us directly. The photons between 400 to 700 nm are detected by our receptors and create an impulse which travels through the optic nerve passing through larger complex structures (eg. distinct nerves, lateral geniculate bodies, hypothalmus etc.) and leading to the occipital lobes. At each of these stages mapping through neurological processes changes or adds on to the data stream that serves as the initial input to the receptor.(Simple translation: What we see is not what is really out there, but a version of it corrupted by our own receiving antennae)John Grinder, in 'Whispering in the wind' says -The image we see of what we take to be in front of us is actually behind us on our occipital lobes. We ""know"" that that occipital lobe image corresponds to some event in front of us through learning and especially the multiple descriptions of the our experience of the world that we create through a comparison of the products of the neurological transforms that define the individual sensory modalities - in particular touch and audition. The sound we hear emanating from behind us is an event that is actually occurring on our temporal lobe - but we have learned as in the case of vision through coordination with the other modalities and in particular by arrival time differentials as refined as 1/250,000 of a second between the two ears where in the space around us the source of the sound is located. Again similar descriptions are available for the other sensory channels.Case in point - Stainless Steel. Stainless Steel is made 'stainless' by a thin film created when chromium, oxygen (from air and water) react with iron, chromium, manganese, silicon, carbon etc. This thin film is invisible and preventsadditional corrosion by acting as a barrier that limits the access of oxygen and water to the underlying metal surface.What this means is - that stainless steel does not corrode - because it is already corroded. Since, we can't see the new film - it looks ""stainless"" to us.Similar sequences of corruption of each sensory channel can be described. What we hear is within a limited bandwidth. What we feel is too. What we smell is again inhibited. And so is what we can taste.We can't hear dog whistles.We see stars which are probably long dead.A dog can smell what we can't.What we experience is not reality. What we experience is a shadow of reality - mutilated, corrupted, modified, added on,Changed beyond recognition (?) by our own neurological receptors.In his book, Grinder gives a beautiful description of this distinction -You are likely sitting in a comfortable chair holding this book in your hands as you read these words. You are sensing a vast number of things; most of them occur without your being aware of them; some force their way into your consciousness. We invite you to back out of your present perceptual position for a moment and look at ..."

1182,"(I have created a percentile calculator updated every year (updated to CAT 2015) that can be accessed publicly. You just need to enter your credentials and it will tell you the percentile you need to get a call : Percentile Calculator. An NA implies that it is not possible to get a call, unless you're in the top 50 of your stream. Please note that these will give you a ballpark estimate, as they are based on historical data. Just download the file using save as and enter your credentials to know what you need to score)For starters, the various shortlisting criteria are available online for IIM Ahmedabad, IIM Bangalore and IIM Calcutta.Every institute has these shortlisting criteria for which they select candidates for interviews. Every institute has a minimum application score you must clear to make it to the interview shortlist.The institute that you graduate from also no bearing, except the scaling that the IIM's do with the CGPA. Most good institutes have their CGPA's unchanged, some are scaled down/up marginally.IIM Ahmedabad:The application rating cutoff this year for candidates who were not stream toppers** was 0.72. The application rating consists of a scaled maximum of 0.3 from pre CAT (10th, 12th, Undergrad) and a scaled maximum of 0.7 from the CAT (refer to application rating). So your pre CAT application score would be 40.5 (exactly as much as mine) and your scaled contribution to the application rating would be 0.27, leaving 0.72-0.27 = 0.45 for the CAT to cover. (0.45/0.7)*450 = 289.3 ~ 290 to be on the safe side. This would come to be a percentile of 99.5 to get an interview call assuming you are a not a stream topper.**From this year, IIM A has tweaked their PI shortlisting to be more inclusive. As mentioned in their application rating, you can get a call if you are amongst the top 50 of your background. Here, the application rating cut-off isn't considered and you are given a direct interview call. If you aren't in the top 50, you must clear the application rating.IIM BangaloreI wasn't able to find an online version of their PI/WAT shortlist cut-off criteria, but because they include work experience and have a good amount of weightage to their pre CAT I personally do not know anyone below a 99.75 who got a call with these credentials (assuming you are a fresher). I am also aware that they are very strongly inclined to high acads for graduation. (An important point has been pointed out by Aditya in the comments)IIM CalcuttaAn important thing to note is that they do not take your CGPA into consideration (woot for everyone who screwed up theirs!).IIM Calcutta had its cutoff as 69.96. Taking in your credentials and assuming you are a male candidate you would need 69.96 - 20 = 49.96 (out of 77) of the CAT Score which works out to 292/450 which would be 99.62 percentile. (Refer to the application rating). The cutoff is also present hereMy 0.02$ : Score as much as you can. Being in the 'safe zone' never works. Work hard. Score well. A very high percentile will open all interview doors to you. And the interview is really important."

Shall we?Visit Google and search for your keyword.Write down that keyword and the suggested keywords on a Notepad or your favorite text editor. Microsoft Word works. I use Sublime Text 3.If you want more suggestions, visit Free keyword research tool and Keyword Tool: 750+ Google Keyword Suggestions for Free. Use 192 Google Domains & 83 Languages.Step 2: Figure out the keyword’s search volume and ranking difficulty.Search volume and ranking difficulty are known as Key Performance Indicators (KPI). The higher the search volume the more traffic your web page will likely to receive. The lower the ranking difficulty, the lower the competition, the higher the chance to rank on the top 10 results of Google’s search results.Since we are trying to get on the first page of Google, let’s use Google Adwords to see traffic we anticipate to get and how difficult to rank for a chosen keyword.Visit Google Adwords Keyword Planner: https://adwords.google.com/ko/Ke...Enter all keywords in the keyword planner and hit “Get Ideas”Chose the most searched for keywords with Low-to-Medium competition.In my case, I choose to rank for “how to get my website on Google first page”.Step 3: Find the top 20 competitors.Once you have chosen which keyword you want to rank for, go back to Google and search for that keyword. Then write down the URLs for all of the top 1 and 2 pages of Google.Visit GoogleSearch for your chosen keywordVisit the top 20 websites on Google, copy and paste those 20 website addresses into your favorite text editor.Now you should have your top 20 competitors and their website URLs or webpages rank for that same keyword as yours.Step 4: Spy on Competitors.Now that you know your competitors, you want to know what every competitor is doing to rank on top pages of Google. That usually means you have to read all 20 web pages of your competitors, understand and analyze what they wrote about. When you do so, you will notice some similarities in thei..."
1185,"Rather than giving you a boring step by step process of learning Python, I would share my personal journey about how I started learning Python.Here is my personal learning experience:What motivated me to start learn Python ?I fell in love with Python after reading a bunch of answers on Quora about how people were doing wonderful things with Python.Some were writing scripts to automate their Whats app messages.Some wrote a script to download their favourite songs,while some built a system to receive cricket score updates on their phones.All of this seemed very excited to me and I finally decided that I would love to learn Python.How I started learning Python ?I started learning Python form The Complete Python Masterclass: Learn Python From Scratch as it was the recommended course for beginners.I found the course to be really interesting yet simple for beginners like me.However, if you are a professional programmer then I would recommend you to learn from the official docs : 3.7.2 DocumentationHow much time it took to learn ?Topic: Python basics, control structures, functions.Time : - 1 Week.Learning experience:Learning Python basics is a piece of cake, it is extremely simple to get up and running with Python. Basics like variables, operators and control structures are extremely easy to learn as opposed to other languages like Java.Topic: OOP & Regular ExpressionsTime: 1 Week.Learning Experience:This section was a bit tough as I didn’t had a clear understanding of OOP principles. I had used OOP in Java but still was not clear about the concept but eventually with some practice I was able to understand OOP in Python, the self keyword and the init method.If you are a beginner then I would recommend you to focus on this section as it is widely used while making complex applications.You might not understand a lot of things at first, but give things time to sink in and it will make sense.Topic: TkinterTime: 1 WeekLearning experience:This was the most exciting as I finally learned how to build desktop GUI applications using Python. Learned about the Tkinter library which allowed us to build interactive GUI with Python. It felt as if everything I have learned till now started making sense. When I was finally complete with this section, I was able to build my very own calculator.Here is a screenshot of what I built:Topic:Data AnalysisTime: 1 WeekLearning experience:Learned about the Numpy and Pandas library which are extensively used to perform data analysis with Python. If you aspire to be a data analyst/ data scientist I say you focus on learning the basics well. I also learned how to read data from an excel/ CSV file and visualise the same data on a chart. In the process, I also learned about Jupyter notebooks which is an excellent IDE for data visualisation with Python.Here is a screenshot of me plotting some graphs:Topic: DjangoTime: 2 WeeksLearning experience:This was by far the most difficult topics I had ever learned. I had no previous experience learning anything related to server side web development and hence it took me a while to understand terminologies like authentication, URL routing, API and models.I had initially given up on this section as it felt very complex but I took my time and worked my way through it with patience. I took notes on pen and paper and made sure that I understand every line of code even before I use it.Eventually the efforts paid off and I finally started to understand what Django really is and how it works.It took me 2 weeks to get done with the Django basics and a lot more practice to finally complete a Django project on my own.I built my own todo app and a simple book store site using Django and a little bit of Bootstrap.Here is a screenshot of the bookstore I built:Topic: Flask & Web CrawlerTime: 2 Weeks.Flask was a piece of cake after learning Django as Flask is just a micro framework.I didn’t..."
1186,"He will stare at you. I repeat, HE WILL STARE AT YOU. Literally every single relationship I’ve been in has started with a boy staring at me.If he has your number, he will randomly text you just to see how you're doing.his pupils will dilate while speaking to you. This is a scientifically proven fact. I tested it and it’s true.The first thing he’ll look for in every situation is you. Watch him when he walks in the room. If he stops looking around when he finds you, then chances are, he likes you.He will smile when you smile, even if he’s all the way across the room and just happened to notice. Guys love girls' smiles so when he sees you smile he most likely will too.This seems really obvious, but pay attention to how he treats other girls, if he treats you differently, then he probably likes you.He will be extra interested in the other boys you talk to. He may ask if you're friends, or how long you’ve known them, or simply just comment on them.He will slow his walking pace to match yours. This is just another scientific fact that I tested, and it works.Don’t make a big deal out of this one because most guys do it anyway, but he may sit with his legs apart often because it makes him appear more manly. No explanation needed.When he talks to you he will tilt his head slightly. I don’t know why guys do this but when ever a guy is actually paying attention to what you're saying, he tilts his head.Even though he will listen to what you have to say, he will also talk about himself A LOT. He wants to show you all his accomplishments to prove he’s worthy of you.He will remember a lot of the tiny details you randomly throw into conversations sometimes. For example, my bf somehow remembered that I hate orange flavored dark chocolate lol.This one is only true for like 80% of guys, but he will often fix his appearance when he’s with you.(Touching/fixing hair, ajusting clothing, actually bothering to tie shoes).If you ask him who he likes, and he replies asking you who YOU like, then there’s a pretty good chance he likes you, unless he’s someone who struggles with trust.He will give into the things you want to do. Like instead of watching football( lots of guys find this very important I really don’t know why), he’ll decide to go to a concert with you or something. Or it could be super low key, like instead of playing soccer, he’ll play volleyball with you or something.This goes along with #15, but he will not be able to say no to you 99% of the time , like my bf did NOT want to join choir, and yet I asked him to join, and he said he would try it.He will use a wider variety of facial expressions with you than he does with other people. I don’t even know why this is, it just is.Repetitive lip action. If he’s biting or licking his lips a lot when he’s around you, there’s a chance that he’s thinking about ahhh… doing other things with you other than talking."
1187,"As we’ve had the chance to interview for several positions at Novorésumé, and I have been on both sides of the table now both as an interviewer and interviewee, through both perspectives, I’ve learned that the job interview is not, and should not, be one-sided. It’s really like going on a first date.The purpose of an interview isn’t only to put the candidate on the hot-seat. Yes, the pressure to perform falls unequally on the person seeking a job, but, ultimately, it’s an opportunity for both sides to learn from one another. As a candidate, this means you should be ready to both answer questions and ask them.Less obvious are the types of questions you should ask. Here it’s important to remember the three goals you should have for the interview:Demonstrate your interest in the role and the company.Persuade the potential employer that you have the skills and experience they seek.Identify if the job and the organization is the right fit for you.The best questions to ask an interviewer are:Have I answered all your questions, or is there something you’d like me to clarify?Do you have any hesitations about my qualifications?What do you like most about working here?”What new skills can I hope to learn here?What is the next step in the process?Who would I be working closest with, or reporting to, on a daily basis?Beyond some of the hard skills we’ve discussed, which soft skills would be most helpful in this position?Can you tell me if I would get the chance to be involved with this (project/initiative/etc.)?What are your expectations for this role during the first 30 days, 90 days, year?Could you describe for me the culture of the company?Where do you think the company will be in 5 years?Who do you consider your top competitor? And why?What are the main opportunities (or challenges) that the company/department has at the moment?What is the typical career path for this role in this company?If you are interested in the explanation of why these questions are smart to ask, you can read the following guide about mastering your next job interview."

1189,"You won’t make enough money selling 3D printed parts and pieces. Trust me… it’s not worth your time.You should look at it from a different angle if you want to make the most amount of money off of your 3d printer.Think of your 3D printer as a resource that will help you make money, not as a machine that produced something worth money.You can make a lot of money teaching classes in your community. When I was in college I taught 3D printing classes to local community members. A 1.5-hour class cost $15 per person with a cap of 8 people per class. You do the math… it’s a nice chunk of money for an hour and half of work. Especially after you create an initial lesson plan and re-use it for more classes.If you want to take it even a step further… then consider recording a 3D printing-related class for an online marketplace such as Udemy. You could teach people not only how to use a 3D printer, but how to set up their file for success, and maybe even design a few basic files. After you spend a few weeks doing the initial recordings you are sitting with a money-making machine. As long as you spend a bit of time marketing it right you will get a nice monthly check from Udemy."

1191,"Quora might hope that you use Quora for all knowledge searches.I would suggest you use Google when you are seeking information and Quora when you are seeking explanation.Whether it is bad depends on perspective.  Quora wants to own a database with all of the world's knowledge so they can convert that into a boatload of money.  So, of course they welcome people asking those simple questions.  I think it can be bad from the perspective of the users.  It clutters the feed with crap.  I expect my feed to be filled with content that will be interesting to read, not simplistic factoids that can be found anywhere.  Encouraging easy questions on Quora makes Quora a less enjoyable place for me.I don't understand why people do it.  It just doesn't make any kind of sense to me.  Why would someone come to Quora, click on add question, type their question, click through all of the prompts about topics and being sure the question hasn't already been asked and then wait a few hours for the question to make it into the feed of someone willing to answer it, when they could just type the question in their browser search bar and get an immediate answer from Google?There are some questions that Google can handle much better than Quora can.  It can provide a better, more concise, vetted answer and in an instant.  Quora should stick to specializing on what it does better than Google - provide direct contact with people that understand something, so a conversation can happen to bring that understanding to others.A year ago, there was an annoying series of questions each asking for the name of the actor that played a specific character in the 1970s-1980s television sitcom M*A*S*H.  One after another, the questions worked their way through the whole cast.  ""Who played Nurse Houlihan on MASH?"", ""Who played BJ Honeycutt on MASH?"", on through to  ""Who played Hawkeye Pierce on MASH?""Typing that into Google provides:What could a Quora member possibly provide that would improve on that answer?  No amount of expertise or experience will provide a more accurate or precise answer than Alan Alda.  No amount of literary flourish will make that answer more effective.  I used this example on one of the Quora Facebook groups and another member vigorously disagreed.  They said that you never know when one of the Quora members that comes across that simplistic question might actually have something to share, such as they grew up on the same street as Alan Alda and have a story to share.  And that, they said, was the justification to allow such basic questions on Quora.My view is - no.  If people want a story about Alan Alda, they should ask for it.  Maybe something like ""What are anecdotes about Alan Alda that Quora members can share?""It just makes no sense.  If someone is seeking stories about Alan Alda, they aren't going to type ""Who played Hawkeye Pierce on MASH?"" in the Quora search field.I want to see thoughtful questions in my feed so that I can read thoughtful answers and I can write thoughtful answers.  Question askers have as much responsibility to maintain quality on Quora as answerers do.  So, yes, I think it is bad to ask questions on Quora that could be easily answered on Google. It's your responsibility to ask better questions on Quora."

Wright's answer to Is Danish a hard language to learn?Hanseatic Low German also affected the phonology of Estonian. Since Tallinn (Reval) was one of the Hanseatic League’s major ports in the Baltic Sea, many lexical items were borrowed into Estonian. Estonian’s over-long vowels (and by analogy the over-long consonants) came into being due to contact with HLG, which has them as well."

1194,"Adrian Aoun gave a great high-level assessment of what it's like to work at Microsoft, including the struggles of a company so large and diverse. I'll just stick with my personal story.I interned in Redmond in the summer of 2009 (the trough of the Great Recession--great times). I interviewed for the XBox team for an SDE position, but ""Live Search"" made the offer for an SDET position. They told me that XBox had to reduce their hiring (including interns), but I was a little disappointed that they swapped my offer like that. Eventually I got over it: The economy sucked, and I should be grateful I even had a job.BingMy first day was the launch of Bing. I heard about it after orientation: I was joining a team in Bing, and that Bing was replacing Live Search.There were a ton of interns that summer as is the tradition at Microsoft, maybe several hundred. I was put in an office with two other interns on the floor above my team.My TeamI worked in Cosmos. It is the infrastructure team in Bing (or more formally, ""Online Services Division"") and managed Microsoft's version of Hive/Hadoop clusters, except instead of MapReduce and Hive it's Dryad and SCOPE (except you can run C# code) [1]. It was really cool technology, but unfortunately I hadn't taken an operating systems class yet so I couldn't fully appreciate it. It was used for offline processing of massive data like advertising impressions, index building, etc.My team was very diverse. Many accents and backgrounds were represented. Some, like my mentor, was brilliant (he used to work in the Visual Studio's compiler team). However, they were from different backgrounds than me--much older, with kids, and having worked at Microsoft for decades. I found it hard to relate. Some worked crazy long hours, while others left at 3 PM each day. Communication was hard because nearly every full timer had his/her own office, and everyone had his/her own schedules (and of course accents).Ramping UpIt was also hard to ramp up because the internal wikis weren't well-maintained, and there was no formal training for my team. I basically was not productive for nearly a week as I was setting up my machine (which unfortunately had hardware problems), reading Wiki pages and PDFs, and meeting new people. Plus, the internal tools we had to use were not very well-built.The Actual JobWe used Scrum, with fairly long sprints (multiple weeks). Yet, the job was slow. I spent a long time reading design documents to understand how the system worked, and what features needed work (or more testing). After that, I spent weeks writing a design document with complete test plans, meeting with various component owners to agree on things. It was a slow, tedious process where it took me weeks before I could open Visual Studio.Maybe I didn't have as much direction, or maybe I lacked experience, but even after I was in Visual Studio I didn't feel very productive. If I didn't understand something or needed help, I would have to walk downstairs, across the building, to find my team/mentor. Eventually, that became too tedious so I took my mentor's laptop and worked from there in his office. The work became too tedious to be fun. The design docs I relied on were not very readable, and the existing code was hard to understand. It originally came from MSR, they said--or so they tried to explain the code quality. I also wrote some visualization tools to better understand how Cosmos jobs were processed (what was done at each node, when, etc). But whenever I had to read or touch existing code, it was like walking in mud.I did not enjoy writing test systems, nor was I very good at it, especially for large distributed systems that I hadn't studied in depth before. I was a developer at heart. I knew throughout the summer that if I were returning, I would ask for a different role.Benefits and CompensationMicrosoft pays interns relatively well. I certainly wasn't expecting much--my only ""real"" prior job was working as a web developer for my university. I don't know about total compensation for full timers, but we got a housing subsidy, and if we elected, a car rental subsidy. (I opted for the bike subsidy). It paid for gym memberships (probably to make up for the free drinks). There were herds of Priuses ready to shuttle us from each building to another within a few minutes of a call. There were a few other benefits that I can recall, but free food was not one of them (in case you cared).Other ActivitiesThere was a large party for the Bing launch. Then there were many other events, for example for Windows. There were other events like department all-hands. Steve Ballmer was present at most of these events, usually speaking (No, I did not see Bill Gates at all). At one point, Steve waved at me as I awkwardly stared at him from the audience. I dutifully attended most of these events.There were many lecture series/tech talks by some of the most influential people at Microsoft for general employees that I attended, including ones about the compiler (and how they need to start thinking about optimizing for Atom), Azure, and many other things. I really enjoyed the unique opportunity to attend all of these. I learned a lot here from some of the most brilliant people in the industry.In addition to the tech talks, there were lots of classes. For example, for two weeks I attended half-day classes on testing. It wasn't particularly helpful, but it was cool that I had opportunities like that and other classes. My team also had classes on the Scrum process and one on idea generation that I attended with my team.As an intern, I could also participate in many intern-specific activities that were organized for us. I didn't go on the Mt. Rainier hike or skydiving, but there were awesome events like the summer intern celebration. Microsoft paid the cops to stop traffic on the road as a procession of two dozen busses full of interns crossed the 520 to the Pacific Science Center where we were treated to a fantastic dinner followed by a choice of Harry Potter or a laser show. We also each walked away with an XBox 360, which was a cool present.ConclusionI had access to many unique experiences that I feel were not available to full timers. Aside from interns, I felt a little out of place (generational difference), and wasn't so sure I belonged. It all felt a bit deceptive since I knew that life in Redmond full time would not be as rosy as life as an intern--even the weather in the summer masked the bitter realities of Washington weather during the other nine months!Yet the experience wasn't bad--part of how unproductive I felt had to do with my role and maintaining legacy code. If I didn't have to re-interview to switch to a different team and role, I probably would have just taken their return offer.But in hindsight, I'm glad I didn't because Facebook is better. Plus, Palo Alto has great weather all year round (not just summer)![1] http://research.microsoft.com/en..."

1197,"My hero. This woman had me when she was 15 years old. And instead of following a path many others did and living off of child support, and government assistance, she finished high school, and got a degree in accounting. By the time she was 20 years old, when most people her age were still drinking to the point of passing out, she was a partner yes partner, in an accounting firm. She was also a large shareholder on the first incarnation of GameStop. Sadly, she sold her shares in order to buy her first house. Only sadly because of she'd held on to it... Well. I'm a gamer. I'd have preferred her owning a third of GameStop than the house I grew up in, lol. All of that while taking care pretty much solo, of an obnoxiously inquisitive, attitudy little girl. She kicked my father out of the house when she was 21 because of his drinking problem and went full time solo-mother. Two years later she met my stepfather, who is basically awesome. They were not supposed to have any kids... And had five. My mom balances six children ranging in age from 27 to 8, has owned four businesses, three houses, achieved two degrees, and currently works two jobs. She  is helping her mother open a new company, as well as working on another company for the family. She is also an extremely ridiculous woman of God. My friends tend to avoid her if they are doing things they aren't supposed to be because she can read it on them like its tattooed on their foreheads. I'm 27 years old today. Been married six years in two weeks. My mother is still my ace. She is my hero, if I can be half the woman she's managed to be despite every obstacle thrown her way, I'll be something fantastic. Thanks for the ask to answer, and thanks for giving me an opportunity to actually write down all the things she's done. I'm going to have to call her right now to thank her for my birthday."
1198,"I will give a few reasons here:This is Manish Rawat (the one in blue, behind the Chinese athlete). He finished 13th in the 20 km walk event at Rio.The question was about medals and I’m giving the name of a person who stood 13th! You may wonder why? Here’s why.This guy from Uttarakhand, works two part time jobs and when he started his career in this sport he used to get the pension money of his father, 1,500 INR (25$) to survive with his family. For every single athlete, countries like US, UK, China and Japan spends thousands of dollars. But here in India, when a guy practices the event on his own, without much help from the government, he is laughed at. 20 km walk might be a funny sight for many because of the posture an athlete has to walk in. But they don’t understand the posture is like that because the feet have to be planted on the ground. It is not a duck walk. When Manish practiced on the streets of India, he was laughed and mocked at. When athletes from most of the countries who have opened there medal account in Rio, were practicing on tracks with high end shoes, this guy from India started his practice on the streets and roads with normal running shoes.No one (including me) had even heard his name until he achieved this feat. And even now, not many know his story because the main focus is how India hasn't won a single gold medal in 2016 Olympics. If you can take the focus out of the medals tally, please read his full story here: Beyond the medal race: The inspiring Manish Singh Rawat story that we almost missed2. Every single Indian knows her today. Yes, she is Dipa KarmakarShe won the same 1.25 billion hearts on the eve on our Independence day when she stood 4th in Vault gymnastics among the world’s best gymnasts. She performed the most dangerous ‘death’ vault, Produnova vault to achieve this glory ( What is the Produnova and why is it considered a dangerous vault? ). But has anyone given a thought, as to why she chose this vault (7.0 difficulty) and not any other vault which is not high risk but with a decent enough difficulty of 6.3 or 6.4? Because that’s how desperate she was to go to Olympics and represent India. Her coach and she knew with the amount of facilities and support provided by our Indian government for gymnasts, they couldn't qualify at the biggest stage for gymnastics. They had to take this risk. Even though death is possibility, gymnasts try this vault as it guarantees them seven points because of the difficulty level and even a little faulty execution gives them a chance at medal. Dipa did not come 4th because of the high class coaching, facilities, equipment, physios provided to her in India. She did this because she put her life at risk to achieve success and glory.When you see Indian media showing her videos of training, it is just sad to see the state of the equipment and facilities there. Think for yourself, would Dipa take up this risky vault if she was given the state of art facilities and equipment Simon Biles or Wang Yan received?3. Lalita Babar, who was the third Indian women athlete to enter a track events finals, stood 10th in her 3000 m steeplechase.She used to run half marathons earlier to earn the prize money offered by these marathons. Yes, she had a Russian coach for a brief period of time. But did we know her from before until she qualified for the finals? Did she get the training and facilities like her fellow runners from different parts of the world?4. Dutee Chand, who qualified for women’s 100m in Rio this year, stood 50th.This picture is of our 100m sprinter Dutee Chand, who was the first Indian woman to qualify for Olympics in this event. Yes, the same Dutee Chand, who our Sports Minister Vijay Goel, mistook as Srabani Nanda (Rio Olympics 2016: Vijay Goel messes up again, mistakes Dutee Chand for Srabani Nanda - Firstpost). How does our own Sports minister doesn't know who is taking part in Olympics this year? Her story is commendable though. In 2014, she was stuck with hyperandrogenism case. In short, the athletics world failed to recognise Chand as a female. Her family income was a mere 3,000 INR (50$) and it was very tough for her to fight her own case. She was embarrassed and scared to go out of her house. It was a lonely fight for her. But one day, in a landmark CAS judgement, her ability to compete as a female athlete was restored. She worked hard. Broke her own national record. In a similar case, South Africa’s Caster Semenya failed her gender test. But her country fought for her unlike India, whereas Dutee fought for her own dignity and dream all by herself!

1199,"You should look into a wine from Piedmont Italy called Brachetto d'Acqui. Brachetto d'Acqui is made from the Brachetto grape grown in the Acqui region of Italy (in Piedmont). This is the style of wine that Stella Rosa is attempting to mimic but usually falls short. Authentic Brachetto d'Acqui is slightly sparkling, medium sweet, red and oh so mesmerizing. The real stuff is absolutely beautiful. If you want to experience a world class version of Stella Rosa, this is the wine for you and Rosa Regale is a brand that is usually widely available and is the least expensive brand from this region. If you like Rosa Regale, there are dozens of even tastier (and more expensive) versions out there that become increasingly more decadent in depth, flavor and quality while maintaining the alluring soft sparkle and soft sweetness.You should also explore pre-made sangria. Although sangria is best when made using fresh ingredients, the pre-made sangria you can find in most supermarkets might be of interest to you.A step in the slightly less sweet category, but still has some sugar, would be a wine called Conundrum Red.A few wines to consider..."
1200,"A new computer is the better option, take the hard drive from the old one and transfer the data over and it will be identical, the only issue with it is that you likely have windows 7 and they will likely put windows 8.1 on the computer this is not an issue as in a few months if you have windows 7 you can get a free upgrade to windows 10The reason i say you should get a new computer instead of repair, is that  if your motherboard has had issues it likely caused issues with other components in your computer, an example of this is the capacitors on your motherboard stop delivering the right amount of power to your component and end up delivering to much power to ... the a component, this can lower the lifespan of components so they might not be long for this world anyway.It's like when you buy a car and the repair costs out weigh the cost of buying a new one so you scrap it. Same principals as i can almost promise their will be other flaws with the laptop once you get a motherboard refitted, especially if it's 4 years old, now it might take a year to come happen but it will.So your best bet is to just buy a new one, when a motherboard goes wrong unless it's 100% clear exactly what the fault is to the motherboard and it's not related to delivering power to main components.  You should just replace the entire thing the expense isn't worth it in the long run."
1201,"A peculiarity of Space expansion is that it takes place where mass is not present. Within a galaxy, mass is present, so expansion is banished. Outside of a galaxy, away from the influence of gravity, that's where expansion occurs. What's peculiar about Space itself is that virtual pairs of particles are constantly popping into being and cancelling each other out. This is because mass and Space are the same thing in different form. In fact, in the ""hot closed furnace"" thought experiment used in particle physics, the conditions of the Big Bang are reproduced by superheating nothing more than Space itself, then allowing it to cool. When it's still very hot, free quarks burble into being. As it cools, quarks are able to come together to form Protons and Neurtrons. Mass entails a process within a process, much like the relationship between water and ice. Say you have a situation where you have a sheet of ice laying on top of a dry lake bed. Suddenly, water begins coming out of the Earth from underneath. The pressure shatters the ice, and as the water keeps coming from underneath, and the liquid lake grows in size, the pieces of the former frozen lake stay where they are, and the distance grows between them. Now, the water and the ice are one and the same thing, but their difference in form is what causes each to behave differently. And in purely local terms, when bits of ice are in close enough proximity, the water itself provides the vehicle for the forces of attraction (aka gravity), which keeps groups of ice together, instead of allowing them to drift apart."

1204,"I wrote a blog post a month ago which would suit your requirements too.Originally published on my blog : Arbitrary ThoughtsYou have 3 days and 3 nights to burn off. What do you do? Go to Goa.You and your friends want to have a good time, a break from the excruciating pace of corporate life? Go to Goa.Reunion? Go to Goa.Romantic get-away? Go to Goa.Goa in India is synonymous with holidays, fun, beaches, gorgeous girls, cheap booze and rejuvenation. But most of us are clueless about how to make the best out of 3 (or 4) day stay?What are must-visit places, must-try cuisines, the best beaches, cheap yet convenient accommodation and the most efficient mode of transport? Worry not; the Goan Batman is here to help.Q. What’s the hype about this puny state anyways?A. Goa is a state roughly 43km x 86km (3700 sq km). Out of its total perimeter of about ~260 km, more than 120 km is coastline. Divided into two districts – South Goa and North Goa with district headquarters Madgaon and Panjim respectively, it is most famous for its 20+ beaches and its distinct Portuguese architectural style. It handles a disproportionate amount of foreign tourist traffic – being just 1/800th of India in terms of population and geographical size, it handles around 1/8th of the total foreign tourist arrivals in the country. It is the richest state in India in terms of GDP/capita – 2.5 times the national average. Q. How do I get there? Does this place even have an airport?A. Goa has one airport – Vasco-da-Gama, three railway stations (Vasco, Madgaon, Thivim) and two major bus depots (Panjim and Madgaon). It is well connected with all the major cities in India.[TIP: To search for trains to Goa, enter “Madgaon (code: MAO)” in the destination station. There is no station called Goa.]Q. Ok. I have decided to go to Goa. Now, help me with the packing please? Pretty please?A. There are a few things you need to remember to pack if you are visiting Goa:The official footwear of Goa – a pair of sandals and a pair of beach slippersAt least 3 pairs of shortsA couple of swimwearShampoo and conditioner (the beach sand feels nice when you are in the sea, not so much when it’s in your hair afterwards)Sunscreen (Duh!)iPod/mp3 player + earphones (because music makes everything better)A book or two (for light reading on the beach, if you are a reader)A camera (You definitely want to capture all those moments, because you might not remember some of them)Portable (battery powered) speakers (if you stay up late at night because most of the places close down by 2am)Your driving license (transport is costly in Goa. The best, and cheapest, alternative is to rent bikes)Q. I am just a student/just started working. I want to have a good time without spending much. How do I get the best deal without compromising on the quality?A. You miserly bitch! Let’s see. The major expenditures in Goa would be accommodation, transport and food (and drinks, if you do). Let’s assume you are a party of even number of people. Accommodation : If you visit Goa in the non-peak season i.e. March to October, you will find really good accommodation at a highly affordable price. Good hotels within a 1km radius of popular beaches like Colva and Calangute will charge you around 2000-2500 per room (double bed). With a little negotiation, you can get an extra mattress in the room to make it triple sharing.Cost: 800/person/day = 2400 (for the 3 day stay)Transport : The cheapest way to travel and explore Goa is to rent bikes – taxis are exorbitantly priced (Rs 25/km) and bus network is almost non-existent. Bikes will cost you anywhere from 350-600 per day depending on the bike that you want (350 for the Activa, 500 for Pulsar, 600 for Avenger etc). Fuel cost is over and above that.Cost: Around 500/day for 2 people = 750 per person (for the 3 day trip)Food : Do not go for the expensive shack..."
1205,"Both have similar ISA and both follow RISC structure. But MT6752 has a clock speed of 1.7GHz and has 8 cores whereas Snapdragon 410 4 cores at 1.4Ghz. So,when it comes to speed MT6572 is way ahead of Snapdragon 410.Even the GPU clock speed of MT65772 (695Hz) is better than that of Snapdragon 410(450Hz).  So, MT6572 is obviously faster, it's a beast of a processor for portable devices. But, as your number of cores increases and your clock speed increases you will need more power for each CPU.  Under lower load conditions(normal work) both the CPU will consume equal battery but as the load increases(while playing high graphics game) the overclocking in CPU with more cycle will consume more power and will also generate more heat which will further affect your battery life in the long run and at that instant will somewhat reduce your processing speed. But, I would personally suggest to go far faster CPU's, as in this case battery consumption will not vary greatly but there is great difference in processing power of both the CPU's."

You can try to crack the system of a firewall with some known vulnerabilities, but it would be very hard. If the target is a service provider such as web hosting or email, you can try to breach from these public services, just like the Yahoo breach in 2014. If they have no public service or it’s too hard to crack, you have to crack from inside.For example, if you’ve managed to infest one of the internal workstation with malicious software, the malware can open a connection from inside the firewall. Otherwise, if you have obtained the access right to one of the internal workstation, which is usually reserved by the subcontractors for maintenance, you can also plant malware by yourself.There are many approaches for this. The most common method is email induced virus, fake installer/downloader/patch, or pshishing site. Otherwise, you can also try to infest the personal device (home PC, Smartphone) of the employees and wait for them to spread the malware for you. For the ultmate means, you can approach them in person, persuade them to do this for you with charming, bribe, pretending you’re supervisor, repairman or janitor.Sounds like spy movie to you ? Sadly, in real world people are not smarter than those heros or villains in the movie. What I mentioned above are all real world cases.

1208,"a2aNo-one quite knowsIt is unlikely that there will be mass deportations in either direction. Ity would be too hard & too ugly.In the short term not much will happenHowever, since the #1 concern of people who want OUT is to control immigration is is ridiculous to assume things will not change medium/long termI would expect:Shortly after we vote leave, there will be a suspension of new people arriving having the right to work. Otherwise there will be a flood of people trying to get in before it becomes impossible. If it doesn’t happen proactively, then they arrive, that gets reported and then that “spike” is politically impossible, so it is introduced soon after. This is basically the “emergency brake” but done without/despite EU permission/consent. ie the deadline is mid 2014, not June 2016.EU residents in UK will have to register and start the normal residency / ILR process. Otherwise what was the point of leaving? That is a hassle and expensive, so some will leave.Similarly, EU countries will stop UK citizens living/working freely. Although there is a two year negotiation, if UK is leaving then they need to start registering people etcUK announces new rules, essentially saying new EU citizxens who want to come in are under existing immigration (“Tier 2”) visa rules. The cap might be raised (to allow transition) but again, politically, the point is to be seen to clamp down, so it will likely drop. And the total number reduces, making it harder for non EU to get in.Existing people are not directly affected immediately- but it will be harder for family to join people who are here. That is already the case for non-EU (“Tier 2”) visas: so yet one more way it will be hard for EU residents.Psychologically, I expect it will be less pleasant. The biggest motivation for Brexit is anti-immigration, especially the uncontrolled immigration from EU. If you are one of those immigrants you are going to feel unwanted.Particularly if the economy suffers. People made unemployed because of Brexit after the country voted out because of immigrants are going to be unhappy if they meet an immigrant with a job."

1210,"Adiabatic Lapse Rate - Latent Heat of Condensation | PMF IAS UPSCLapse RateLapse rate is rate of change in temperature observed while moving upward through the Earth’s atmosphere (troposphere to be specific).The lapse rate is considered positive when the temperature decreases with elevation, zero when the temperature is constant with elevation, and negativewhen the temperature increases with elevation (temperature inversion).The lapse rate of non-rising air – commonly referred to as the normal, or Environmental, Lapse Rate (ELR) – is highly variable, being affected by radiation, convection, and condensation; it averages about 5 °C per kilometerin the lower atmosphere (troposphere).Why does temperature fall with elevationWhen we move up a hill, we notice a fall in temperature. This fall in temperature with elevation is primarily due to two reasons.With increase in elevation, the atmospheric pressure falls. Fall in pressure implies that the temperature also falls [Pressure is directly proportional to Temperature and vice versa]With increase in elevation, the concentration of greenhouse gases decrease(Water vapor and carbon dioxide fall sharply with elevation). Hence the heat absorption capacity of atmosphere will also decrease.This sort of fall in temperature with elevation is called Temperature Lapse and the rate at which it happens is called Temperature Lapse Rate or simply Lapse rate.Adiabatic Lapse rateLapse rate is the rate of fall in temperature of atmosphere with elevation.Adiabatic Lapse Rate is the rate of fall in temperature of a rising or a falling air parcel adiabatically.Adiabatic or adiabatically: Heat doesn’t enter or leave the system. All temperature changes are internal.Adiabatic Lapse rate is governed by Gas law.Gas lawAccording to gas law Pressure ‘P’ is directly proportional to Temperature ‘T’ when Volume ‘V’ is a constant.Adiabatic Process: A Parcel of Rising or Falling AirAn air bubble rises in water whereas stone sinks. This is obvious. The stone is denser (heavier than water) and it sinks whereas the air bubble is less denser (lighter than water) and it rises.Similarly, a parcel of air rises when it is less denser than the surrounding environment and it falls when its density becomes greater than the surrounding environment.A Parcel of Rising AirWhen an air parcel is subjected to differential heating compared to the surrounding air, it becomes lighter (less denser) or heavier (more denser) depending on whether the air parcel is heated or cooled.When an air parcel receives more heat than the surrounding air, its temperature increases leading to an increase in volume (Increase in Volume == Fall in Density). The air parcel becomes lighter than the surrounding air and it starts to rise. This process is non-adiabatic (there is heat exchange between the air parcel and the external environment).But when the air parcel starts to rise, the ambient pressure on it starts to fall [The atmospheric pressure decreases with height, so the pressure on the air parcel decreases with height]. With the fall in ambient pressure, the temperature falls and the volume increases. This is adiabatic [there is no heat exchange between the air parcel and the external environment. All the temperature changes are internal. Temperature changes are only due to change in pressure or volume or both].This fall in temperature with the rising of the air parcel is called Adiabatic Temperature Lapse. And the rate at which it happens is called Adiabatic Lapse Rate [This is Positive Adiabatic Lapse Rate as the Temperature is falling].[Lapse Rate == fall in temperature with height. Adiabatic Lapse Rate == Fall in temperature in a rising parcel of air without losing any internal heat]Rising of a parcel of air (and associated Positive Adiabatic Lapse Rate) is the first step in the formation of Thunderstorms, Tornadoes and Cyclones. [We will see this in detail in future posts]A Parcel of Falling AirAn air parcels falls to the lower levels of troposphere when it is cooled sufficiently.When an air parcel is in the upper levels, it gets cooled due to lower temperatures (Lapse Rate). It’s volume falls and it’s density increases. When it becomes more denser than the surroundings, it starts to fall.This also happens when an air parcel is in contact with cooler surfaces like mountain slopes. We will see more about this in temperature inversion.The beginning of fall is a non-adiabatic process as there is an exchange of heat between the air parcel and the surrounding environment.When an air parcel is falling, the atmospheric pressure acting on it will increase and its internal temperature will increase adiabatically. [This is Negative Adiabatic Lapse Rate as the Temperature is rising].Adiabatic Lapse Rate in simple termsAdiabatic change refers to the change in temperature with pressure.On descent through atmosphere, the lower layers are compressed under atmospheric pressure. As a result, the temperature increases.On ascent, the air expands as pressure ‘decreases’. This expansion reduces the temperature and aids condensation of water vapour."
1211,"No. While the standard Everest route is essentially a very long, very brutal slog of a climb (i.e. it's mostly an endurance route rather than some highly technical mixed-climb), that in of its self precludes most people from realistically making it to the summit. Not just anyone is going to will themselves to train for that, build skills on smaller peaks for that, stay with the dream of getting to that.That's not merely a physical training issue either. You can go to a far smaller mountain and watch incredibly fit people throw in the towel right and left. Slogging up a frozen mountain for hours and certainly for days is very much ""in your head."" No just anyone is going to want it enough to push their mental attitude to the place it needs to be to endure through a couple months on Everest.But while those are something people with drive can overcome, the altitude, lack of oxygen and intense cold is simply going to to stop a good number of people from ever being able to summit. Altitude Mountain Sickness (and the far more severe HACE and HAPE that develop from there) can happen to anyone, even experienced climbers, but for some people a severe onset is all but guaranteed at almost any altitude. You're not making it to advanced base camp let alone the summit if you have a condition that triggers those.Many other conditions exist that would be [nearly] insurmountable as well especially given the exposure / effort involved in assisting a climber that far up which pretty much counters any technology or human force that might be applicable to another type of challenge. Thus a great number of people are effectively ineligible from [sanely] trying."

1213,"Normally I try do not interfere with posts / comments about our own company as it may influence future posts / answers / comments. However, this is a very interesting question which I receive very often. So …No, FEDEVEL Academy will not teach you how to make an entire modern PC, nor how to design a motherboard, server or a mobile phone. These are the most advanced designs which are done by the most skilled engineers.In the courses, I do teach about the techniques which I use during these advanced designs, (e.g. how to check symbols, footprints, schematic, how to do placement, route memories or high speed stuff), however you do need experience. There are no shortcuts. I guarantee, there is no video nor a course which after you watch you can become a really good design engineer. That would be too simple - we would be flooded with excellent engineers, however in reality it is extremely hard to find a good one.The courses help you to eliminate the most common problems, show you some tips and tricks to work more efficiently and save you time, so you do not need to teach yourself on your own mistakes, but you still need to learn about the boards you are designing.You need to learn how to do things right, I mean, really right. Do you remember your beginnings with electronics? Every beginner makes mistakes - beginners are able to make several mistakes on one page of schematic and spent hours or days trying to make work a board with 20 components. Now imagine, that you have to design a board with 1000 to 5000 of components and 50 to 150 pages of schematic. That is the complexity of a motherboard. You really need to get an experience how to make it right at the first time - debugging a motherboard is not an option, when you connect it to power, it just must boot up. Otherwise, hmm … if the board will not boot up, it’s going to cost you a lot of time, money and you may never find out what is wrong ….To be able to design a board right (a board which will work at the first time), just the techniques itself are not enough. You really need to understand how it’s going to work - not only the hardware, but also software. How the board is going to boot up, what is happening there … it’s a huge amount of information which you usually learn from your previous projects. Mostly you learn from design guides, datasheets and from non-working boards by debugging them and trying to figure out what went wrong.You really need to spent certain number of hours doing board design to be able to develop so complex boards. And I am pretty sure it’s not 100 hours … not even 1000 hours. Some people say, that you need to spent 5 000 - 10 000 hours doing a certain thing to become a professional in it … or other words 5 to 10 years."

1216,"I do not know why Muslim invaders did not depict any massacres done by them. They probably didn’t feel it necessary because their actions spoke louder than anything they could have done. The 1202 storm campaign of Muhammad Ghori alone resulted in the destruction of hundreds of Hindu temples. They built mosques on the site of demolished Hindu temples at key Hindu pilgrimage sites. They destroyed functioning Universities like Nalanda, Takshashila, Vikramshila etc. Their historians chronicled tales of terror and destruction. They left behind monuments which were clearly built using materials from destroyed Hindu temples.According to some estimates Muslims killed 80 million Hindus in their long 600 year rule. Their rule can be summed up by this quote:""If the revenue collector spits into a Hindu's mouth, the Hindu must open his mouth without hesitation"" -- Qazi Mughisuddin legal officer of Sultan Alauddin Khilji(REF:ELLIOT and DOWSON, The History of India, as Told by Its Own Historians; The Muhammadan Period ( 1876-77)).There was also forced conversions of Hindus by Muslims. An infamous example of a forcible conversion attempt was Aurangzeb's attempt to convert Kashmiri Pundits to Islam in the 1670s. Kashmiri Pundits were saved by the Sikh Guru Tegh Bahadur who was executed by Aurangzeb for defending the rights of non-Muslims to live in India.Another example would be 16th century Varanasi. Muslim clergy made it impossible for Hindus to live peacefully in Varanasi. Sri Madhusudan Saraswati met Akbar and told him of the plight of Hindus. Akbar told him that he should form his own forces to resist the Muslim clergy. It is Akbar's advice that led to the birth of Naga Sannyasis.Will Durant, the famous American historian summed it up like this:""The Islamic conquest of India is probably the bloodiest story in history. It is a discouraging tale, for its evident moral is that civilization is a precious good, whose delicate complex of order and freedom, culture and peace, can at any moment be overthrown by barbarians invading from without or multiplying within.""The Story of civilization by Will DurantAny other civilization would have been destroyed if they had suffered 80 million casualties. This long unfortunate 600 year old history of Muslim rule throws a long shadow even today."
1217,"From the thread [Serious] How young of a LeBron would the average adult male be able to beat 1 on 1?, user xdawsonsic:I played against Lebron a handful of times when he was a Freshman, so I have a little experience in this area.I'll relay my thoughts about the game I remember the most.I was 18. A senior, decent athlete, a few D3 offers, a few ""preferred walk on"" for some D1 schools. I was 6'3-6'4 and 180-190 pounds. He was 13-14 years old, and and near the same size as I was.. but enormous feet, long arms, but lanky. Probably weighed... 170?I'll try to keep it somewhat short... I could hold my own against him, only because he was very, very raw. I feel my game was as polished as it could be, while he was still just getting things figured out. We both ended the game with similar stat lines, but the X factor was just the raw explosiveness and athleticism... something you honestly can't account for when talking about size, weight and even age.I'm sure alot of you have played basketball, maybe even lately.. but you know that first few possessions of the game? Sizing things up.. who can move, who can shoot, how are they guarding us.... Lebron was already on a different planet in terms of just sheer velocity. He could just get off of his feet, make a cut, or grab a rebound while I'm still flat footed. He didn't have springs in his legs.. he had trampolines. I had played against alot of tier 1 talent at that point at 5-Star and Blue Chip camps, but the odd thing is.. I knew IMMEDIATELY that this guy was something different.. and that isn't just hindsight.Anyway, we lost that game by 6. Which ended up being their closest game of the year (applause? kappa)... Lebron got a steal in the last 5 seconds to close the game.. and traveled the length of the court for the final ""nail in the coffin"" dunk. I was so pissed of.. he wasn't going to dunk on our home floor... I'm going to chase this FRESHMAN down and foul the hell out of him. Now.. I could jump, could dunk fairly easily.. so I figured... I can do this.. plus we are the same size.. what could go wrong? So I get to him (he sort of took a wide approach angle), jump... andddd he's clearly a foot above me at the apex. Easily a foot. I felt like Isiah in that Celtics series this year. I quickly decided to just do what I could, and just wailed on whatever part of his arms or head I could reach. The dunk failed, so I guess it was a success... but it was just another lesson I realized that game. This man is far superior, and he hasn't even hit puberty yet. This is also one of those days when I decided to not play basketball in college. A rude awakening to just how good you have to be compete.Anyway.. back to your question... St. V was good that year with alot of studs, so Lebron was considered ""the next big thing"", but everyone knew he was different. I first heard about him when he was around 11 years old, and I know he was beating people up at the courts since at least that age. It's also important to realize that Lebron had absolutely NO ""puberty"" stage of being uncoordinated, or 'weak', or anything of the sort. Maverick (Lebron's cousin / business manager) used to say that ""he's the one to watch out for"".. back when we were maybe 15-16 (Maverick was trying to steal my girlfriend, who went to St.V..... Mav if you are somehow reading this... what's good man?).....so that being said.. all I can say is.. athleticism and that 'god given' freak-of-nature, all-worldy talent is just something you have to 'witness' to fully comprehend.Have you seen Lebron’s rookie highlights? They look… wrong, like a very athletic 5′8 guy playing on a court shrunk by about 15%, so that the average guy wouldn’t crack five feet, and most other players are lumbering 5′6ers or whatever. The first time I saw those highlights I couldn’t believe a man that size could be that fast, that quick. It was, for want of a better word, unfair.An exchange between xdawsonsic and some other redditors:you should absolutely puff your chest about it. Say ""I blocked LeBron James multiple times"" and have it on your tombstone. It is a technically true statement.I was moreso elaborating on the notion that age 13 was probably the year any ""regular"" guy had a punchers chance to compete with him.Definitely ""regular"" in quotation marks. Division 3 offers and walk on status at D1 is pretty impressive, and it was still a back and forth for you too(that's what I got from the post anyway).As a 5-9 dude, I doubt I would be able to beat a 10 year old LeBron.User ay21690 played Lebron in junior year, when he was on his way to the second of three consecutive Mr Ohio titles:We had the chance to play SVSM at a camp during the summer of his junior year. End of the camp is both a single elimination tournament, then an expo where coaches picked a handful of the top players to run a pick up game.2nd round, we kept up with them for five minutes because zero defense was played. Now I'm 5'10"", but I feel like I was pretty (keyword was) pretty quick. We decided to run a triangle and 2 against him on defense.He literally laughed in our faces and scored every single time. I couldn't keep up with him. We lost by 42 points, that was only because he subbed out at halftime and Romeo Travis chucked 3s the rest of the game.To which xdawsonsic replied:I'm actually glad I got to play against 13-14 year old Lebron... and not THAT version. I actually think he was scariest when he was Junior. He played incredibly hard. Senior year was a joke to him, I think.I was in attendance for the Oak Hill vs. St. V game (Carmelo versus Lebron) that year... and I couldn't fathom that I was watching the same guy.Lebron had 36 that game, Carmelo had 34.NintendoJesus adds more perspective:Man, this brings me back. I played against 3 future NBA players in High School/College, Jason Gardner, Wally Szczerbiak, and Melvin Levitt. 2 of them washed out of the NBA, and Wally wasn't exactly 1st team NBA but I think he made an All Star game or 2 and had a good career. Gardner was the only one I played against in a real game, the rest were pick up games at Miami OH.Unless you have played in a game vs a professional athlete, I don't think it's possible to understand how different they are from us normies. It's like they are a subspecies of human that have evolved into something better. Like X-men or something. They don't play the same game as us. It's like if you played against 5 year olds in a driveway with a 5 foot Fisher Price goal. You can't double them, you can't trap them, you may as well not even be there.And like you, I was good, not just like ""back in the day"" good, but like legit good. I'm 6'4"", played point, could handle it, could shoot, could throw it off the board and dunk in my sleep. To a random passerby, I probably looked like I could play. But no, I was an insect, Wally once scored 11 straight on me 2 games in a row.(We played to 11, 1's and 2's) He was so strong that he could just pivot and shrug his shoulders and create enough space to do anything he wanted. It was like playing against your dad when you're 5 years old.They indirectly ended my basketball career. I knew I could never be what they were. No matter what I did. And 2 of these guys didn't even make it in the NBA. I can't imagine playing against Lebron. He's from another planet.From nimster09:Was lebron quiet on the court back then? I imagine teenage lebron trash talking to be quite interesting.The response:He was silent. Didn't say anything, didn't really have to.I think I have said this before, but to me this was the Lebron in his purest form. Just played his ass off, didn't bitch about calls, wasn't running point or trying to coach his guys.. Just.. hungry. He looked right through you. If I wasn't a cocky, stubborn teenager I would have been terrified.Overall, I'd say he was like..a puppy.. but a puppy who realized he was probably the biggest dog on the block, and was only on the court to show it to you.More perspective, different sport, from hootener:I totally get you about having to witness it. I went to high school with a guy who went on to play starting LB for the 49ers. You really can't put into words how different a star athlete's ability is, even at a young age.In middle School football this guy played offense, defense, and was the kicker for kickoff. He routinely put the ball through the opposing uprights in kickoff at 12-13 years old. The raw ability was just on a different plane than what you see out of even the best ""normal"" high school athletes.The difference between a great athlete and a superstar is hard to explain at that age, but you definitely know it when you see it.More, from oshitson:Your story took me down memory lane and mine was very close as far as size, ability, offers, etc. I had a similar experience playing against a couple of guys who ended up playing in the NBA and a few in the NFL. Your description of sizing up players and figuring out who is on the top level in the first few minutes is spot on for anyone who has played enough ball.The easiest tell for me was the speed of cutting and acceleration off the ground while grabbing a rebound. The guys on that level could jump up, grab a board, and be at the quarter to half court mark before you landed and regained your momentum.One of the guys who played in the NFL was probably the best athlete I've ever witnessed in person even though I wasn't playing against him at the time. I had some friends from a team in our area who played against him in the state championship. Their team was stacked with D1 talent and he single-handedly beat them like you would your little cousins or kids in the neighborhood.The response:Yes, all that sounds very, very similar.. which makes me even more in awe of Westbrook. To be our size, and do what he does, is just all-world athleticism. He makes true NBA stars look pedestrian.I've made the argument that he is the best athlete in sports, and haven't heard a proper counter. Baseball? Elite center fielder, could run down anything. He's Ricky Henderson. Football? Corner... he is Sherman's size, and dare I say, would play more physical and be even more of a lunatic.Just a beautiful thing to watch..From Massive14:I went to watch him play a state tournament game in person during I believe LeBron's junior year. It was a regional game at The University of Toledo. What stuck out the most was his extra gear. It always felt like all the other kids were trying their hardest, but he was such a good athlete that he was walking when everyone else was running, and he was still dominating.When he went into that extra gear though, my goodness. It was like watching a grown man against babies. There's only a handful of athletes that I've ever seen in person that could flip the switch like that (Michael Bradley and Sidney Crosby to name a couple, but not as extreme).From HeyZuesHChrist:One of my best friends was a D1 athlete. He was actually an All-American in college for a sport he didn't go to college to play originally. He ended up switching sports after his freshman year and eventually trained for the Olympics.He is a bit older than me and is in his 40's now. I've been playing adult social sports with him for ten years now and when you see somebody who is as gifted an athlete as he is you are almost in awe of how incredible it is. Their power and explosion is something that when you see it you know right away that they are on another level. I'm not a bad athlete myself. I played and was good at just about every sport I played growing up, and I played a number of sports (soccer, baseball, basketball, wrestling). My friend, even at 43 years old, is more explosive than I was in my prime (I'm 36).My younger brother is about as cocky as they come. He was a good high school soccer player and to this day he will tell you that he could have played D1 if he wanted to. Mind you, he was not recruited by a single school, never heard from a college coach at any level (not even D3) yet he claims he could have played D1 if he wanted to. I've tried to explain to him that if he ever actually saw a D1 athlete up close and played with them he'd understand the level at which you need to be to compete at that level.I'm only talking about D1 athletes here, too. You played against LeBron fucking James.On Randy Moss, from orion:this reminds me when i was a kid, in small town wv and seeing randy moss spank the ass off my home town school. i'll never forget i was like 5 or 6 and my grandma took me, and even showing up i was kinda like ""Holy hell what are all these people doing here for a game of herbert hoover (if anyone seen the flood coverage in wv a year ago it's one of the schools that washed away and shut down) and rand high?"" but by the end of that game i knew there was something very different about that player.Shawn Kemp:I played against Shawn Kemp when he was a freshman in Elkhart Indiana and I was a senior. He was only 6'8"" then and grew to 6'10"". He was an absolute freak of nature and it was surreal to see someone that size, that age move like he did. It really was witnessing areal ""God gifted"" talent in motion. If you've never seen something like this it's really hard to explain. They way they move, the speed, the precision, it's just amazing to be among another human that can do that.More:I know for a fact that the average male (Me in size, probbaly above average in skill [I'm over 30, 5'10"" and still play basketball a couple times a week and played competitively when I was younger]) can't get blocks on any player, even those who are much smaller than me every time. Lots of times, sure. But not every time.And this is, after all, mini lebron, future GOAT, who routinely made mockeries of kids FAR bigger than himself and FAR more athletic and skilled than the average adult male when he was a freshman in HS against much bigger Seniors.I'm sorry but even if you can, as an average adult male, beat 10 year old lebron, hes still going to D you up much more than you think. He's still going to get some buckets.People have a tendency to drastically underestimate the sheer difference in skill between even the worst NBA players and the best non-NBA players. If you're talking the GOAT, who at 10 was probably barely shorter than the average adult male, you're not winning easily.I've played at the gym with enough 8th graders to know that most are just like you say. Not close to being competitive. But I've seen others, kids that ended up leading their HS teams but never sniffed anything beyond DII schools, routinely out-skill every adult on the floor, despite weighing 120 and being shorter than everyone.I just can't emphasize enough. The best HS players are far better than the average adult and get crushed against an average D2 college player. The average D1 college player will never even sniff the NBA, and get crushed by the very worst players in the D-League, who compete for minutes with guys who will never sign a 10-day contract. Skill matters, and there is a very wide spectrum from average to Lebron.All i'm saying is that if you played 10 year old Lebron and blocked his shot every time and he couldn't guard you at all, you're well beyond 'average'. And if you're average, you're deluding yourself."

There is a great deal of air pollution and the traffic is ever present! Bless the one occasion you can get where you are going without traffic jams. What I can appreciate is that most places you need:the supermarket, Pizza Hut, dominoes, clothes stores, agencies, banks and schools are never too far away. Another thing is that fares are pretty much the same to go anywhere, so it doesn't cost much to go far distance. I pray this is mirrored in my home parish someday. most of Jamaica’s population lives there (forgive me if this is less than correct) so it’s likely you'll meet some interesting people along with the less desirable ones. In tandem with the large populace in such a small area, there is more crime, I've had both laptop and phone stolen from me in the space of a year being there. Otherwise, there are also more places to hang out or meet up with friends. One just has to be cautious about protecting your life and possessions there. For me as well, it has been an escape from parental reign and helped me to grow into a more responsible, self gratifying adult :)"

And, if this is your first time installing solar, you probably have a lot of questions like:How much are costs?Costs depend on a lot of things, such as your system size, and outside of the installation fees, BOS is going to add up. But if you want to know how much installation alone costs, this is going to be dependent on the amount of hours you will have to be charged for.Are there any other accessories I will need for the system?Yes and these accessories are mainly considered BOS (Balance of System). BOS includes combiner box, solar cable, copper wire, AC disconnect, DC disconnect etc.Is installing solar going to be a construction zoning issue?Like a zoning permit the way you would build an addition to your house, you will need permits from building department in your municipalities.How long will installing solar take?Installing solar usually takes about 2 days, more or less, but this target is based on 20 panels.Installing solar will usually take about 70 hours for productionA good tool you can use for Atwater, California can be found on the HahaSmart price checker tool.

1222,"Why are black women not regarded as attractive as Asian or Latin women, even though they are more represented in the media?These are my thoughts:The recent increase in black women shown ""positively"" in the media is just that, recent. I wouldn't expect people's previous views on black women to change based on the few movies/series (etc) that are actually showing relatable black women. Also, who's to say that the audience of these shows are anything but women (of all races) and black people. I assume that most men, aside from a few movies and staple series, would rather watch the news and sports. As Nicole Sansone wrote, there is a stereotype of black women being very ""strong"" or ""strong-minded."" Many men get intimidated by the thought of potentially dating a ""strong"" woman, meaning a woman who doesn't submit easily and who might be argumentative, etc. That stereotype still turns off many men, I'm sure.Then there's the physical aspect. I've read on someone's blog that he wouldn't date a black woman because God designed every race for itself and he further explained himself to say that for example, Asian males (stereotypically) have smaller penises and so it is assumed that Asian females have ""smaller vaginas."" (I can't believe I'm typing this...) On the flip side, Black men (stereotypically) have larger penises so (of course), Black women have larger vaginas (ugh). So there are ignorant thinking like these that might turn men off. The other physical aspect would be the body shape. Many black men love curvy women, and they take it anyway they can. My uncle (black man) absolutely worships larger women, and that's pretty common where I'm from. Most men from other cultures are repulsed by it. There are mixtures of body types in the black community (obviously) but in many cases, there are many sexy, curvaceous ladies that might be too much to handle for some. Also, for some reason, people think that thick lips and larger hips/butt, do not look as nice on black women than they do on women of other races.Some men might not want to deal with the ""black family."" They are stereotypically seen as loud, fun-loving people, but maybe not the man's cup of tea. There are a few men that are not sure if black women would be attracted to them in the first place because they do not look like the stereotypical ""black man,"" so they figure, it's not worth the rejection.Some men do not like the arrogance that some of us black women portray. Most of the times it's not intentional arrogance. It's the ""nobody tells me I'm beautiful, so I have to tell myself that I'm beautiful"" kind of arrogance. Or it might be the ""the media refuses to acknowledge my beauty, so I will do it myself"" kind of arrogance. It's the ""I don't want people think I lack self-confidence, so I will act as though I have lots of it"" kind of arrogance. It can also be the ""I don't anyone to tease me so I will make sure they know I love myself regardless of what they say"" kind of arrogance. It can also be true self-confidence and nothing is wrong with that.Some people just have their preferences, whatever the reasons might be. We cannot force anyone to like us. We can just continue to improve ourselves, and better ourselves any way we can, as human beings (not only as black women), because while many people place lots of emphasis on race, ethnicity, etc, there is much more to a person that defines them than just the way they look."
1223,"VOCABULARY:Firstly, try remembering words in groups. Like, introvert, extrovert, ambivert. Again, ingenious, ingenuous, indigenous, etc.Secondly, find the roots of the words! Like 'greg', 'bene', 'mala', 'flu', 'con', etc. Now see which particular words have these words mentioned in them and the likes. Greg means crowd, bene is something good, mala is something bad, etc. From greg, you get gregarious,etc. From bene you get benevolent, benefit, beneficial,etc. From flu you get fluent, effluvium, affluent, confluence, mellifluous, etc. So when you come across words which have these small words in them, you can easily remember what it means. This way, remembering words becomes much easier.Thirdly, make sentences with the words. Example: Epicure. The word means ""one who has love for very fine things."" Now, if you have difficulty in remembering the word, make a sentence with it. Like, a man with epicurant tendencies must have a fat wallet.That way, you can remember the word and the meaning.Fourthly, picture them. If you picture or visualize the word or the sentence that you have made in your mind, remembering the word becomes very very easy, trust me. Try this one.Fifthly, connect each and every word with the eight parts of speech. If the given word is a noun, convert it into an adjective and vice versa. Doing this, you will be learning two words at the same time meaning the same thing.GRAMMAR:Simply follow Wren & Martin for grammar. It will help a lot. Basic plus standard level.WRITING SKILLS:Just write and practice all the above things that I have mentioned. You can also take up dictation. Ask someone to dictate a particular passage to you. Make sure their pronunciation is correct.Follow these sincerely and you will master in English.Good luck :)"

1225,"The beauty of evolution is that you can not predict it because it is random. It is not heading towards a specific direction so we can't just extrapolate and say okay this is what will happen after 100 or 200 years from now. Now coming back to your question that what will happen if humans just vanished from the face of this earth ?To answer this question let me take you back 65 millions years ago when the dinosaurs ruled this planet. There were no humans back then. Dinosaurs were the dominant predators. And then one fine day(exaggeration; of-course not a day !) due to some cataclysmic event they vanished !!! Ofcourse it hurt the ecological balance because they were right at the top of the food chain but no disastrous results which we can infer, simply because somebody else took their place. Nature has an innate way of adjusting to these kind of changes. It may take a while(million years or so) but everything comes to nature's harmonic equilibrium. And I guess same would be the fate with humans. Rather if you ask me this world will be better off without us. I am not a pessimist but I believe overall we have done more ecological imbalance than it would happen due to our extinction."

Something has been done to them, something has been taken away from them. It is not fair.

1231,"Motivation is bullshit.What you need is a proven system that propels you towards action regardless of whether you feel “motivated” or not.I’ll discuss a 3-step process that allowed me to show up at the gym consistently and totally transform my physique in the process:Using this 3-step process you too will be able to show at the gym reliably and achieve the body of your dreams.Ready?Let’s do this.Step 1 - Get Clear On What You’re Trying To Achieve (Set SMART goals)By planning to the end you will not be overwhelmed by circumstances. Gently guide fortune and help determine the future by thinking far ahead.Robert Greene“Hitting the gym everyday” is nothing but a means to an end.What do you hope to achieve by hitting the gym everyday?Here’s an example of how I answered this question in the form of a SMART goal:Specific - What do you want to accomplish?I wanted to gain muscle, lose fat, and build the body of a Greek statue.Measurable - How will you measure your progress?I measured my goal of gaining muscle by keeping track of how much weight I lifted in every workout.I measured my goal of losing fat by keeping track of my waist measurement.I measured my goal of looking like a Greek statue by keeping track of my shoulder to waist ratio.Achievable - How can you accomplish the goal?I did the research and created a plan in alignment with my goal.Relevant - Is your goal important to you?I was willing to pay the price.Time-bound - When will you accomplish your goal?I set a deadline for 8-weeks, but my transformation pictures above are about 4-months apart.Going through the SMART goal-setting process will set you up with a clear picture of what you’re trying to achieve.Having a SMART goal in place will determine the direction of your actions - you’ll be sure of whether the ladder you’re attempting to climb is actually leaning against the right wall.Step 2 - Write Down Your IntentionResearchers found that when people filled out this sentence:“During the next week, I will partake in at least 20 minutes of vigorous exercise on [DAY] at [TIME OF DAY] at/in [PLACE].”They were 2–3x more likely to exercise compared to the control group who did not make plans for their future behaviour[1] .This is a concept known in psychology as “implementation intentions”.Writing down when you’re going to exercise, for how long, and where you’re going to do it is a simple and proven way to easily triple your odds of showing up at the gym.Here’s my implementation intention:During the next week, I will complete 3 workouts on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday at 5:30PM at the Beverly Centre Gym.Yes, it really is possible to sculpt a lean and muscular physique with 3-workouts per week.Step 3 - Put Your Money Where Your Mouth IsBetting money on the achievement of your goal will be like adding rocket fuel to your discipline.The best way to do this is by making a commitment on stickK.StickK is an awesome platform where you can make a commitment (i.e. go to the gym everyday) and leverage your cash to go to an anti-charity, charity, friend or foe if you don’t stick to it.You can also add a friend or family member to help hold you accountable.Betting money on yourself is powerful.After many failed attempts, leveraging cash on stickK was what finally allowed me to stop smoking weed:Will I ever smoke weed again?I don’t know.What I do know is that my gym sessions have been way more consistent since kicking the habit of smoking joints.Conclusion..."

So what happened was in latest PC's with their Hyper-threading technology,  more high speed CPU's that wait time(which as i said earlier was made to make a program wait for sometime before running and was directly linked to CPU frequency/power)  got reduced...  Like really reduced proportional to CPU Speed.

1236,"Hey students i did score 354 but it was on one of the days the paper was unreasonable and did have some questions which left me wondering.Most important thing needed in bitsat is not a super high IQ level of toppers but good preperation, with good preperation i have seen many average students beat iit rank holders in bitsat . This is also because most of the students who have the ability to score 320+ are busy studying for iit advance and do not give much precedence to bitsat. What many students fail to do is read the syllabi of bitsat carefully if you do that you would notice that topics like cell ( biology ones) , zeolites, biological properties of Ca and Mg , cement and most importantly petroleum (papers on 4 different dates had a question from this chapter and left all the students in unawares)Bitsat has a tendency to ask questions in chemistry which are absurd and from parts of ncert which we generally pay no attention too.Read ncert of chemistry very thoroughly plz .Its like finding easter eggs in games. Also read up the syllabus and tally up whether you know all the things or not in maths and physics too.IMPORTANT THING IS THESE MAY PROVIDE YOU 20–25 MARKS MORE THAN AN AVERAGE FELLOW , BUT YOU MUST FOLLOW FOLLOWING TO SCORE ATLEAST 320 IN BITSAT——-TIME MANAGEMENT—— most of us who are of average intellect are not able to complete the test in time and lose up on one or two very easy questions. To avoid this first attempt the easiest portion of bitsat - english and mental ability - for this portion no need to study anything extra if your english is fine or average. This section in actual bitsat (not mock tests - they are harder) would actually be over before you know it. (20 mins max).After this attempt your favourite out of pcm (that will reduce the amount of easy question left behind) important thing is never attempt maths at last.Maths of bitsat is very lengthy and of 135 marks so lots at stake here ( generally if you are weak in maths never attempt it at the last in iit mains or advance or any paper— big theory behind it).Whatever your pattern maybe perfect it over atleast 4 complete bitsat paper. While doing the paper at home attempt the paper in 2 hr 40 mins , if you are able to attempt 130–140 questions well and good, give approx. 60 secs per q. in chemistry 80 secs in physics (easily achievable) and 120 secs MAX in maths. During this if you come across any calculation intensive question in p and c or you are not able to do them correctly in one attempt; leave them and GO FORWARDS , YOU would have plenty of time to attempt them later.HIGH SPEED—- speed is another thing that you can improve if you are preparing for jee also than you must have given tons of papers where you would do mind numbing 60 questions in 180 mins and score 50–60% , but in bitsat you have to attempt 150(162) questions in 180 mins and score 75–80% .This can be acheived by repeatedly solving as many questions as you can in time boundation. The more no of different questions you solve in physics and maths - your speed would increase consistently because you are creating a habit of applying a set no. of formulas and concepts over a wide range of problems - which increase your chance of attempting correctly a similar or look alike question in bitsat or jee mains. The questions are generally easier in bitsat than in jee mains, but time is very less so if you are feeling insecure attempting an unknown question better leave it untouched.Accuracy— only way to increase this is to keep calm and concentrate on the current question only , read the question properly even write down the given info/make a diagram(mechanics) , as it will reduce silly mistakes.TO ATTEMPT OR NOT TO ATTEMPT EXTRA 12 QUESTIONS—— after you have once seen through the entire paper the following scenarios may remain====attempted questions are 135+ and time left - 20+ mins definitely go for itattempted questions 125–135 and time left 20+mins you should not go for it as , even at 90% accuracy (unreal) you will only score 300, go for it if you have 30+ mins left only if only 20 mins or less are left it is better to attempt the left lengthy questions and revise the paper thoroughly might try putting the options or values in maths or physics portionAnother thing to do, this was for 2016 only as extra questions were harder to do and most students were able to correctly attempt 8 of it ( most of them were toppers). So go to exam hall half an hour before (if you are giving the test in 2nd or 3rd slot) and ask the students coming out whether to attempt 12 qs or not as they can make a difference if they are easy which was the case on some days."

For that matter, how would someone from Romania, Poland or Russia see it?However, let us say, for the sake of argument, that what we are talking about people in the countries of West and Central Europe, who are Caucasian, plus their former colonies that have historically been white, Christian and prosperous. I have to qualify it with Caucasian, because immigration has brought racial and cultural diversity to those countries. A French citizen of Algerian origin might have rather different views than a French citizen whose is a descendant of the Celts or the Franks. If they were observant Muslims they might have rather strong views that are not favourable to the cultures of either country. What view would a Vietnamese origin citizen of Australia have, or someone in Manchester whose descent comes from what is now Pakistan, or a Sino-American, or a member of Canada's large and growing Sikh community?This Question almost seems to ask for white, prosperous view of the two countries, in those white countries where there is freedom of speech. This makes me feel rather uncomfortable, but say, so I can provide some kind of Answer, we stick with Whites in the democratic, prosperous world, those people of Roman, Greek, Celtic, Baltic, Germanic, Basque, Slavic and a few other origins. Their cultural cradle was Europe and the British Isles, but, we would have to ask ourselves when they became aware of anything beyond the gates of their own villages. This is partially important because the recorded histories of the Chinese and South Asian cultures is longer than it is for Europe and Britain. There were states of various kinds in these two regions before the known history of the European and British ones. There presumably was a point where Europe became organized enough that people learned of China and what would become India. Perhaps the Greeks and Etruscans are the earliest ethnic groups in Europe known to have at least city states, so maybe they knew first.However, we don't really know for sure when the peoples of Europe and Britain became aware of what is now India and China. I would think that, perhaps. the consciousness of what is now India came first, because it is closer. The Greeks and Romans certainly knew of South Asia, although how much this knowledge remained with the elites, we don't know. (So, did a Roman plebeian have any idea? As far as I know, it is not recorded.) Also, we do not know what impression the Greeks and Romans had of China, which was at the other end of a known caravan route. Maybe, they did know of China at the same time. In fact, I recall reading of Chinese emissaries who reached the Roman Empire. And, the Persians had the effect of keeping Europe and South Asia rather apart.A Lot Of ForgettingThen, there was the fall of the Western Roman Empire, which is generally considered to be in 476 CE. The Eastern Roman (Or, later what is now called the Byzantine Empire) lasted much later. I have seen modern historians doubt how abject the collapse of Western European culture was after 476. Within a few hundred years the modern Romance languages had begun to form. The Church had retained some of the old Roman knowledge. However, trade routes did decline. The Germanic people,s who were the dominant post-Roman groups in northern Europe and England might have known somewhat less to begin with.As Western, Northern and Central Europe, and the British Isles, settled down into identifiable states and principalities, there must have been a gradual wakening about the “outside”, probably among the educated classes first. The travels of Marco Polo are sometimes seen as the great reawakening of European knowledge of China. Around 1300 he reported back to the Venetians his impressions of China and at least some of its culture.People of South Asian origin may want to correct me, but I am not aware of any equivalent of Marco Polo for India. The Europeans had to find a way around what is now the Middle East. Vasco de Gama did just that from 1497 to 1499. Rounding the southern tip of Africa and sailing to South Asia was doubtless a much simpler task for European sailors than the additional voyage of rounding Southeast Asia to China. It seems likely that general European knowledge of China might have taken a bit longer to develop.What Did The Europeans Find?I think the circumstances that China and South Asia were in, when the Europeans re-established large scale contact, have effected European impressions of China and India ever since. They encountered the massive Ming Dynasty which controlled a huge area, certainly from the view of Europeans, from a single capital. The Europeans encountered a united China, with an official culture dictated from the centre. Even though the different dialects (or maybe, more properly, sub-languages) of China were not mutually intelligible, there was a will to see them as one language. I think this made it possible to “fix” on China as a national entity.By contrast. I think the Mughal Empire made it difficult for Europeans to comprehend India as a culture. To put it, maybe, even too simply, it was a Persian-Islamic effort to impose a culture on top of a very large Hindu majority. Having lived in India, I think the Mughals were a distraction. The created an impressive artistic legacy and great monuments. A European visiting India could be very impressed, and maybe think of northern India, in particular, as part of what is now the Middle East.However, this was wrong. Hindu South Asia carried on beneath. It encompassed a racially diverse population, speaking unrelated languages. There was no India in the way there was a China. I think the British Raj was a partial “unpeeling” of the Persian-Islamic culture of South Asia.And, what emerged from it was quite difficult for a European to understand. Parts of the incomprehension had to do with race. The Han Chinese are hugely the majority of all Chinese people. The Ming Culture was their culture. Despite the humiliations imposed by the Europeans and the Japanese, the Chinese culture that continued past the Mings was still their, Han culture. By contrast, Indians don't at all look the same (Although Bollywood has done its best to promote a light-skinned, North Indian type.) In their own countries, Europeans had placed the concepts of race and culture closely together. (Leading to numerous displays of viciousness, in Europe and in European-dominated countries without.)In my opinion, A person of European origin will not understand Indian culture, even modern Indian culture, without understanding a substantial amount about Hinduism. That is very hard. Hinduism is a very foreign religion to Europeans. Islam share a common base with Christianity as part of the so-called Abrahamic religions. (As a Jew I have a certain, quite unenthusiastic view about the relevance of this concept.). However, Hinduism, not at all. I should note that this is not any kind of disdain for Hinduism. I know that it is a very great religion, with a profound understanding of what it is to be a human. But it not a religion with just a few simple tenants, that outsiders can easily learn. Consequently, once that deceptive Persian overlay is removed, Europeans can have great difficulty in understanding what Indian culture is.Modern TimesThe establishment of the People's Republic of China was, very emphatically, the re-imposition of a highly centralized China, with a regime that says, this is what China is! The Cultural Revolution lead to horrors, but is was based on a few principles that were not that hard for Europeans to follow, whether they disagreed or not. The People's Republic of China has since adopted a less Communist approach to economic development, but, still, it is one, authoritarian voice speaking on behalf of the great Han majority. The regime tightly controls culture.And India, no, not at all. There is not one dominant racial group and none of the local languages completely dominates, not even Hindi. Also, we are talking of a democracy, an imperfect one (like some others) but still one where different people may speak. So, there is no one in India who can come forward and say, this is India, this is our culture. (Again, maybe Bollywood is by far the closest, but glamour film India no more resembles the real India that Hollywood films represent America.)I think there is a result. China is seen by Europeans as one great culture, with readily identifiable architecture, the ancient Confucian and Taoist beliefs, but now an anti-religious central authority on top of it. The People's Republic of China has chosen a relatively aggressive approach to celebrating the country's economic and military growth. I think many people of European origin are capable of separating the ongoing, ancient culture from the current policies of the Communist Party of the People's Republic of China. However, perhaps a certain feeling of coldness and threat has crept in.India has no such centralized image. It isn't really possible to identify one set of Indian beliefs, because Indians are permitted to express different ones. However, this means that India has no way of overwhelming outdated beliefs about its society and culture. The Raj had left an India full of poverty. The story of Indian economic growth, and the development of a consumerist Indian culture, isn't all that well known. The images of extremely poor India persist. The success of so many Indians in IT, and in academia, is somewhat known, but it can be difficult to “place” it in terms of the whole of India.I can see the Indian problem. The Government of India or other prominent Indians and Indian organizations cannot really assert a common Indian culture without being unrealistic and creating offence. Really, a European would have to get down to the level of Sikh, or Marathi, or Gujarati, or Keralan, or Tamil culture, etc., and study each.And, one byproduct of having a country that is not especially aggressive, is that others may not feel the same urgency to learn about. Personally I think this speaks well of India.But, that does not mean that “Westerners” like or admire Chinese culture better. The current behaviour of the Government of China is not positive to much of the European-origin world. People of good will, if anything, have to work at reminding themselves, that the real culture of China is not the culture of the Communist Party of ChinaIf anything I think India enjoys more good will from the European-origin world. But, images of Indian culture are rather “fuzzy”, because there is no single Indian culture, and because of old images that cling but are no longer so relevant. There is a vision of a democratic country, wilth many troubles but thankfully non-aggressive.I believe that Bollywood is currently what creates the most common cultural image of India throughout the world. Maybe that is not that bad. But, in any case Indians are in a situation where they can dialogue with each other and the European-origin cultures, and decide what they really want to tell the Europeans about themselves.Martin LevineWhy don't people want to work?February 5, 2019Well, what people are we speaking of here? They are all sorts of people who don't want to work.And, no, I don't think that a lot of them don't want to because social assistance (welfare) is better. I know people on social assistance. Despite our supposedly super generous Canadian social safety net (The one that scares the living daylights out of apparently, quite a few conservative Americans.) I know a fair number of people who have been on welfare, and its a fairly miserable way to live. Of course, one could supplement one's income by engaging in prostitution and selling drugs, but there is something of a downside to that.Also, the powers that be, certainly here in Ontario, and as far as I know, anywhere in Canada, won't let you go into welfare cruise control. They will monitor on and nibble on you, trying to push you towards a job in MacDonald's or Burger King. This will go on more or less until you reach age sixty-five. Canada has what it calls the Old Age Pension and the supplemental OAP for low-income people, but the governmental mainstay of retirement in Canada is the Canada (And Quebec) Pension Plans. However, if you haven't had good jobs and good incomes for the forty years that the Canada Pension plan defines as your working life, you won't get much from them. An OAP-only retirement is, essentially, poverty in old age.Going on disability benefits gives you bigger payments. However, you cannot just check in as disabled and coast. Disability is a provincial programme in Canada. The rules vary from province to province, but they will keep on checking to see if you have undisabled yourself. Particularly if your disability is mental, you will be subject to scrutiny. Having worked for the Government of Canada, the nuttiest people can hold a job there. (In fact, some would say that going mad is a defence mechanism that helps you survive. ) Really, the more psychopathic ones seem to thrive. So, you have to really work it, so as to assure the provincial authorities that you are keeping up the right type of mental disability to stay out of the workplace.They Knew What They Were Talking About In Hebrew SchoolBy the sweat of your brow shall you live! That is what Hebrew School in Winnipeg taught you in the 1950's. I don't recall a word about job satisfaction, or empowerment, or a fun workplace (I am sure there were no word for “Hottie” in Winnipeg in 1957, and were there any, it would have been highly condemnatory and implied dire violations of the Criminal Code of Canada.)I remember the teacher thundering away, so, the Garden of Eden wasn't good enough for you! Adam couldn't be bothered to patriarch enough, and listened too much to his Missus! So, now, go work! Labour your guts out in that Levantine field, and dodge the Philistines!You wouldn't normally try to grow grapes in a Canadian government office. (Unless you are employed by the Department of Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada.) However, Hebrew school gave me a firm mental take on work. That is, it is meant to suck, because G-d is punishing you. Who am I to question my own ethnocultural heritage? My Hebrew school life insulated me from some of the sillier pro-work talk that has been loaded on every generation since us Baby Boomers.You Want To See Punishment, I'll Show You Punishment!It is 6:30 AM on a workday morning, in early February, in Ottawa-Gatineau. It is dark. I look blearily out of my bedroom window, after confirming that most of my body parts are still more or less functional. That window faces the back of an old house. At the back porch they have an all-night light, illuminating a small patch of snow. And, beyond that little patch, the dark and dead winter world of a near subarctic city. Don't I feel so pumped, as I do my onset geriatric stagger to the shower!Since I live downtown, I get to walk to work. It is only fifteen minutes, on snow and ice set to break your ankle. However, think if you are a suburbanite. Unless you can afford the downtown parking (Big city prices for a little burg.) you take the bus. A lot of the time, this means, waiting a long while at the bus stop, an enormously low wind-chill factor, and stinging snow in the face.It's not good. It's not natural. People are supposed to get up when it is actually daylight. You almost feel you would be better off in that Middle Eastern farm field, harvesting barley with a scythe.I am not trying to glamorize that period between the fall of the Roman Empire, and the rise of the industrial British. However, even with the decline of developed world industrial work, we have to function in a working world that makes us live unnaturally. “Manic Mondays” gave the Bangles a good inspiration, but they had a real point. This is not how people want to live. Maybe it feels better in Los Angeles, but a whole lot of good stuff would have to happen at the workplace, in order to cancel the brutal circumstances of how you got there.Is Work Going Down The Tubes Or Are We Reverting To Normalcy?At least in much of the developed world, for at least a few decades after World War II, we saw occasional bursts in living standards, interspersed with occasional periods of recession, stagflation, crazy mortgage rates and stagflation. However, the new set of tail fins really did make you feel better, then the TV set, then the colour one, then the charter flight to someplace interesting or warm, and two cars, and grossly overprices electronic toys for the kids, and for the adults. It did keep you interested in getting up at 6:30 AM.And then, there were defined benefit pensions.But, what was the world of work before that, in between the world wars, and what it is now? The one percent used to be called the Robber Barons. The 1920's were kind of good, but, other than that, how much was there a trickle down? When the unions were stronger, they did force a somewhat more abundant trickle. But, it seems like we are reverting to the Hebrew sweat of the brow. Who is going to be enthusiastic about brow-sweating for the One Per Cent?Niche Work Enjoyment, But Not For Most Of UsThe workplace. A place for the team-player people person, huggy managers and enforce the hug Human Resources sections.Let us put up our hands. How many of us like it? Who would dare stand up and say, to the boss, the personnel folks, your fellow workers, that you don't want to know the? Who would defy the tyranny of the office extrovert? Personally, I like political correctness, especially because it gives me an excuse not to engage in casual conversation, with at least the females in the office.I am speaking of the emotionally intrusive workplace. I relate it to the rise of middle class values in the developed world's, world of work. If you are punching in to work on an assembly line, you can sneak a scowl or two, as long as the foreman knows you are building the cars right. Who cares about soft skills?To what extent has the middle class workplace become a more nicely furnished version of Big Brother? The cameras are certainly there, but George Orwell's point was, some party zealot, not even a computer, examining your expressions for a negative attitude. It doesn't matter whether they are looking through a camera or not, the zealots are out there.I would love to see a Canadian, middle class workplace, bill of facial rights. That is, leave my damn facial expressions and my body language out of it. What if your preferred emotional, visual presentation, is the old-fashioned, Winnipeg, Ashkenazi, they are coming to finish us off, cringe? So, I am getting my work done, you are never going to get to know me, because you can't get it and I don't want to tell you about me, and stop judging. Will no Canadian lawyer organize a class action lawsuit?He Is Being Negative For The Sake Of Being NegativeNo, I am not. Some of the happiest work place faces that I have seen are from people who run their own businesses. No boss, no human resources, zealot examiner? Maybe it is worth the twelve hour days.And, what are the excuses for not making the workplace at least a little beacon of satisfaction? What is stopping the increasing of the trickle? Why is there not the 2010's equivalent of bigger tail fins, and the classic washer, dryer, oven and range? (Even made in North America!)And, what is the justification for the people, people, human resources triumphant, pretend you like us, workplace? It has gotten to be too much. In my opinion, in Canada, there is a need for a workplace mental privacy bill. Even a grouch can do very productive work. Maybe we can build on political correctness and say, it includes, inspect me only when it is about how much I churn out.Life Sucks And Then You DieNo, I didn't say that. A close relative of mine did. However, we can build on that observation.One theory of life, that I believe is plausible, is that we naturally do a kind of algebra. We measure up the stuff that sucks against the stuff that doesn't, or at least doesn't have to. We can accept the things that have to suck, such as a death in the family, snow in June (I'm from Winnipeg.), earthquakes, dumb plot lines for Star Trek, etc.But, when stuff that doesn't have to suck, sucks, we rate it double negative. It is a big drain on the good things of life. The average, developed world worker, hasn't had much of a trickle at all since the start of the 2008 Great Recession. Enough of the workforce knows that there isn't any excuse any more, to get really surly about the world of work. Our brows are made to sweat too hard, and brow sweat gets to be all there is.I have the feeling that things are likely to get worse before they get better. There is a formidable range of media content, that I think, sometimes quite deliberately, is trying to keep us from noticing what is going on.In Canada, at least, I don't think there is any political party that really wants to deal with it. As I said in another Answer recently, maybe some technological advances will boost our economic productivity to the point, that even the powers that be will let us have some, instead of soaking it all up. I really miss the era of the expanding tail fins, the brand new washer drier, and getting more from work without somebody demanding you smile.Martin LevineWhat is the future of relations between Canada and China?February 4, 2019Not especially promising. But, what is the future of relations between the People's Republic of China and all the rest of the world?Is The People's Republic of China Coming Up On A Dead End?It isn't clear whether others should conclude, that the presumptive goal of the Communist Party of the People's Republic of China, is to make China a fully developed country. How do they see the value to them of a nationally-encompassing middle class? So far, they have been quite successful in convincing middle class Chinese people that freedom of commercial and consumption choices is good enough. But, that might be harder if most Chinese aspired to be in the middle class.I think enough of the current Chinese middle class is concerned enough about what would happen if the Chinese government became less authoritarian, that they are not prepared to press the issue of more democracy. If, for the sake of argument, the PRC decided to opt for democratic, multiparty, elections, the risk of very angry social class and regional politics would be very high. It would sort be a Trump base on steroids, with no tradition of democracy and civil rights, even to the extent that the base knows about it.There are also demographic issue about loosening controls on the movement of China's population. Some Chinese cities are already enormous. Loosening mobility controls on rural and small town people, and people in depressed regions, could trigger a rush to the coastal cities and some of the inland megalopolises. China has so far been relatively effective at avoiding the creation of favela or barrio-type districts in its cities. However, how long can they keep it up? Japan and South Korea have First World-type resources in order to maintain decent conditions in their huge cities. However, the big cities of China could face the creation of areas that resemble the most violent and crime-ridden parts of Rio De Janeiro.Are The Resources There?The People's Republic of China has a population of about 1,400,000,000. By contrast, the USA, which is of similar geographic size, has about 330,000,000. Are there enough resources in the world to bring general living standards in China anywhere close to the those of the USA? Maybe, maybe, it might be feasible to raise China to the general level of Portugal or Greece, but the Communist Party of China would have to show a great deal of finesse in order to set this as an achievable national goal. Are they prepared to show their population a picture of Thessaloniki, and say, this is our goal, let's go, under our dynamic leadership, we can do it!Can They Trade Enough To Get There?It doesn't look like foreign trade can carry the People's Republic of China all that much farther forward in their quest for maybe, Thessaloniki. China is aggressively pursuing various initiatives in the developing world. However, it won't give them significantly greater international markets. Most of these countries are poor and look to stay poor. Is the PRC trying to pursue much more than Imperial Japan's Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere? They probably aren't, in a region that has very limited physical or human infrastructure and no cultural connection with China. And, even before World War II, Japan was able to implement part of their plan by invading and occupying Manchuria, Taiwan and Korea. China is not in a position to launch similar invasions, not even in bordering countries in Asia, never mind in Africa.More Frustrated And More ResentfulCanada is already trying to cope with a process, within China, that is likely to get worse. It is partly a psychological one. that is a bitter reflection on a very long period of national humiliation. You have China that is looking for big wins in the world. It doesn't look like they can get them. I don't think the search for big wins is something that the Communist Party has to propagandize hard to the people of China. A lot of them want it.So, what do you do when you want those wins, really badly. Let's push! And, this is in a country whether neither the senior bureaucracy or much of the population has all that much intimate knowledge of the rest of the world. (Maybe, a little bit of an Asian USA, isolationist, but wanting to do some serious shoving in the world.)Pushing too hard just sets you up to fall down. All the pushing in the world won't get Meng Wanzhou out of Canadian custody any sooner. A Canadian understands that there is a legal process that has to run out, even if Justin Trudeau wants to do cartwheels in his office. Maybe the Communist Party of the People's Republic of China, and a lot of other Chinese people, sincerely don't. So, what do they do next?One has to hand it to Donald Trump, he is awfully good at using lies to turn no wins into decisive victories. (Just look at the USMCA, eh. The USA corrected NAFTA and got absolutely everything they wanted. They sure put Canada and Mexico in their place, didn't they!) I don't think that the Communist Party leadership has the skills to pull something like that off, yet. So, concerning Canada, there is little more that they can do than simmer. This isn't a good nexus for an improvement and intensification of relations between the two countries.What Is In It For Us?What more of value is there that Canada can get from the People's Republic of China? They sell us far more than we sell to them. Even in a more friendly, more relaxed environment, what else could we sell them? More tourism? More spaces for Chinese international students in Canadian institutions? China has some excellent technology, but Canada buying it will make the balance of trade even worse. And, then there are the security concerns. For most other things, we are competing to sell China what other countries can also sell them, maybe sometimes cheaper and better.If Canadians had any doubts before, I think of lot of them understand that bilateral free trade with China cannot happen. Maybe NAFTA-USMCA has helped us be more realistic about free trade with developing countries. The current American administration was boorish about what they had to say concerning Mexico. However, there is an underlying truth about workers in developed, high wage countries trying to compete with workers in developing, low-waged ones. For the foreseeable future, free trade with the People's Republic of China cannot happen.Any Canadian administration, of any party, has to ask itself, what more can we do with the People's Republic of China? There doesn't seem to be all that much more to improve trade, from Canada's point of view. And, how many Chinese people, at any level of society, want Canadian advice about their politics, their government or their culture? What good is the Silk Road to us? What international goals can we possibly share with the People's Republic of China?Back Off And Leave Them In PeaceIt is arguably a good time to for Canada to leave the People's Republic of China in peace. Sizable parts of China's population probably have sensitivities and pent-up anger, about China's relationship with the rest of the world, that Canada can do absolutely nothing about. We cannot predict what will happen if China's growth stalls out or even drops to a relatively low level. We don't know whether the Communist Party of China will be able to cope. In a system that hierarchical and authoritarian, China has to rely on the judgement of just a few senior leaders. Those few people may or may not have the judgement or flexibility to finesse China through the situation. But, whatever they do, they certainly will not throw in the towel and say, OK, let's be a democracy. They may even have good, defensible reasons not to do that.Both countries will have to absorb the hit about Ms. Weng. Canada's best approach is to let China blow off steam, even if means putting up with a Chinese Ambassador who emotes on about white privilege. (I suppose we could respectfully send the gentleman a polite, informative brief about modern, multiracial Canada, but, if he actually feels sincere about what he said, he is going to feel humiliated.)One thing Canada could do, is to show Canada is not a part of any crusade against the People's Republic. In effect, Canada would do what it did with Cuba, ostentatiously refuse any American leadership. We could talk loudly about Canada refusing any extraterritoriality of American laws and assert that any talk of military confrontations is craziness. The current Chinese leadership is probably rather set in its ways, but there will be an upcoming generation. Perhaps they will remember.It Looks Like Canada's International Preferences Do Not Involve The People's Republic of ChinaCanada seems to be emerging into a “take” on its international relations that is at least a bit coherent.Regarding trade, hopefully, the USMCA will survive Congress and any impeachments. Also, with huge amounts of effort, Canada has secured tentative trade agreements with the European Union and the non-China countries of the Pacific Rim. Yes, the American insistence on a warning (And, presumptively, some sort of action) if Canada launches wide scope trade talks with China, is humiliating. But, it is very unlikely that we would initiate them anyhow.And, Canada is still making something of an effort to oppose the growth of authoritarianism in the world and to oppose the further growth of lie-based, hysterical politics. The People's Republic of China will not help Canada with this.To the extent that China's relationship with the rest of the world, or at least parts of it, resembles a punch-up, Canada has no need to be part of it. China and the USA will have to deal with their rather foul relationship on their own. There is nothing at all that Canada can do about that. We have to wait. My guess is that, if the USA and China can work out anything that the government of the People's Republic of China can claim as more or less of a victory, than the irritants between Canada and China will fade. I think also that Canadian interest in China may fade too.China is a great, historic country. Even if all its population does not reach the level of Thessaloniki, it will still be a powerful force in the world. However, that does not mean that Canada has to do anything in particular “about” China. There are other parts of the world where Canada's trade prospects and its chances to exercise some positive influence, are a lot greater. I believe that once the current controversy about Ms. Meng settles down (Either she will be extradited to the USA or she won't.) it would be a really good time to let the dust settle, wait while China and the USA deal with their differences, and assure the government of the People's Republic that, if they really want to talk, we will be happy to listen.Martin LevineDoes classicism exist in your country?January 30, 2019Quite intense, in our Canadian courteous and understated way.The Merriam-Webster dictionary provides a definition of classicism at https://www.merriam-webster.com/.... Of course their definition is their property:“prejudice or discrimination based on class”Of course, one person's prejudice and discrimination might be another's merit and effort. Also, when does membership in an upper social class become an historic entitlement. When does membership in a lower class become an identity and a lifestyle, even a defiant one?We Are Squeamish, Aren't We?I believe that social class is, inherently, a social sciences term, particularly belonging to sociology and political science. The social sciences, at least in North America, are measurement-oriented. The measurements rely on identifying typologies. Maybe the most popular one is upper class, upper middle class, middle-middle class, lower middle class, and working class. “Working Class” traditional meant blue collar industrial workers and their families. However, in Canada, it would now normally include low-waged service workers. In the original, old fashioned socialism, one could talk about the lumpen-proletariat, the “spurious leisure class”, and the up-front, Soviet, “social parasites”.In a place like modern Canada, throwing terms like that around are kind of a social and political cannon. You certainly wouldn't see them in any reputable national news media. I think the only people who are really ready to touch it, are hard core conservative,s who do not hesitate to talk about nasty welfarists, like the iconic single Mom, multiple children by different guys, and get plentiful child support, crowd.So, the Canadian social science community is not going to rush into measuring these troubled waters. Any attempt at objectivity is too likely to shade off into hysteria.The Good Old DaysLabel throwers didn't hesitate way back when. Very shortly after British and European settlers usurped the land from its indigenous peoples, social class came flooding in. British Canada certainly had no hesitancy about recognizing, and endorsing, social class. France set up a seigneurial system, just as classist as it could be, an elite of administrators, land owners, clergy and a smattering of professionals, ruling in an authoritarian sort of way over the mass of peasants.However, both of these distinct societies were vulnerable to a type of class wobble. The British and French aristocracies had been around for a long, long time. Some of them were notably distinguished. They had a lot of social prestige. (You are kind of impressive when you are descended from people who have been top end since the Norman Conquest.) Also, they had a well-elaborated physical infrastructure of palaces, country homes, agricultural estates, exclusive schools, various museums, theatres and symphonies that they were the patronage of.A decision was made earlier on in the history of British Canada that made a class difference. No established church. In Britain, the Church of England was part of the ticket to be an upscale person.However, what does a prestigious upper elite look like when you are in the bush? I think what happened in British Canada was a grab for the brass ring, fairly modest folks from the old country playing, reach for the top. Generally, as soon as you had the money to build anything that looked like a Scottish manor, you were getting there. Do that in Toronto, and you could qualify for the grand national British-Canadian elite. Get yourself a business, buy some property, hobnob with the top bankers, drop some money into the University of Toronto, and away you go. You might never look all that classy, right to the day you died, but your grandchildren could put on lots of airs.What is now Quebec had a peculiar social class issue. The British conquest in 1763 ripped most of the top off the society, saving some senior clergy. Some parvenu businesspeople arrived from the USA and Britain and set themselves up at the social heights. If they were looking for veneration from those beneath, they were not going to get it. They may have been pleased with each other but the francophone majority did not see them as all that legitimate. (It didn't help that learning French was not much of a priority. Also, you are speaking of mostly Protestants sitting on top of devout Roman Catholics.) Slowly, slowly, the francophone population tacked its own secular elite onto the upper clergy. It really took until after the late 1950's and early 1960's Quiet Revolution, before they could push the stifling Anglo elite aside, and promote some socioeconomic heavy hitters of their own.Does Canada Have A Trash Elite?Some fairly greedy business folks, some senior federal bureaucrats, a few wannabe media stars, some government-contract seeking professors, do not a very convincing upper class make. Until the 1950's Canada was a rural-oriented country, and rural residents had limited access to information. However, Canada began to urbanize like crazy. A rush of American investment produced a new, prosperous class of branch plant managers. I think at some point a lot of cynicism set in, even before any populist rush. In effect, who do you guys think you are?It was an elite that couldn't do much of an upper class job. Since the 1960's we have seen the occasional spasm. Some new political ideologue, a hockey team owner, the head of a Royal Commission, the good old-fashioned, governmental “Mandarins”. If you looked at a biography, they were not necessarily impressive or distinguished. Above all they were not entertaining. (The British aristocracy serve as a vicarious playground, sexual improprieties, weird hats at Ascot, car crashes, some impressive dramaticism, and some of them still own tons of land.) An upper class can not afford to be boring. You end up with everyone else watching American TV shows, or teleromans, and forgetting to know their place.Everybody Wants To Be Middle ClassOur current federal governments insists on that. I don't think that a Conservative Party government would be in the least different.But, what happens to the folks down below, who are never going to make it? And, just who is this middle class. What happened to upper middle, middle-middle, and lower middle?Maybe we need the middle class non-specific fiction, so that people won't be humiliated even more than they are. Across urban Canada you see a process of division. I could use Ottawa-Gatineau as an example. After World War II, the growing federal government had lots of jobs that could earn you a duplex in the suburbs. You didn't need so much expertise back than. If you had a bachelor's degree or even less you were trainable enough.But, over time, that Ottawa-Gatineau slid. It got to the point where you needed quite a lot of education to get really good government jobs. And, the jobs that supported that post-war, humble, somewhat lower middle class, were not replenished.And, what happened to Ottawa's middle, middle? The government offices are not the same. You don't see as many middle middle jobs anymore. And how do you define the IT folks? Are they working class, or, if they are middle class, where do they fit? There are so many contract workers, with no job security. So, are you middle for a while, but your contract ends, and then, who are you?And what can you say about the middle class of the Vancouver and Toronto areas? What happens when a middle-class income can barely get you working class housing?I believe the classicism is there. The upper class and the upper middle class know about their social position. However, it is a really good time for them to shut up about it. Be vocal, and you turn over the keys of Ontario to Doug Ford.If We Don't Talk About Them, Maybe They Will Go AwayRead some stuff from Statistics Canada and you know there is a working class. There are plentiful low-income jobs, a lot of people who smoke too much and don't get exercise, and they have trouble affording decent food.When the private sector unions were stronger, there used to be more talk of the Canadian working class. But it isn't England here. Where is the class consciousness?It is hard to disdain people who are kind of hopeless, maybe sickly, and can't campaign for themselves. It makes you feel mean. Are you ready to say they deserve it? If you say they deserve better, just what do you suggest our different levels of government do about it? It is just easier to say, well, they all want to be middle class, and something will make it happen.Ethnicity And ClassMany years ago, a prominent Canadian sociologist called Canada a “Vertical Mosaic”. That is, some ethnic groups tend to be up the economic ladder, and some down. That could be a combustible situation. In Ottawa-Gatineau, for example, the lower jobs have historically tended to be done by French and Irish people. Do you want classicism to be the same as racism?And, the ethnicization of class may not be healing. Canada imports temporary workers to do jobs that Canadians are not keen on doing. Most of them are people of colour from the developing world. If they do the jobs well, why not please the employer, and let them immigrate?Do Not Say What You Are Thinking, Or Your Thinking Is ConfusedThink what you like at your golf and country club, but be politically correct and keep quiet about. it You are not that impressive, deep down you know it, and you could overturn your own apple cart.Also, who are you meant to disdain on? It is like a moving target. Some of the social classes that you would like to express your contempt on are diminishing or changing into something that is really hard to get. (What if the upper class recognized a new class of contract IT workers. What pigeon hole should one put them in?)Classicism exists, but, when you celebrate it in a place like Canada, it is a dangerous indulgence.Martin LevineDo you think the West is in decline, or are we just seeing a levelling of the ""chessboard"" of power?January 27, 2019I have come to feel that the concept of the “West” has become more of an obstacle to useful thinking than a help. The term is outdated.Originally, the West may have meant, principally, the Christian-oriented, well-developed countries of Western Europe, Britain, the United States and Canada. I think there has been a little bit of ambivalence about Australia and New Zealand, because of their enormous geographic separation from what, for want of a better word, you might call the “primary” parts of the Christian, prosperous, majority Caucasian world.But, above all, we see a challenge to “Westernness” from Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and Singapore. These are countries that are at a comparable level of individual and societal prosperity to the Caucasian, prosperous, Christian world. They all operate as democracies (Yes, Singapore has some restrictions, but they still have elections and an orderly police and court system.) How would one classify them? Are they a separate racial block of oriental people, who collectively have a set of goals? It doesn't really seem so. I remember that, during the 1980's, Japan was sometimes considered a threat, particularly to the general American predominance in the non-Communist world. That ended, I think because the Japanese economy ran into the limits of what can be done with a certain population and a limited resource base. It was almost the last gasp of World War II.What can we say about Russia? From the late 1940's there was the well accepted concept of the Soviet Block, reinforced by the Warsaw Pact. Within the Soviet Union, the Christian-based, Caucasian, Russia was combined with the Muslim-based, somewhat Turkic, Asian republics. Some other small, Caucasian, Christian units were also trapped within, the Caucasian soviet republics and the Baltic ones.So, what happened when the Soviet Union collapsed? A few of the countries of Eastern Europe stopped being so poor, and adopted more or less democratic systems of government. So, how would you now classify Poland, the Czech Republic, Estonia and Slovenia? Croatia is getting somewhat close, and, Slovakia, not so bad. You could call it an advance of the core, European West. Also, there is room for more. What if Serbia, Romania, Bulgaria, the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia and Montenegro were pushed past a certain GDP per capita or Purchasing Power Parity level? What if even Ukraine were? What if all these countries are incorporated into the European Union and NATO? Are they then allowed to sign the register of Westernnness? Should the Eurovision song contest be allowed to describe the outer limits of the European West? What do you do about Muslim-oriented Kosovo? What would be the status of Albania, if the local standard of living was pushed up and the beaches fully developed for European, charter flight mass tourism? That country is just a short distance from Italy.Say, as unlikely as it is, that Israel managed to reach a relatively stable peace with most of its Muslim neighbours. The level of prosperity and technology is relatively high. However, the culture is based on a religion that some Europeans have asserted, and continue to assert, is the antithesis of Christian European values, and the people are sometimes considered as only technically white. So, as a personal view, I don't think most Europeans would ever accept Israel as part of their West.The Latin American BrinkHere is this whole huge part of the world, from the Rio Grande to Tierra del Fuego. Enough Hispanic and Portuguese Roman Catholicism was imposed on the indigenous population to squelch much of their own culture. The populations of the southernmost countries of Latin America are, to some extent, Caucasian.Per Capita GDP in Uruguay is about USD 21,000. In Chile it is slightly over USD 15,000. In the European Union member Greece, it is about 23,400. So, if per capita GDP in Uruguay and Chile rises to the level of an EU country, what can we say about the Westernness of these two countries? Do we then consider them kindred souls of Spain, Germany, and Italy, etc., and subject to some kind of Western leadership?The “Developing World” Does Not Mean MuchI think the term “developing world” was designed because it was nicer than saying, poor countries. However, a lot of intellectual effort was put into establishing common definitions of what it, or “Third World” meant. Much of this had to do with feelings of guilt and shame, or academic revulsion, in the European countries that were the most aggressive colonizers. However, what can either term actually mean?To some extent they were political terms, developed to describe a part of the post-colonial, Cold War world. At the time it was popular, for some very real reasons, to think of these countries as potential pawns, disrespected victims in the power struggle between the Soviet Union and the United States. Ne-Colonialism was a describable, provable phenomenon.I believe that, once the Soviet Union collapsed, and the Cold War ended, at least in the old sense, the umbrella, developing and third world descriptions, lost their rational. The Western World was meant to be a foil to the Soviet and developing world. But, what can one say when the People's Republic of China has become such an active player in some of the poorer countries? Evidently it is not a Western country. The People's Republic of China still has relatively low median incomes. It is not Caucasian and not democratic. If there is some sort of East-West dichotomy, what is there to do with the People's Republic of China? How would you define a bond between it, and sub-Saharan countries that are not developing at all?The People's Republic of China is about one quarter of the population of the entire world. It is by far important enough that, it is appropriate to say, it is what it is, a unique entity. And, what if incomes for the largest part of the population continue to rise? The poverty link between it and the poor countries will be lost. China is “about” China and China's interests. Unlike the USA it has not been able to develop a sizable group of voluntary allies and partial cultural admirers. The Chinese dialects are not that simple that one can pick up a few hundred words of basic communication. The culture is very old, very unique and not transferable the way American popular entertainment products are.Refight The Turkish Attacks on Vienna And The CrusadesI commented on this in an Answer a few days ago. Much of the supposed confrontation between the West and the rest of the world is really about an old argument between Christian Europe, the Ottoman Empire, the Arab countries and Iran. Those countries have enough of the world's population and enough oil wealth (at least some of them.) that they can pursue a sort of angry cultural claim against Europe. That claim has nothing to do with the poorer parts of Latin America, the more Christian-oriented countries of sub-Saharan Africa, or Southeast Asia. I don't think it has much to do with the aspirations of the majority Hindu population of India and Sri Lanka. The claim does not seem to include the feelings of much of the populations of Indonesia, Malaysia or Brunei. Notably these are countries with relatively open, capitalist economies. Perhaps Indonesia's first President, Sukarno, had a sort of critique in mind, but he was deposed, and Indonesia eventually returned to a more capitalist model. When one considers the Islamic countries of Southeast Asia, it is apparent that there is no worldwide Muslim block against the West.If You Are Multiracial, Are You The West?I ask that as a Canadian. Over the course of a few decades Canada has become a multiracial country. The Cabinet Minister responsible for immigration is himself a refugee from Somalia. Three other Cabinet Ministers are Sikh. Relatively speaking, Canada is involved and friendly with the non-European world. So, how would you view Canada in its western context? Could you call it a “repentant” and “appropriately apologetic” western country? Under the current circumstances, would you really want to say that Canada is an unquestioning, obedient follower of the USA?Not Much of A Chessboard And Not Much of A ContinuumThe chessboard analogy was at its best during the Cold War. And, the world was seen as a sort of continuum between the prosperous, majority white, avowedly Christian USA, and the poorest, least democratic and most non-Caucasian countries of the world.A chessboard works with two sides only, and neither side is in a state of transition. This is nothing like the world today. There isn't any tidy way to characterize the world, but, maybe you could talk of the European Union, the USA, Russia, India, the more westerly Muslim countries, the southeast Asian ones, Latin America, the prosperous eastern fringe of Asia, the Black countries of Africa and then the dispersed, British-origin, Australia, Canada, Australia and New Zealand. If Britain Brexits, we are likely to see the United Kingdom as a partial free actor in the world, defiantly in resistance of American influence.The European Union still has some room to grow. A probably achievable boost in mean per capita GDP would turn Argentina, Chile and Uruguay into being relatively prosperous, predominantly Christian, Caucasian countries. Maybe they would see themselves as part of the value system of the Mediterranean parts of the European Union, but what allegiances they would have, we do not know.There is not enough of a coherent West that one could talk of it being in decline. In fact, it appears that the number of countries, with a more or less European Union personality, could increase. The United States is currently suffering rather more than it normally does, because of internal, severe cultural divides that have existed since well before the Civil War. This is, in part, because one man is exacerbating them. But stating that the United States is in decline is significantly jumping the gun. If one includes in the West, the prosperous democratic countries of Eastern Asia, they are not in decline. It does not appear that Canada, Australia and New Zealand are either. There is not any one Muslim world that is pursuing a common agenda.Can we talk of a levelling off? It does not appear so. Above all, we do not know what the future role of the People's Republic of China will be. The predictions one sees from economists range from sudden economic collapse to China becoming the biggest economy in the world, with general living standards as good or better than in the prosperous Caucasian countries.And, where do Russia and India go? What will happen to Russia when Vladimir Putin is gone? At the extreme end, what would happen if the next regime wants to pursue a less corrupt, more productive type of capitalism, with a functioning legislature? Do we end up with a populous, resource rich, European standard country?India's economy is growing and their proportion of the world's population may surpass that of China. Having lived in India, India will be India. I don't think they will align themselves with anybody else.And then, sadly, we have the non-white, poor countries that have limited power in the world and may continue to be very poor. This is mostly, much of Africa, parts of Latin America and some of the countries of the Caribbean. They are not levelling much of anything.So, you have a sort of matrix, not a continuum. A history of Christianity does not mean prosperity and power. Not all Caucasians live in wealthy countries and, even in them, not all are rich. Some of the Christian and European origin countries do not have a European Union level of prosperity yet, but may get there. A country can be culturally completely alien to Europe, and non-white, but still be prosperous and democratic and able to reach friendly relations and common goals with Canada, New Zealand and Australia. And, the USA has strong isolationist tendencies, and parts of the population have a strong disdain for anything foreign, even if it is Christian, Caucasian and prosperous. And there is no one, uniting Muslim approach to world relations.This isn't a chessboard with a sort of levelling off. If one wanted to compare the world to a game, it would have to have a number of powerful players, each with a potentially changing status, and a large number of other countries as small players, at various stages of winning and losing, or just losing.Martin LevineHow long will it take for US-Canada relations to improve post Trump?January 26, 2019It in part depends on how Donald Trump leaves office. If he has to step down, we do not know what Mike Pence will want to do during his interim period as President. In fact, how much do Americans know about Mike Pence's views on foreign policy?For the sake of argument, say Donald Trump were driven out of office, or outright arrested, around the middle of 2019. The USA would be very focused on starting the 2020 election campaign, immediately. To the extent that the election campaign dealt with foreign issues at all, it would focus on the Wall and national defence.The emotional environment in the USA would be very turbulent. Donald Trump's former base would be full of humiliation and anger. Despite Mike Pence's strong religious and anti-LGBT views, he will not at all resonate with that base. He is much more of a traditional Republican. I am not sure what the traditional Republican establishment, to the extent there is any left, could offer this disaffected group of people. Maybe, a continued angry and aggressive stance on foreign trade, but without slinging insults at various foreign countries and leaders, and with fewer outright lies or at least better crafted ones.It is going to be a different process, if Donald Trump is re-elected in 2020, and depending on who controls the Senate and the House of Representatives. It appears Donald Trump is running out his trade ideas. In his first term he came out swinging against Canada, Mexico and the People's Republic of China. It did not work especially well. If Congress agrees to the USMCA, Donald Trump may have little left to play with in terms of his North American trade relations. There does not seem to be much scope for more exciting quarrels with various other countries.Will Congress Awake From Its Trade Passivity?Congress has not yet passed the USMCA. If either House tried to reopen it, it would inflict even more damage on Canada's relationship with the USA. The next Canadian federal election us in October, 2019. The Liberal Party of Canada government is in no position to “give” more than it gave in the USMCA. I doubt that, if the Conservative Party of Canada won that election, they would be in any position to give more. The current trading situation with the USA is damaging the Canadian aluminum and lumber industries, which are strongly based in Western Canada, where the Conservative Party gets its core support. Also, the Conservative Party has made it clear that, if they were in office, they would strongly push for the construction of more pipelines from Alberta to Canada's ports, because Canada can get a much higher price for its oil overseas, than in the USA.Canadians get a lot of news exposure to the hostile, and sometimes profoundly ignorant sayings of Members of Congress. Even before Donald Trump leaves, will any group of Congress members seriously inform themselves about trade issues with Canada, look at the overall context, and elaborate any position about how to improve relations? My belief is that they won't. The expertise isn't there, nor is there any willingness to move beyond the foreign trade concerns of each individual constituency. Representative Pelosi now probably has sufficient authority to draw together a Democratic consensus, but there is very little sign that she has the interest, or is willing to prioritize relations with Canada in what is a very cramped agenda.The last couple of years has been an education in American civics for many Canadians. It probably is fair to say that many Canadians don't like what they see. It would be difficult to identify any single Member of Congress, other than perhaps Ms. Pelosi, that Canadians would see as knowledgeable, fair dealers, or even highly competent. I believe that a lot of Canadians, and certainly any Government of Canada, will continue to see Congress as a “tainted” player in terms of American relationships with Canada. This will continue to make Canadians leery and fearful.And, It Is About Americans In GeneralI do not think Hilary Clinton should have used the word “deplorables”. That is not appropriate language for someone who wanted to be President of the USA, and, supposedly, to try to do their best for everyone there. However, more than in the past, a lot of Canadians have recognized that there is a sizable part of the United States population that has an ugly world view, laced with racism, a lack of any real belief in democracy and a strong predilection for violence and bullying. Yes, they are nowhere near a majority and there are numerous well-intentioned Americans who believe in their own Constitution. But, during the Trump years the violent fringe of the USA has become much more visible and far more vocal.Canadians will not forget them even after Donald Trump leaves. The contemporary USA is not very credible as the leader of the “Western World”, and whatever it is meant to represent. I cannot suggest what would change that, and it isn't the purview of foreigners to solve it. Perhaps the USA could elect a higher quality, more able President, who has a much higher commitment to democratic values. But, a lot of Canadians are going to remember that the trolls and the lurkers are still there.Farther And Farther ApartIt is not just trading relations, as important as they are.I and other Answerers have mentioned a process of divergence between Canada and the USA, that seems to have started in the late 1950's. Essentially, Canada has followed the general British and European (And Australian and New Zealand) trend towards being a capitalistic social welfare state, with a strong commitment to international institutions. Like the others, Canada has become more secular.The USA has taken a quite different path. The nationalism was always there but it has become more extreme, with a tinge of anger and fear of the foreign world in general. There has been ferocious opposition towards the creation of the general social safety net that virtually all the other well off democracies have created. Despite the supposed separation of church and state in the United States Constitution, if anything, religion-based approaches to American civil issues have ramped up.The 1950's America was seen by a lot of Canadians as generally equivalent to the USA, (other than the massive racial problem), with attitudes and goals that many Canadians admired. That feeling is mostly gone. Obviously, Americans are entitled to choose whatever political stances they want, and fight for them. However, some Canadians now see the USA as ideologically alien. This is going to have a strong effect on upcoming generations of young Canadian adults. They will not remember any period of commonality and good will the way us Baby Boomers do. There is no real way to abruptly change this trend towards more distant, more alienated relations, not just with American governments, but about how Canadians perceive the American population that underpins them.As I have said in other Answers, personal friendships, and family relationships, between Canadians and Americans will go on. Particularly if the trading environment can be stabilized, so will friendly and mutually productive relations. Various American companies have billions of dollars invested in the USA, and vice versa. Local employment and labour laws get complied with. If a company in one country sends an expat manager to another, there will be professionalism. However, that is the private and personal sphere. Country to country relationships operate in a different sphere.Canada Gets Pushed Over A ThresholdI mentioned in another Answer that the Trump Administration has probably pushed Canada more quickly along a continuum that it was going to travel on in any case. Canada has a growing population, courtesy of immigration. The country currently has somewhat more than 37,000,000 people and is quickly pushing towards 40,000,000 and beyond. We are getting towards the lower end of the population size range for the larger European nations. Spain currently has about 47,000,000 people and Italy 61,000,000.Canada had 14,000,000 people in 1951, the year of my birth. In 1967, the centennial of the Canadian Confederation, Canada had about 20,500,000 people. When Canada had such a small population, it was normal in a certain way for it to be a client state. Originally it was a client of Britain. Then, probably during the Second World War, it became a client of the USA. This client status helped Canada with trade and defence. It kept Canada from being an isolated, weak country in the world.I think a lot of Canadians would have much preferred a more extended period of clienthood. It might have been better to delay Canada's ascension into being a mid-range country until, maybe, its population and its internal markets reached, say 45,000,000. But Donald Trump wasn't having any. So, Canada has been forced into being an independent actor. No Britain anymore, no America, just Canada, somewhat against its own wishes, speaking for itself, uncoordinated with anybody. So, we have to deal with Saudi Arabia on our own. Ironically, since Canada's issues with the People's Republic of China were the result of an American extradition request, Canada has to deal on its own with them too. Both countries saw Canada as a small, weak target, that can no longer rely on American support.Canada has been pressed into a situation that a lot of Canadians really didn't want, that is, saying no on its own. It is frightening and new, but what were the choices? No more training wheels. And really, the same for trading relations. Canada has closed tentative deals with the European Union and the countries of the Pacific Rim, on its own, no bigger country to stand behind us.I don't think there is any going back. Canadians are getting habituated to the new situation. They get saturation news coverage about it. There isn't any commentator who can tell us how we can get back to the situation as it was.Why Should Anybody In The USA Care?What interest does the USA have in Canada, in the immediate or foreseeable future? If the USMCA gets finalized, not much. Canada does not have much to offer to the USA than trade.Concerning its international relations, the USA is in an odd situation at the moment, apparently a growing return to isolationism, but a President who is an angry, aggressive, not at all well informed, internationalist.Except for emergencies, most countries are likely to prioritize their domestic affairs over their foreign ones. Whoever the next President of the United States is, to put it mildly, they will have domestic challenges to face. If they see themselves as a “healer”, they will try to emphasize measures that calm at least a few domestic waters. As Donald Trump has educated us Canadians, you cannot do it without Congress.Even if the next President wants to continue the current divisiveness, they will probably refine their targets, domestic and international. Let us face it, Canada makes a silly target. It is not important enough. It has no means to be a significant threat to the USA. Even with that type of President, Canada has a good choice to return to American benign neglect.I don't think Canada will be important enough to any American administration that they will really work at restoring the old relationship, which, in any case, because of the changes the USA has forced on Canada, will not come back. Congress certainly won't do it.In the meantime, Canada will continue to grow towards that 45,000,000 mark. From the point of view of any Canadian administration, “re-engaging” heavily with the United States is a bad political risk, when Canada is inevitably growing into being much more of a free actor in the world.Currently relations with the USA are at such a low that virtually any new President is likely to help. Relations between the countries can improve, but they will be something less close. There is no way to return to the situation that existed before.Martin LevineWhy do people on Quora discriminate us Muslims and Arabs? Why are they spreading lies?January 24, 2019I should explain that I have had some exposure to the Muslim world by working in Syria, Abu Dhabi, Pakistan and India. Ottawa-Gatineau itself has a sizable Muslim community.As I have said in other Answers, I wouldn't take all the comments one sees on Quora as typical. Quora attracts a lot of trolls and ignorant people. Also, depending on what country you are in, information about Islam and the Islamic countries can be very limited. News coverage we see in some countries is mostly entertainment. You can get higher ratings, and earn more advertising money, by making very emotional and threatening-type statements. Not that much news is in-depth coverage. We see the little sound bites and photo ops, repeated and repeated over a twenty-four hour news cycle. You will not see, for example, a half hour report on the daily life of an Indonesian Muslim family, what they have to deal with, how they see the world, etc.I cannot stress the lack of knowledge issue to much. Some hate attacks in Canadas that are meant to target Muslims end up attacking Sikhs. The bigots have such a low knowledge level that they believe that the wearing of a turban is the defining feature of all male Muslims.The Internet has enabled hate-ridden people to spew out all kinds of bigotry to a mass audience. They were there before, but you didn't have to hear from them.Bad HistoryWhile not that many people in Europe, North America, Australia and New Zealand have that detailed a knowledge of their own history, there have been historic incidents that have created a kind of, edge of consciousness,fear of Muslims. It goes back a very long way, as far at least as Charlemagne. Then there was the Moorish occupation of Spain, the two Turkish attempts to conquer Austria, the Barbary pirates, the Ottoman occupation of the Balkans and Greece, and a few others. I know that any Muslim with a detailed knowledge of the events could raise counterarguments and certainly cite the Crusades as an unprovoked series of barbarities on the Muslim population. However, except for a few academics, there is no one to debate about this.In more recent history there have been other irritants and anger points. I would include the British and French occupation of much of the Middle East after the First World War. Obviously there is the longstanding Israel Palestine issue. Of course there was the early 1970's Arab oil shock.But there is a deeper issue about the aftermath of decolonization. Obviously the creation of Pakistan involved a great deal of communal murder. But, there was a general problem in much of the Middle East. The decolonization ideology of the time tended to reject most “western” influences. It didn't work. Rather, it was a type of ideological colonialism. Much of the developing world was pressured to accept variations on the theme of socialism that were entirely based on the European experience. Some of these countries had become involved with the Soviet Union, and actively atheistic country.This was irrelevant to the Islamic and mercantile traditions of the Middle East. What if, for example, Egypt, Syria and Iraq had settled down with pro-business governments that, however, emphasized Sharia law as the guiding social force of society? Say, for the sake or argument, these countries had promoted foreign investment and technology transfer from the developed world, complimented by free trade agreements. Perhaps there could have been the core of a Muslim common market. Instead, there was economic failure and very angry populations. Local regimes were skillful at deflecting the anger on to the developing world. What the developed world saw were, great populations of furious and hostile Muslims.No Pure Religion Aside From CulturesObviously, there is pure Muslim theology, that is over and above the culture of any given Muslim population. However, how many people anywhere perceive their religion as being apart from their own culture?I mean no offence at all to the many different nationalities in the Muslim world, but here there is a rather strong tendency in the developing world to associate being a Muslim with being an Arab. Obviously Islam began in Arabia and the Koran is a great work of classical Arabic. The languages of other Muslims have absorbed large amounts of Arabic worlds.Unfortunately there are substantial numbers of Arabs who are angry at the European and American worlds. They do not actually have a lot of ways at lashing out. The Arabs, for example, do not have the means to organize an army to attack Europe and enforce retribution and reparations for the suffering inflicted on them during the Crusades, the colonial era and, for that matter, the neo-colonial period. There are only a few of the oil rich Arab countries that have enough money and the influence it can purchase to make real political pressures. In fact it is really only one, Saudi Arabia. The Gulf Countries, Kuwait and Bahrain simply are not populous and powerful enough. This has created a sad situation where the most visible Muslims are very angry Arabs (I am not suggesting they have no justification.) shouting threats, and sometimes, acting out by means of terrorism.By contrast, not that many people in the developed world know that Indonesia is perhaps the most populous Muslim-majority country, or that India holds far more Muslims then much of the Arab world together. Just think if one could deflect the angry Arab image of Islam towards Indonesians, making substantial economic progress, with industrial diversity, an improving infrastructure and a relative political stability.There is relatively limited knowledge of Shia Islam in the developed world. It is a serious obstruction to understanding the meaning of Iran. There is very little knowledge that the CIA undertook to overthrow Mohammad Mosaddegh, or how angrily many Iranians still remember that event. However, the impression of Iran can be, furiously angry, threatening, condemning people, with as regime that issues threats.I frankly doubt whether Turkey is helping much at this time to improve the image of Islam in the developed world. I have mentioned the historic anger at the Ottomans in Europe. There is really no point in contemporary Turks arguing that Ottoman Turkey has nothing to do with them. Unfortunately, a country which could serve as a bridge between Europe and the Islamic world, is not in a position to do so.Having lived in Austria, I see another dimension to the problem. Turkish people were admitted in large numbers to Austria as Gastarbeiter (Guest Workers). After a few years the Austrian government must have known that the “guest” concept was a fiction and that what had been introduced was a permanent resident population, which would have Austrian-born children. Instead, the Turks continued to be seen as a population to exploit. Of course, many of the Turkish migrants were people from the lower strata of Turkish society, who had limited means to devise integration strategies and argue their case.The result is a bad one. There are Turkish-Austrians who are among the hardest working people in the country, but who are viewed with disdain or as a threat. They have not evolved a leadership which can effectively refute those images and who can offer a plan for all of Austria to move on.Of course, Austria is not the only European society that exploits Muslim labour. The difference however is that, unlike the Turks of Austria and Germany, much of that population is illegally present with no rights. None of the mainland European countries has strongly endorsed multiculturalism. Of course France has many Muslims who have made an excellent adjustment to French life. But, there are the others, sitting in urban ghettos, without the means to move forward in French society, or that of the Netherlands, Belgium, Denmark, etc, also with no realistic strategy about how to move forward. Another angry, frustrated population without a defined pathway to integration.Islam As A Racial ReligionOf course there are thoroughly Caucasian Muslims. But, most are not. The United States probably has less reason then some other developed nations to resent Muslims, but the USA has its share of hard core racists. So, for that matter does Europe, and Canada and Australia are certainly not immune. It is not so much a hatred of Islam, but a hatred of the races that Muslims are meant to come from.So, Is The Hatred Inevitable?When one comes from a religion that strongly emphasizes justice, one might expect that the whole world would want justice. When one has grievances that may be very valid, one expects justice to deal with that.This is not the way of the world. Plenty of countries are internally unjust, or justice is very flawed. Or, certain types of justice, and its grievances are considered to be irrelevant. It is important to understand that, in many countries, the populations have rejected their own traditions of organized religion. How can you argue about justice for religious denominations, to people who consider organized religion to be irrelevant or outright dangerous? Or, especially in the United States, there are substantial populations of people who believe in the superiority of their own religions, and have little or no regard for any other.There is, perhaps unfortunately, little or no possibility of “engaging” the developed world about Islam. Also, really, that is not the issue for those who are hostile to certain countries or ethnicities who are predominately Muslim. If you asked them for their critique of Islam, for the most part they would have nothing to tell you. What matters is race, and populations who reject the developed world's economic system, or who are demanding redress for offences that others do not even know about. (Lecturing the Americans about the injustices that the French and British imposed on the Muslim world is nearly useless. Very few Americans feel any sense of inherited responsibility for those things.)If the issue is ethnicity and local cultures more than Islam, one should consider countries such as Malaysia, Indonesia, Brunei or Tanzania. They are strongly Muslim but they have very little in the way of a “hate profile” in the developed world. The issue is really more Arabs, as an ethnicity, who have particular reasons to feel intense anger at the developed world, and Iranians who feel similarly. It is also angry immigrants from the poorer Muslim countries, who have no clear path forward, no clear integration strategy for themselves and little or no strategy from the host country.These issues can not be dealt with by a religious dialogue, and better knowledge about the Muslim religion, in the developed world, will not help much.In order to improve the reputation of Muslims from countries who are in a state of opposition to the “West”, the racial, the economic and the cultural integration issues are what require attention. Again, there are very large numbers of Muslims who are members of ethnicities, and citizens of countries, that are not the subject of much hostility in the developing world and whose successes are not as well known as they ought to be.Martin LevineWhat happens today that would shock or disgust people in 1950?January 22, 2019It would depend what people you were speaking of. The 1950's were a special era in a few countries in the developed world, including those that were rebuilding after the Second World War.I believe that, in those countries, the 1950's were more of a special, exceptional period than the present. The United States, Canada, Australia and New Zealand hadn't experienced significant war damage. They saw a few years when the competition they would normally receive from Germany, France and Japan didn't so much exist. Then, towards the end of the decade, it was becoming apparent that those three countries were recovering their industrial capacity.However, 1950 itself was early on. Maybe it is best to focus on what would have shocked people in that particular year, were they to see the year 2019. (Of course, it would depend on how they saw it.) If you put someone from 1950 in a time machine, and abruptly brought them forward to 2019, they could be in shock for a variety of reasons. Would you give them a pre-launch briefing?In a few of my Answers I mentioned my favourite episode from the original Twilight Zone series, where, Martin, a successful businessman from 1959, inadvertently walks through a time warp, back to his home town when he was a kid. Martin (Gig Young) looked to about fourty or a bit more, so he would have been back in the 1930's. After some misadventures, he ends up having a talk with his Dad, who asks him, is it really that bad where you come from Martin? It would kind have ruined the drama in what was a very moving episode, but what if Martin had said, “Not really Dad. I will tell you about it. I am doing OK because of what you and Mom taught me.” Then he gives his Dad a briefing about America in 1959. If he and Dad walked back through that time warp, back into 1959, maybe with the upfront briefing, Dad, a nice man would not have been that shocked or disgusted.But, also, who are you talking to from the 1950's and what are you going to show them? Also, how future-oriented were they in 1950? Were they a science fiction fan? What if they were not a conservative middle class Caucasian? Say it was a gay person, hiding in fear in a 1950 closet, and you bring them to attend a Gay Pride parade in 2019, would they be shocked and disgusted, or just overjoyed? I am presuming that all these time travellers would have to return to 1950. Say you were a young, twenty-year old homosexual, you might be thinking, I just need to hold on and Stonewall will come. What if it is the science fiction fan, and you tell them about the space station and show them a picture of Elon Musk's latest space rocket? However, there is no colony on Mars, no human-like robots rolling around and precious few flying cars in the sky. Maybe they would be really disappointed.However, maybe we can identify a few 1950's realities that might startle a lot of American 1950'ites. I could throw in a couple of particularly Canadian examples, because there be some special shocks for my grandparents' generation, or even my Dad as the young man he was back then.Sex, Sex, SexThis is almost too obvious and the customary example that just about anyone would cite. Yes, there is much more overt sexuality in 2019, nasty words and references to previously unspoken body parts. So many of the women, particularly the younger ones, would look semi-naked. I suppose you would have to claim to be shocked and disgusted, although I suspect that, deep down, quite a few guys would be in seventh heaven.We know that there would be a something of a freak out, about young women being such “hussies”, or looking like “streetwalkers”, but what about male self-presentation?A lot of 1950 was about being a respectable civilian. It wasn't just the women who were expected to cover up anything. What if the 1950 guy was exposed to a 2019-ian with a “man-bun”, or even a beard? (Unless it happened to be someone who they thought was an “egg-head” or a “bohemian”.) In “A Streetcar Named Desire”, a guy in a t-shirt was working class rapist.And what about stuff like Speedos (R) and steroid-driven body builders (Particularly when bodybuilder magazines were fairly popular with guys that wouldn't dare speak their unnatural love.) What about white guys dancing around to hip-hop and doing shuffle dancing? Actually, I only date back to 1951, and, all this stuff makes me feel quite queasy.What would a 1950, Caucasian middle class woman think? Maybe like I do. She might ask, “Where have all the heterosexual men gone?”Yes, Of Course, RaceThis is the other obvious one. A Klan member from Alabama might be fairly horrified with the 2019 racial situation. A Negro was President! And there they are in management jobs, and living in the suburbs, and their music blasting everywhere. However, what would Dr. King think? I can imagine his face filling up with joy.What Actually, Would My Mom and Dad Think?These, evidently, are the people from the 1950's who I knew the best. If G-d would let me take them for a drive around the Winnipeg of the year 2019, while I was apologizing for a lot of things, I think I could talk them into not being shocked. My Dad was a businessman, and business still goes on in Manitoba of the year 2019. My Dad wouldn't speak his real feelings about young ladies in cut-offs with bare midriffs, because, if he did, my Mom would smack him one. I would make a point of driving them past the local synagogues and say, look, it is OK, it is all good!My Mom liked to shop. Big deal. So I show her what a credit card and a debit card are. I would tell her, not much in the way of cheques, and you do not need to go inside a bank anymore to get yourself some cash, but the stores are all conveniently packed together in this thing they call a shopping mall, and they are open until 9 P.M. and even on Sundays! My Mom liked a good restaurant meal. I think she would see types of cuisine she didn't know about in 1950 (I actually remember when pizzas first reached Winnipeg!) If I showed her Greek, Mexican and Thai places, she would have said, let's take a run at it.Wouldn't a lot of our Moms and Dads see it that way? We tend to focus on all the sex stuff, and different racial situations, but a lot of people were not centred on that. So, you tell them, the USA, or Canada, are still here, watch me plug my car into an electrical outlet, have a look at breakfast cereal in the year 2019 (They might think the organic stuff was kind of weird.), yes, the inflation is pretty bad but look what my salary is, and yes, the Russians are just as irritable as ever. So?I suppose some would say that the current United States Administration should do some shocking and disgusting. However, Joseph McCarthy was already up and running in the Senate in 1947. Would an American from 1950 be that impressed by this old-guy President? They might ask, has the English language changed so much or does he not know what he is talking about? They might see just another Republican nasty.Why Is It So Crowded?That might shock. Metropolitan Ottawa had about 312,000 people in 1951 and about 1,400,000 now. Nowadays the commuting really is disgusting. But, Ottawa is small potatoes compared to some place like Metro Miami, about 459,000 in 1950 but 5,502,000 in 2010, Metro Los Angeles, 3,997,000 and 12,151,000. That would shock and life could look pretty tough.What Happened To All Those Colonies?Decolonisation was in its early stages in 1950. A 1950'ite who was conscious of their geography might ask in amazement, where did all the empires go? What they thought about the disappearance might not be disgust.Also, Japan had been forced out of China only five years earlier. The modern People's Republic of China might be an amazement and seen as an awful threat.But there is an American and Canadian corollary, fighting it out in places you never heard of in 1950. You are telling me that America fought wars in French Indo China, Iraq and Afghanistan? (Canada too there.) There are terrorist threats from places that were utterly inconsequential back in our time? I think that would shock, and not so much cause, disgust, but rage.Some Others, Maybe Or Maybe Not A Big DealI know a definite Canadian one. What the hell happened to the National Hockey League! If I showed a 1950 Canadian all the American teams (Las Vegas! Surely you are joking!) you might see disgust.For Canadians, 1950 was long before the great French on the cereal box debate. I guess French language signage on federal buildings in Lethbridge might turn a few old-fashioned cranks, as in fact, they do right now!The working and single Mom families. And, women in the professions and business management. Would this be shock and disgust or a certain sadness, or just a puzzlement? How would we explain about the centrality of day care to Canadian life? What would your Mom as a young woman think?If your dad was kind of a jerk, she might be a little envious.In Canada, a much, much bigger proportion of all young people in university. Shock maybe, but not much disgust. And then, neither the students nor the rest of us get doctor or hospital bills? A happy shock.I Look Around My Living RoomIt is fun to do that when I think about my favourite episodes of the original Star Trek. So here is me. I am old. I am not all that sure that Winnipeg in 1950 was that different from Winnipeg in 1955, when I sort of started to notice things.They already knew about TV in 1950. They had envisioned rockets to the moon. In Canada we hoped our scanty population would grow. I guess I would not get what my cable box and my Internet modem were. The rest of it might look a bit different, but a kitchen tap is still a kitchen tap, a door is a door, a bed is a bed, with sheets on it, and a chair is a chair.I do the same when I walk around in downtown Ottawa. A sidewalk (pavement) is still recognizably a sidewalk, a traffic light is still recognizably a traffic light, and you could identify a car as a car, a truck as a truck and a bus as a bus.I think we overemphasize shock about the sexy stuff. You would learn fast. It doesn't mean that you, as a male, have better access. And, unless you are really hung about race, I don't think a multiracial Ottawa is going to traumatize.Maybe a 1950'ite might be shocked about how recognizable things they are. Unless they were really opinionated in 1950, and very scared of change, I do not know how much disgust they would feel.Martin LevineWhy does Canada have fewer problems than the United States?January 10, 2019I am not so sure it does. To make a comparison, you would probably have to do assemble complete lists of all problems, in the USA and Canada, weight them and compare them. That would probably be depressing.A country having problems doesn't mean that the people in it do or don't. At an individual level, lots of Canadians have problems, of different kinds, but some, not so much. Canada is very diverse in ethnicities and lifestyles. Say I were back living in Winnipeg, with an upper middle class income, in a really nice area (Yes, Torontonians, Vancouverites, etc., Winnipeg has very nice areas. The city has a bad reputation it really does not deserve.), an SUV with an extended warranty, a synagogue around the corner, a golf club membership, a cottage on Lake Winnipeg, and enough money to blow on an occasional junket to Las Vegas. Maybe life would not seem all that problematic. However, if you were a very poor indigenous Winnipeger, and could only afford to live in a nasty part of town, my paradise-Winnipeg does not exist for you. You have lots of problems.As usual I am going to talk about English-speaking Canada. The francophone Canadians are sometimes very different, and there is more than one group of them. Looking at it from outside, francophone Quebecers, or at least those who are descended from the original French settlers, seem to have an almost family level sense of involvement with each other.The Interface Between My Problems And Political And Societal ProblemsI am not aware of any statistical evidence, but my somewhat educated guess is that Americans tend to identify with the USA's political and social problems, and incorporate them personally, more than most Canadians do about Canada's issues. To a certain extent, the Canadian philosophy about government is “Run sufficiently right, and work at leaving me in peace.” Canada is a binational and bilingual country. (Maybe multinational and multilingual if you respect the rights of Canada's indigenous peoples.) It is also very regionalized. You cannot really say, “This is how a Canadian ought to be, and it is the government's job to enforce it.” So, if you see another Canadian doing something you don't like, it is really not a slap in the face to your personal beliefs and values.There is another factor that disengages English-speaking Canadians from being passionate about whatever problems they think their society has. As I have said before, we are not too sure there is one. English-speaking Canada has very little, in a formal way, of political or social incorporation. There isn't any Parliament of the English-speaking Canadians. There probably was more of a consensus when most English-speaking Canadians were of British origin, but those days are long gone. I cannot recall any debates in recent years about what it means to be an English-speaking Canadian.Canada's demographic base has been massively reworked since the 1950's, both by immigration, rapid urbanization, and plunging birth rates. It would probably be many more decades, before I could point my finger at another English-speaking Canadian, and say, “I know what a real English-speaking Canadian should be, I say you aren't, and you have no business thinking different from my ideas, so I hate you.”It Takes A Lot Of Time To Build Up An Historic HateEnglish-speaking Canada is a much younger society than the USA. It only got started in a big way after the end of the American Revolution, in 1783, when Americans who had remained loyal to the British crown fled the new USA, some of them into what are now Ontario, Quebec and Atlantic Canada. Britain expressed its gratitude to these United Empire Loyalists with free grants of farmland, of course stolen from the indigenous peoples. What was then the bush, in Ontario and parts of Quebec and Atlantic Canada, was far off being an easy place to settle in and live. It took a few decades to build up much of a population. Canadian historians sometimes say that these Loyalists were the real base of English-speaking Canada's culture, but that culture mostly ran out of steam after the great demographic shift I describe above.It can take a while to develop your society, so that you can create stereotypes of people, identify the bad ones, and start to personally hate on them. Of course, it also helps to have mass slavery and a extreme bloody Civil War.Canada's climate is not much suitable for plantation agricultural. Slavery was banned throughout the British Empire in 1833. The problems that the USA has had with race, that have been so much incorporated into the problem views of individual Americans, did not have a chance to happen here. A lot of the indigenous peoples were imprisoned on reserves. The unapologetically racist Government of Canada restricted Chinese and Jewish immigration. Canada has no border with a developing country, so there was little potential for a large, cross-border flow of different-looking poor people who spoke another language. There wasn't a very good supply of “others” to fear.Canada, The Go With The Developed World Flow CountryCanada does not have much of a philosophy of exceptionalism. It was really difficult to develop one one when British-Canadians felt such a strong feeling of common identity with the rest of the British Empire. In terms of national constitutions in the developed, democratic world, Canada's constitution is not very particular. It does that much not resemble the American one, which so much prioritizes individual rights over collective ones.So, after the Second World War, when Britain, Western Europe, Australia and New Zealand were developing their welfare states, so did Canada. No welfare state is perfect, and, yes, some of the most extreme personal rights do not exist, but they do tend to get some of the social safety and security job done. So, there you have it, the “social safety net”, unbilled health care, subsidized higher education, subsidized housing, laws about required vacation days and annual leave, and about maternity leave, and now, paternity leave.I would not claim that Canadians get any of this for free. Like in most of the developed world, taxes are high. However, if an important national goal is to lessen the fear and anxiety level about life, it tends to work. In some ways one can admire Americans for so much defending their personal freedom. But, take it to the extreme, and a lot of Americans have to pay the emotional price.There is also another dimension of problem-feeling where Canada went with the trend, and the USA didn't. That is, the decline in formal religion. Canada went with the developed-world trend. The USA didn't. Part of the job of religion is to create a fear of retribution, if you do not lead what your religion describes as a moral life, and fear of sinners. In Canada, and much of the developed world, those kinds of fears have become muted.Your Problems Versus My ProblemsIn terms of a problem-ridden life for the nation as a whole, different nations go up and down. Also, some societies are better at denial than others. The USA of the 1950's presented itself as a very successful place, and a lot of the people in it were doing well. However, large numbers of Americans who were not doing so well, or at all well, got swept under the social rug.At the moment, I think one thing American conservatives and American progressives could agree on, is that the United States, and a lot of the people in it, are not doing well. Of course, they are blaming each other for the situation.But, I have to admit, Canada is no slouch at rug-sweeping either. Part of the reason Canada seems to have less problems, currently, than the USA, is that some dire ones get limited attention. I could list a few:-Unless you happen to live in a place with a large indigenous population, particularly an urban one, the problems of individual, indigenous people are not much recognized at the national level. Instead, at the national level, there is plenty of self-serving political talk about treaty rights, and rural reserves being the basis of “nation to nation” discussions between indigenous nations and the federal government. Urban indigenous people, who are now numerous, keep on suffering.-Canada is facing a housing price crisis in two of its largest cities, and the problem seems to be spreading. However, banks get to give out huge mortgage loans, and retail banking in Canada is dominated by five, politically powerful banks. The real estate community doesn't that much dislike the current situation. And, the lives of Canada's senior bureaucrats and senior businesspeople are very removed from those of most other Canadians. So, if you are a working class or even a middle-class Canadian in Vancouver or Toronto, and you need a roof over your head, suck it up and go live in a basement.-Individual Canadians are running historically high levels of debt, while Canada has been through years of stagnation in income growth, except for people who are already rich or well-off. I rather firmly restrict my credit card purchases, but, if I was nearer the average debt levels, I don't know how I could sleep at night. However, people do not want to talk about their finances, and commercials in both the traditional media and the Internet tell us we need to buy a lot more stuff.-If a Canadian would like to keep their sanity, they might want to limit their viewing of international news. In terms of its economy, Canada is a relatively small, very foreign trade reliant country. It is also weak in terms of its international influence. Currently, if it is not the United States President and Administration ragging away on us, it is the People's Republic of China or Saudi Arabia. It has got to the point where Canadians could say, “Make the world go away, get it off my shoulder.” However, it isn't especially Canadian to talk publicly about your deepest fears and feelings. You wouldn't necessarily say, that you are having nightmares about Donald Trump pulling the plug, and your job going up in smoke.Drama Versus CanadaBe honest Americans, a lot of you like your political excitement. America's political dramatists tend to talk loud, exaggerate and get better ratings for the advertisers. A lot of the excitement is driven by big money and very well-funded lobbyists.In Canada, not really. Some of the calm is the result of a lack of mass media markets. It takes big money to make up those convincing TV commercials about the catastrophes to come.You are unlikely to get rich in Canada being a media pundit. You won't get to transfer your career to being a talk show star. And, in English-speaking Canada, who can you identify as the face of evil, violating our national values, when we cannot identify just what those values are?The Problems That Scare You In The DarkEverybody has some personal problems Canadian, American or whoever.But, in terms of a country's problems, and how they effect you, the individual, there are some differences between Canada and the USA. Americans tend to personalize national and societal issues, in a way that Canadians don't or can't. Canada, as a country, obviously has problems. However, when Canada went along with the trend in the developed world, to be a welfare state, some of the national problems were partially solved. It is more of an issue to maintain what was created.The United States still isn't at peace with the welfare state solution. This leaves some political and social issues still problematic, in a culture that tends to emotionalize.In Canada, it isn't so much the problems that get dramatized on talk shows that worry people. It is the ones that plague you privately when your day winds down, it is night, and there is some time to think. You can worry a lot about your credit balance, the rent you can't afford, and the newscast you saw, about how your job might evaporate at the stroke of a foreign pen. There isn't the face of any particular public figure on those problems, your fears do not make you a member of any tribe, and you don't know if anybody of importance really knows or cares.Martin LevineWhat are the major differences between American and Canadian cities in terms of their urban form?December 27, 2018After I read this question I asked myself, just what is urban form? The definitions seem to be more or less inclusive. However I found this definition in a March, 2015 research briefing from the British RTPI, at:https://www.rtpi.org.uk/media/13...Of course the paper is the property of RTPI. RTPI stands for the “Royal Town Planning Institute”, which, as I understand it, is an influential organization in the United Kingdom.“Urban form is defined as the physical characteristics that make up built-up areas, including the shape, size, density and configuration of settlements. It can be considered at different scales: regional, urban, neighbourhood, block and street. Urban form evolves constantly in response to social, environmental, economic and technological developments; planning, housing and urban policies; and health, transport and economic policies.”This definition seems like it would fit well with the Question.As I sometimes do when Questions ask for comparisons between Canada and the USA, I am providing my “no Canadian superciliousness” guarantee. I have been to American cities that are really liked. I am not arguing on behalf of some sort of Canadian superiority. Canada is a foreign country from the USA. It is not necessarily the case that the cities here are going to be all that comparable to those in the USA.It All Started In BritainI recently stated it in another Answer, a concept that the RTPI would likely be pleased with. There is a town plan for cities in the British origin world, including the USA, that originated in Britain, that is a little different from some other models in use in the rest of the world. I lived in Britain for a few years and saw it myself. You have a residential street, with houses with front and back gardens. Shopping and other services are confined to the High Street, which is the same as the Main Street. If you want to go shopping, you walk a certain distance and “Go down the shops”. It is so little different from cities in Canada, the USA, Australia and New Zealand that there is very little culture shock to go around.The biggest difference is that, Britain doesn't have much land to work with. Australia did, and apparently that is where urban sprawl got started. You make the homes have more square footage and the front and back lawns much larger. This gets the residential streets so stretched out to the point where you have to drive rather than walk. The next step is the shopping mall. This isn't so easy to do in space-challenged Britain, although they sometimes manage:https://www.brentcross.co.uk/This is the Brent Cross Shopping Centre in northwest London. I have been there. Except for the cute British accents, you wouldn't know that you weren't in suburban Calgary.And, in the British-origin countries, where there is plentiful land, because it was stolen from the indigenous peoples, there are shopping centres galore.And, then, the downtown. It is significant that when the British singer Petula Clark sang about it, the British people knew just what she was talking about.I lived in Europe and it is different. Residential and business areas are not very distinct. There is street after street of four and five story apartment blocks and various businesses on the ground floor. It is very compact. Rather than downtown versus the suburbs, it is arrondissements or Bezirks versus each other. So, an inner city arrondissement is also a residential area, not just a central business district, sometimes a prime one.No Sunbelt Paradise In The SubarcticOne could talk about city types in the USA, although a matrix-type comparison might be more apt than a lineal one. Some variables:-Hot versus cold.-Desert versus adequate moisture.-Old versus new.-Rust belt versus viable employment base.-Traditional industrial base versus high tech.-Huge, world class, versus medium-sized, versus not so big, versus small.-Very dominant upper class versus not quite so much.-Tourism and recreation are important versus flyover.-Conservative fiscal and social principles versus liberal ones.It is not the same in Canada. An urban description matrix here might include:-Relatively close to other urban centres versus very geographically isolated.-Very much effected by immigration, versus not so much, or not much at all.-Medium sized, to smaller, to a small town having to function as a city.-Very ample space city, versus constrained space city.-Older city, versus recently emerged city.-English-speaking, versus French-speaking, versus bilingual city.-Ocean and lake transportation city versus ground transport city.-Very high housing cost, versus more moderate housing cost, cities.The Image of American CitiesLooking at it from Canada, there is a sort of overall image of an American city. Canadians visit the USA a lot, so a lot of the stereotype is based on observation.So, you have a central business district with very high skyscrapers and some historic buildings from the nineteenth century, well preserved if it is a well-off city, versus derelict, if it is a city that isn't. Then, the ghettoized inner city residential areas and so the white flight to the relatively safe suburbs, even to gated communities. So, basically, it is a “donut” city, with even some of the business functions moved out to the suburbs.A prosperous, world class American city might have a few prestigious areas near the CBD, such as the Upper East side of New York City and Georgetown in Washington, D.C. At the outskirts, near the Interstate highways, there are many shopping centres, factory outlets and big box stores. (Canadians notice these a lot, because often we have come to shop, and are driving on the Interstate, and are looking for the right exit that gets you to the city's biggest shopping mall.).To us, an American city is very big. A city with a metropolitan population of 1,000,000 people is nothing at all special. In Canada only a few metropolitan areas are that big.An observant Canadian would notice. Many American cities devote land to river, lake and ocean transport. The infrastructure includes bridges and tunnels. Those cities tend to be the biggest ones. In Canada there is a division. On one hand there are cities on the Great Lakes and Saint Lawrence River system. Then there are some oceanic ports, some quite small. But most of the rest of Canada does not have navigable river or lake systems that could support trade. None of the Prairie cities do, nor cities in the British Columbia Interior, not in Ontario, outside of the Great Lakes, none in Quebec that are away from the Saint Lawrence River, and none in the inland parts of Atlantic Canada. Most Canadian rivers have rapids, flow north towards the Arctic or are frozen for a number of months a year. Land has to be devoted to railway tracks (My Winnipeg is an extreme case.) and roads there are plentifully wide to accommodate the biggest trucks.A Canadian with sufficient holiday funds might also see America's “sun cities” as being in a special category, that does not exist here. Some place like Miami, Phoenix, and San Diego have hotel districts, either downtown or on a beach. There may be seaside parks and boardwalks, or a lot of land devoted to golf courses. Canada does not have the equivalent.What Canadian Cities Aren'tCanada didn't become very much urbanized until the 1950's. There were never big, industrial cities that turned into a rust belt. There are not any cities with large derelict areas, like Detroit, or Gary, Indiana.Canada does not have urban ghettos in the American sense, except sort of for cities that have large populations of indigenous people. (Again, my Winnipeg is an extreme case.) There wasn't anything equivalent to the American urban riots of the 1960's. Even in the case of Winnipeg, indigenous areas are not derelict. Native people tend to live in small, old, wood frame homes, and public housing. There is a move now to urban reserves. Many of Canada's indigenous peoples are recognized as being members of their own nations. The urban reserves are permitted to have some self government.Frankly, inter-ethnic residential choices are not so much driven by fear, as by distaste. And, it is not just distaste for non-white people. It can be distaste for Mediterranean and Jewish people as well. It is more of a question of, why would I want to live in their neighbourhood? Few Canadians are allowed to carry handguns. You don't need gated communities, just prestigious and more “old stock Canadian” ones.Having these sorts of Canadian neighbourhoods is sometimes augmented by plentiful sprawl room. For example, in Toronto, if you do not want to involve yourself with Italian, Greek, Jewish, Chinese or South Asian neighbourhoods, you can go and live in a more traditionally Canadian suburban town, as much as eighty kilometres (About fifty miles) away.Having said that, Metropolitan Vancouver, Canada's third largest metropolitan area, is geographically very constrained. They are near the end of their available sprawl land and Vancouver is very ethnically and racially diverse. We will see what happens.Some Canadian cities are geographically quite isolated. There is no bigger city to drive to, so if you would like to visit a museum, or an art gallery or see live theatre, (And flying domestically in Canada is very expensive.) it has to be local. Cities will have artistic spaces, prominently and proudly displayed, right downtown.Metropolitan Toronto and Metropolitan Vancouver have no equivalent to relatively moderate housing cost areas close to the city centre, such as Brooklyn, or Skokie, Illinois. Both cities are extremely expensive, right across. Constantly, the outer suburban towns are being heavily built up, not just by traditional Canadians fleeing diversity, but by people who cannot afford anything closer in. An excellent example is Barrie, Ontario. It is eighty kilometres (fifty miles) north of Toronto. The 1961 population was 21,169. The 2016 population was 141,434. However Barrie is now recognized as a Census Metropolitan Area. The 2016 CMA population was 197,059. Barrie is a nice place. However it isn't so much people who love the environment. It is whole lot of people who couldn't afford to live any closer in to Toronto.There is another spatial issue around Barrie-type developments. Canada does not have the equivalent of the federal system of Interstate Highways. There are no city-loop expressways, not even to downtown Toronto, Montreal or Vancouver. This has done a lot to preserve downtown areas. It also means that there have to be robust public transportation corridors into the city centre.Quebec Is A Little DifferentMontreal and Quebec City both have old, heritage areas in the city centre. Otherwise Quebec cities are not spatially too different from other Canadian ones. However those heritage areas are part of the national identity of the Quebecois. They are more or less sacrosanct.New And Tiny CitiesI mentioned Barrie. There are a few other examples, similar suburban towns around Toronto and Vancouver. In 1961, Kelowna, British Columbia, in the interior, was a small town, 13,188 people. However, it became a retirement and escape Vancouver magnet. The city proper 2016 population was 127, 380. The current metropolitan population is around 200,000, virtually all-new buildings and suburbs.I should explain that a population of 200,000 makes a Canadian city of some note. It is not a small town.A particular Canadian urban centre is the tiny territorial capitals. There is Whitehorse, Yukon, somewhat over 25,000 people, Yellowknife, in the Northwest Territories, about 20,000 and Iqaluit, Nunavut, about 8,000. However, these three communities do not resemble small-town America. They have the territorial legislature and government buildings, the major hospital for the whole territory, most of the federal offices and quite substantial airports.It Is Just DifferentAs I said, it is not superior Canadian cities versus inferior American ones. The Canadian urban circumstances are just very substantially different. Canada has its own urban issues to solve and the USA, different ones.Martin LevineWhat is your opinion on people from Russia? Not their government, just the individuals who live in that country.December 18, 2018My experience with Russia is two temporary duties of two month's length, in the 1990's and 2000's, when I was in the Canadian Foreign Service. I would have liked to see Russia outside of Moscow, but the travel infrastructure for single travellers who didn't speak Russian was minimal.My grandparents were from the Russian Empire, from Moscow itself and what is now Belarus. I think this effects how I see Russians, although we would have considered ourselves Russians Jews more than Russians.Also, I grew up in Manitoba, which you could describe as an East European positive environment. Thee are many people there who are of Ukrainian and Polish origin. Also, the physical environment resembles much of Russia rather strongly. The southern part it mostly a steppe, then moving northward the boreal forest, or taiga as it would be called in Russia, and then the tundra. Winnipeg, my home town, has a climate similar to that of Novosibirsk. We see extreme cold and interminable winters a certain way in Manitoba, that most Russians wouldn't find too hard to understand.Who Is A Russian?The modern Russia is predominantly a country of people of Slavic origin. However, there are Russian citizens who are not Slavs, Jews, peoples from the Caucasus, Tartars and the indigenous peoples of Siberia. As nearly as I could tell, there isn't a uniform opinion in Russia about who is in and who is out. More tolerant Russians might say that, if you are fluent in Russian, and act Russian, you are in. Others might be more ethnocentric.However, the Slavic Russians are rather unique among Caucasians. There does not seem to be much evidence about who was in Russia, before the Slavic ancestors of the Russians were. In European Russia, Russians are almost an indigenous people. It isn't the same as in much of the rest of Europe, where there was a great migration of peoples after the collapse of the Western Roman Empire. My impression is that many Russians see themselves as the true indigenous people of the land. Maybe that effects how Russians see their land, somewhat more like the indigenous peoples of Canada than the descendants of white settlers. The Russians do not seem to recognize any predecessors, the way West and Central Europeans see the Gauls and the Celts.The Slavs who settled to the west of Russia apparently migrated into the region from what is now Russia. They arrived there hundreds of years later than the early Germanic peoples who eventually established their own languages and influenced some of the Latin dialects that became the Romance languages. As I understand, the Slavic languages are considerably less differentiated. The Russians seem to see their culture as the ancestor of the other Slavic ones, kind of as if the original proto-Germanic people had somehow hung on. I think it leads to a little bit of fuzziness about where some Russians feel their identity and culture stops. For example, in the case of Ukraine, some Russians visibly don't see their identity and culture stopping at the border, and not even just for Ukrainians of Russian origin. Rather, kind of like how some Americans see Canada, they don't see the Ukrainians as being different enough to have a legitimate claim on being different.The Russian House On The HillThe Russians have something very much in common with the Americans. There is a very strong belief in Russian exceptionalism. This is a belief that Russia is a unique, special nation that legitimately plays by different rules. Also, I think that a lot of Russians want their country to be a “house on the hill”, a beacon, an exemplar or just values, to other nations. Perhaps there is a feeling that, we must be doing something right to be here several thousand years.The Same Ethnicity In Such a Vast RealmRussia is still the world's largest country in geographic terms. It is an absolutely huge country, vastly different in scale from any of the European countries to the west of it. And, predominantly, it is a country to serve one ethnicity with a common origin. It isn't like the second tier of relatively vast countries, Canada, the United States, Australia and Brazil. Russia is not a melting pot. It is the national effort of one culture and one mutually self-identifying group of people.I found that the Russians had a lot of pride in this. You can fly the enormous distance from Moscow to Vladivostok. When you get there it the same language and people, mostly the same values, the same building styles. From the Russian point of view, they have kept it all together. They have fought two World Wars, in which they succeeded in keeping others off their vast terrain.The Prestige of Central RuleI believe this is very deeply set into the mind of many Russians. Since the time of Ivan the Terrible they have learned, a very strong national leader is what keeps you safe. To them, that, really, is the reason why the foreigners were repeatedly driven out. It doesn't matter that much what the ideology of that leader is. It could be Ivan the Terrible, Lenin or Stalin.I think this leads to a communications problem between Russians and people some of other nationalities. It is not effective to lecture Russians about human rights or democratic values. If you wanted to engage with them, you would be better off to ask, how can Russia always be assured of a powerful leader, who can ensure that Russia is so mighty, that no one would ever dare attack Russia again? If a Russian wanted fairness in front of the law and protection for individual Russians from the excesses of bureaucrats or gangsters, they first need to answer this question in their own minds. How can we have these things but not undermine the power of that essential, all-defending leader?A Type of Gratitude That Is Very RussianWhen your ancestors have been that long in a given piece of land, you see that land differently. You honour that land. You are grateful to be a part of it. I think a lot of Russians have a special type of spirituality about their land.And they are still grateful for it, although for the most part it is a harsh to extremely harsh land. A popular Quebecois singer had a song that said, “Mon pays, ce n’est pas un pays, c’est l’hiver .” (My land is not a land, it is the winter.) I think a lot of Russians would agree, and they embrace it.As a Manitoban I think I can get it. How do you feel about growing your food in such a harsh place, with such a short growing season? Your farmers are always trying to beat the first frost. But, they make it. This rough place still grants you food to eat. You grow potatoes, beets, rhubarb, cucumbers. You count the days until the September nights get so cold that your crops could freeze. But, you make it, sometimes just.So, you live in an environment where, you are grateful for the basics of survival. I think that this is important in understanding Russians. Any type of food that comes out of your native soil that will keep you alive in the winter. Enough logs to build a cabin. Enough firewood to keep from freezing. Russia is not a take things for granted place. You are very grateful for the basics. They are not just another consumer item that you pick up in the supermarket.How Much Is Enough?In Moscow I saw the material life of many Russians. This was in the early 2000 's, but it was basic. Much of the population still lived in Khrushchyovkas. These were a type of public housing, small, drab apartment blocks that were built in very large amounts during the Khrushchev era. The apartments are small and basic. But yet, I saw content looking people. They had their lives. There was always some shopping nearby and usually some parkland. There was frequent, cheap public transit on the boulevards outside.I presume things are changing to some extent now, but apparently Russia is still quite far from a situation where the average person can afford an elaborate condo, or certainly a villa with a two car garage. I think part of being a Russian, is accepting that, although your material life is rather limited, life can still be very good. I am not sure I understood, how much material longings many Russians had. Maybe family, or friendships, or a day in a park before the Moscow River, is what makes life really worth it.Where Do Russians Want To Go?It is a little trite to say a country is in transition. What country isn't?You could ask yourself, what would Russia would be like if the standard of living could be raised to that of a fully developed country, so Russia would sort of be a huge version of Finland?I believe that the beliefs that many Russians have stop this from happening. If you believe that, above all, Russia needs an all-powerful leader, how concerned are you going to be concerned about corruption and cronyism? If you feel you are content when you only have so much, how much of your feelings of security and national pride are you going to sacrifice, just to get more stuff?What sort of transition could you expect of the Russians? The country has a dark side of heavy alcoholism and domestic violence. But, the well-developed Scandinavian countries do too. It is cold. It is dark. Nature is dead. No matter what your feeling of gratitude is, and your contentment with what you have got, you can get depressed.There are certainly things about Russians that I couldn't figure out. Particularly, I don't understand the role of women and the attitude that women have towards themselves. When I think of Russian women, I think of my grandmother on a very cold Winnipeg day, long ago, in a heavy coat and in a babushka. I could not fathom whether modern Russian women saw themselves as all that basically different. Maybe some, in Moscow, but, in the country, maybe the babushka goes on.I felt that many Russians wanted to be part of a conservative culture that they identify as being very old, and dictated by Russia being a huge and very harsh land. I think they see it as national heritage that they pass from generation to generation. The people of that culture have gone through enormous pain not to have it wiped out by foreign invaders and destroyed by internal turmoil and repression.I suspect that some Russians would see, allowing their country to be just another glossy European place, as a dire self-betrayal. I don't think there is ever likely to be a real convergence between the Russians and the other European-origin nations.Martin LevineWhy is calling something ""1950s"" a stand in for saying socially conservative/racist/sexist? Weren't those negative aspects of the 1950s if anything more prevalent in eras before the 1950s? Why not say 1940s or 1930s?December 16, 2018Another Answer pointed out that there aren't many people around who can remember things before the 1950's, which is a good point.The Media Declare ConservatismI have a personal theory. The 1950's were an exceptional time of popular cultural output, supported by the new medium of television. Much of that output was powerful, some of it excellent, and it anchored the 1950's in the minds of people in the industrial democracies around the world.Also, the advent of TV meant a lot of people putting out political views in a mass forum, supported by visual images. The Cold War was in full swing. There was a major Communist scare and feelings in the United States that their society was being subverted, expressed loudly on TV. Because the 1950's were a prosperous time for at least the middle class of the United States and Canada, the media presentations were supported by substantial budgets raised by advertising, and, for the time, high production standards. Shows like “I Love Lucy”, “Leave It To Beaver” and “Father Knows Best” presented conservative images of society in a positive, convincing way. Films like “I Was a Communist for the FBI” and “ North by Northwest” presented the Red Scare in an entertaining way.The 1950's were almost a poignantly short period of time. It has sometimes been described as the “era of conservative consensus”, but it didn't last very long. It was a highly ideological time and probably the last decade, in the United States, or Canada, where most social institutions were viewed with confidence and some trust. However, if you didn't like the values of that era, the 1950's were a kind of prison. You didn't know that, if you just held on a few years, it would be all over. Society presented itself as eternal. The only permissible changes were technological, the 1950's family converted into the Jetsons. It seemed like the 1950's would go on forever, particularly for those who were being badly disadvantaged by them. Part of the enduring drama of the 1950's was, how, the values of the 1950's took only a few years to build up, and then, within a few years dissipated, at least in part..These were not 1930's and 1940's values. There wasn't much scope in those two decades for ideas and ideologies based on expanding, successful suburban life for Caucasians, the very rapid introduction of new gadgets, that were available to the mass consumer, the rise in power of the advertising agencies, the “man in the gray flannel suit” and TV evangelists. The 1950's was the advent of the time when there were two superpowers dominating the world, able to destroy it with nuclear weapons, in just a few minutes. There hadn't previously been the military-industrial complex and mutually assured destruction. There hadn't previously been talk show hosts, or rock and roll transferring bits of Afro-American culture into the American Caucasian world. It was also a time of ex-servicemen, turning en masse into family fathers, ruling like low level military officers over their household. The conservatives of the time were dealing with a new situation and produced new types of responses.Erasure And Denial As Social TacticsA favoured approach to social problems in the 1950's was to deny their existence, pretend the people involved didn't really exist, at least as members of a social unit, and to demonize individuals who offended the prevalent social norms. So, Negro “agitators” were bad people, because most Blacks were happy as they were. Homosexuals were individual, dangerous perverts, not members of a community. You couldn't be a socialist without being a Communist. All women had a mothering instinct, except lazy, morally slack ones. Teenager girls who got pregnant were simply “bad”.When you see a modern person now, expressing hostility to transgendered people, or to libertards, or demonizing Nancy Pelosi or Hillary Clinton, it snaps you back to that golden age of condemning, say around 1956.The People Who Never Left The 1950'sWhen I say the 1950's quickly disintegrated, very soon into the 1960's, the era disappeared, but not some of the people in it. It is a phenomenon in American society, There is a substantial block of people who see no value in much if any of the social and legal changes that have happened since then. In their minds, the values and social arrangements of the 1950's were correct then, and still are are now. They remind you of the 1950's because they still uphold the beliefs of the 1950's. There is really nothing you can say to them. To them, someone who disagrees is simply a bad immoral person, not someone who you discuss things with. This part of the population has existed continuously since the 1950's. They weren't so much noticed because, after the 1950's, it was the reformers and the rise of social groups that had been oppressed during the 1950's that got most of the attention. There was a hope that persons who expressed 1950's-ish ideas were a vestige. But, they are not. They aren't relics. They are representatives on an ongoing belief system with a substantial population of followers.I think people who wanted to believe 1950's thinking was gone, sometimes feel a sense of shock and outrage when they encounter people who express the values of what is to them a despised era. How dare they! How can they still be here after all the progressive work that has been done? It is almost a mirror image of the 1950's conceptualization of people who are different. That is, this time, these people are bad and wrong.Misunderstanding The 1950'sLife went on. It wasn't all the McCarthy hearings. It wasn't all the Arkansas National Guard blocking Black children from entering a school.Nuance isn't necessarily very emotionally satisfying. It is convenient to use the 1950's to symbolize social evil and so chastize anyone who says anything that sounds like a relic from that time, without reservation. It is probably easier if you do not have any personal memory of the 1950's.The 1950's was not simply a dreadful decade where lots of people were evil. Life went on. And, frankly, while I would not in any way condone the racism, anti-semitism, anti-intellectualism and homophobia of that time, some things were functioning reasonably well. A lot of reasonably-priced housing got built. The economy of the USA and Canada expanded. New schools and hospitals were being built and the universities expanded. It was the high time of Broadway and musical films. It was the time of jazz.It was also the time of new appliances and women living in well-equipped homes and, in large numbers, driving cars. It was the time of unionized labour. I am not sure the women's movement of the 1970's could have happened without the 1950's liberation of many women from exhausting chores and the release of many women from rural poverty.The 1950's was also the last time before the great drug epidemic that began not that long after and the rise of urban crime and extremely dangerous ghettos. A few years later some American urban centres were in a time of rioting and crisis.So, tagging any socially conservative, racist or sexist person as a representative of the 1950's is a distortion of what the 1950's were. It is possible for someone to be somewhat nostalgic about the 1950's and to produce some positive facts about the decade, without them being considered homophobic prudes and bigots. They could demand a rendering up of facts, an explanation of just why daily life now, is so much better, at least for a large part of the population, then it was then. They could point to a lengthy list of things that have gone wrong.It is interesting that old-time, 1950's, elite patrician Republicans are now being compared against the modern issue, and are being remembered with a little bit of fondness.Too Much Pendulum Swinging Leads To A Distorted Remembrance of HistoryPeople who have been abused are likely to stay angry for a long time. The 1950's definitely were a time when some types of people were badly abused.I sometimes fantacize. What if I could go back to the 1950's as I am now, all grown up, and demand some retribution? What if I could walk up to the crappy, abusive school teacher, the bullies, everybody who would say to young boys, “If you aren't butch you are just a girl.”, and scream my head off and unleash a tirade of obscenities. What if I could abuse and demean them, the abusers? What if I could say, “You are ugly person. You have no dress sense. And the reason you can be an hysterical prude is that you are utterly ugly, and nobody is going to do anything with you in any case.” It would be awfully tempting.While the large majority of people today do not remember the 1950's, there are some more who remember the immediate after period in the 1960's, when there was a strong effort to confront 1950's ways and those people who didn't change their attitude on December 31, 1959. Even if you don't remember that either, you may have been told what it was like.So, it is modern times. You meet someone who is expressing what seems to be 1950's attitudes, but now you aren't helpless. You can lash right back, and lash them not just in person, but all over the Web. I admit it myself, dumping on someone who represents evil, particularly evil done to you and people like you, is an excellent catharsis. If you believe they are valueless people, why not do it, as much as you want?What If The 1950's Come Back?At the moment, there is a major loss of confidence about whether the reforms that brought an end to the worst abuses of the 1950's, will endure. Until the current American administration, they were widely seen as unassailable and permanent. Now the people who benefited are scared. So, someone who expresses what seem to be 1950's attitudes is not just a silly anachronism, but a dire threat. Their evocation of the 1950's causes near panic and fury.As a baby boom child, I admit to be being bothered by a doubt that won't go away. What if the 1950's were right, or at least could have been right for me? I could have bought a nice house back then, even in Toronto or Vancouver. Since women needed to submit to men to earn a decent living, chances are you could get one who would. There wasn't affirmative action back then to destroy the career prospects of middle class white men. There were lots of two parent families, able to by stuff without two income and sinking into debt. A driving holiday to Miami Beach wouldn't break the bank. There wasn't meths. Heroine was the only very harsh drug, and using it was restricted to a small part of the population. Generally, being a drug dealer meant, going to jail for a very long time.The 1950's is the non-forgotten decade. Its issues still speak powerfully to our own. 1950's values have not disappeared. When you resist them in your own mind, you have to find ways to minimize the impact of some very bad things that have happened since. For some of us, battling the 1950's and making the effort not to excuse anything about the socially conservative, racist and sexist attitudes of the time, means we have an ongoing battle within our own head.Martin LevineHow are Canada’s and the US government similar?December 13, 2018Sometimes the devil is in the details. The two countries have broadly similar governmental systems. However, there are numerous differences, some at the constitutional level, and others that are more practical.At The Constitutional Level, What Is Or Isn't Similar?Both countries are federal democracies. In both cases the fundamental law is a constitution. Both have a national legislature, in the national capital. Both have a national bureaucracy, headquartered in the capital. Both countries employ career civil servants, placed in a particular position in a combination of the merit principal and affirmative action.Both countries have sub-national divisions and legislatures, provinces and states, with state and provincial capitals, where their legislatures are located.After that, at the fundamental level, it is mostly different. Canada does not have a constitutional structure that recognizes a “balance of powers”. Parliament is meant to be supreme. In Canada the executive and the legislature are partially fused. There is no separate election for the Prime Minister. The Prime Minister is an elected member of the legislature, with their own parliamentary constituency. There has been concern for some years that the Supreme Court of Canada is trying to assume a legislative role similar to the United States Supreme Court.Both the American and Canadian national legislatures are bicameral. All the Canadian provincial legislatures are unicameral.Unlike the United States legislature, Canada's is only modestly bicameral. The Canadian Senate is an appointive body, patterned to some extent after the British House of Lords. It was meant to be a chamber of “sober second thought”, not a veto power. However, in part because of some very poor quality Senator appointments, the Senate has lost much of its credibility. To a certain extent, it has become the vermiform appendix of Canadian politics. However, because of Supreme Court of Canada ruling several years ago, the Senate is virtually impossible to abolish.At the highest level, there is a very basic difference. Canada is a constitutional monarchy. The head of state is the same monarch as the British one, but she is directly Queen (Or King) of Canada, irrespective of being the monarch of the United Kingdom. So the head of state and the head of the executive are not the same people.Her Majesty the Queen is represented in Canada by the Governor General. The Queen reigns, but does not rule. Her role, and that of the Governor General, is largely ceremonial. However, in some ways, the Queen still has a very important role. For example, when either a federal or a provincial government issues a contract, they issue it on behalf of Her Majesty the Queen. So, a federal contract is issued in the name of Her Majesty the Queen in Right of Canada. A provincial government contract issued by Her Majesty the Queen, in Right (for example) of Manitoba, or whatever province it is.Both countries have federal territories in addition to province or states. However, Canada has three geographically very large federal territories in the sparsely-populated north, that contain a large part of Canada's total geographic area.Both countries recognize some special status for indigenous peoples. However, in Canada, the concept of relationships between the indigenous communities has come to be that of nation to nation. So, indigenous governments are another order of government. Indigenous communities have at least partial control over large areas of land. The federal Nunavut Territory, which is enormous, is a cultural and political home for the Inuit people.At the federal level, Canada has no provision for recall elections. British Columbia has such provisions but they are not being used. There is no Canadian equivalent to impeachment. Since the Prime Minister is the head of their party in the House of Commons, in the event of egregious behaviour, his parliamentary caucus could vote to remove him.In fact, the entire federal government, or a provincial government, could change as a result of what is called, in the British system, a “confidence vote”. If the governing party presents a money bill that fails to win the support of the legislature, generally their term of office is finished. For the most part, there will be a new election of the legislature, no matter whether the normal term of office is near completion.Provinces Versus StatesBroadly they have similar powers and behave in similar ways. However, there is a substantial difference in the distribution of powers, if you compare the constitutions of the two countries. In particular, provinces do not have the constitutional authority to pass criminal legislation or charter banks. There is one federal Criminal Code only. And, a banking charter can only be issued by the federal government, which has chosen to create a banking system dominated by five, nation wide, bricks and mortars banks. These major banks are permitted to engage in stock brokering.But, the provinces in some ways are more empowered than the states. They guard their constitutional sovereignty very jealously. The Canadian federal government does not have an equivalent of the United States Department of the Interior or the Bureau of Land Management. Parks Canada is responsible for Canada's national parks. However, in Canada, lands in a province, that are not privately owned, are frequently owned by the provincial governments or more precisely, they control them on behalf of Her Majesty the Queen, in Right of the province concerned. Even at the more practical level, the Canadian government cannot impose something like the Interstate Highway system. If the federal governments wants to offer road improvement money to a province, in the interests of improving the national economy, a province can accept it if they wish. However, road transport is a provincial matter only.In both Canada and the USA there are areas of concurrent constitutional authority, in addition to powers that are exclusively those of the state or provincial, and the federal governments. However, in Canada there is no equivalent of the United States Department of Education nor the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development. Education and housing, and municipal matters, are under the exclusive authority of the provincial governments.There is another very large difference. As many Americans know, Canada has a socialized system of medical insurance. However, each province has its own system. Private, for profit hospitals are not economically viable, because, when providing care to citizens and permanent residents of Canada, they could only charge according to the provincial government fee schedule. They cannot over bill the patient. The provincial governments are responsible for operating the comprehensive medical and hospital systems. The federal government tries to enable roughly equal standards across Canada by providing some support. There is a federal Department of Health, and a Department of Public Health, but they do not operate the system.Military and PolicingBoth federal governments are responsible for the operation of their militaries. However, there is no Canadian equivalent to the National Guard or the state militias. The Canadian Department of National Defence operates a Reserve Force.Both countries have national police forces, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police and the Federal Bureau of Investigation. The RCMP performs some of the national crime prevention and detection functions of the FBI. However, it is different. Most of the smaller Canadian provinces do not maintain the equivalent of State Police forces. Only Quebec, Ontario and Newfoundland and Labrador have the equivalents. Other provinces hire the services of the RCMP to do local policing in rural municipalities and small urban centres, on a contract basis. Quite unlike the FBI, the RCMP does highway patrol, issues tickets and intervenes in family disputes.Canada does not have elective sheriffs or judge. They are civil servants here.Canada's Municipalities, A Little DisempoweredBoth countries use municipal governments to provide local services and do land use and business regulation.Canadian municipalities have mayors the way American ones do, and provide similar services. As in the USA, the mayor is frequently elected directly. Only some Canadian municipalities have parliamentary systems, with governing and opposition parties. However, the mayor is frequently a sitting member of City Council, with one vote, just like the rest of the councillors.Canadian municipalities are, constitutionally, the “creatures of the provinces”. The provincial governments control them tightly. Frequently, the municipalities are not allowed to incur their own debt. So, municipal bond issues are rare. Also, Canadian municipalities are not permitted to impose local retail taxes or licence tag fees. The municipalities mostly raise funds through property tax levies, service fees and parking tickets, and approach the provincial governments for grants.Britain Brings Us TogetherThe concepts of habeus corpus, freehold property originate for both Canada and the USA from Britain. Britain went through a very long historic process to impose the supremacy of an elected legislature over the head of state, If you feel free, with civil rights, in either Canada or the US, it is appropriate to turn towards London, and feel some admiration and thanks.So, Is It That Different?An American wouldn't find a provincial office that issues driver and vehicle licences from their state Department of Provincial Vehicles. When you get a speeding ticket and demerits, it feels just as bad whether you local elected sheriff gives it to you or an officer of the RCMP. And, when you drive across a provincial boundary, and know you are back in your own province, it feels the same as if you are an American, driving across that last state line that gets you back home.And, if your local Mayor is spouting nonsense, a Canadian mayor is just as irritating as an American one.So, on a day to day basis the governmental system doesn't seem that different. However, if you are a Canadian, you don't wake up saying, “Where has my State Militia gone”? or “Why can't I petition to have the Prime Minister recalled?”But, if you look at a lot of the details, the similarities can start to look a little superficial. It isn't that one system is better or worse. It is that Canada and the USA are two different countries, with no particular reason to be all that similar.Martin LevineWhat aspect of American culture/life is most incompatible with other nations?December 12, 2018I should start by saying that this Answer will not be a tirade against the USA. Like any other country, Americans have the right to be what they want to be. Also, the USA is far from being the only country that can produce an incompatibility response from people in others. Canada can certainly make foreigners nervous.However, what does incompatible mean in the context of this question? I don't think it means just different, or exotic. It would have to be something that causes a non-American to feel some concern or discomfort. So, they simply can't accept what some Americans do. Or, they feel they can't deal or work with Americans because of some characteristic.I say Americans, not the USA, for a good reason. A culture doesn't mean anything unless somebody in particular is doing something about it. The USA is a nation state. It doesn't have a culture independently of what Americans think and do.Of course, Americans don't all think or do the same thing. A feeling of incompatibility can be the result of an information gap. The American popular media are what non-Americans see, unless they visit the USA or have Americans visit them. On the other hand, unless you visit the USA, you won't notice some of the things that are unbearable.I don't think you can have one bucket list of American cultural behaviours that offend everybody that isn't American. It depends what culture the offendee themselves come from. Somebody from a European Union country might find different appalling things from someone from South Asia.Some of what various non-Americans may find incompatible is, how, because of some parts of American culture, people in a country that is, in principal, wealthy, use whatever wealth they have in a particular way. The American model is probably unique,The United States Constitution And Me, The AmericanI have commented in other Answers, Americans have a personal relationship with their Constitution that does not exist in other countries. Life is based on an individual, interacting with and exercising their constitutional rights. Unless you can clearly understand that, and not make a judgement about something that is part of the fundamental law of the country, this is highly likely to give you issues with a lot of Americans. Non-Americans can misunderstand the emphasis on the “Me” as selfishness. It can create an impression of Americans as people who you cannot negotiate with. Some other countries are much farther towards the “We” end of the cultural spectrum. I am not just talking about cultures in the Far East or the developing world. Other countries among the developed, industrial countries are a lot more We oriented. So personality traits like the willingness to identify with a group, the willingness to compromise, the willingness to accept government-driven social measures, is a lot greater. I stress, it is a complete misunderstanding of Americans, but, if you don't understand the relationship between an individual American and their constitution, they can look primitive.False Veneration Of The Working Class“The Dukes of Hazzard” was a popular programme in Canada, but you wouldn't get away with anything like that here. Feminists will not tolerate Daisy Dukes. Roseanne wasn't quite as popular. Basically, in Canada, an actual Roseanne would be seen as a disadvantaged, working class woman, who ought to be re-educated, given social programme support, and warned to keep her speech politically correct.The context isn't very apparent to a lot of non-Americans. They don't understand how a huge, commercial television market will try to win a lot of viewers, by complimenting large-sized groups in the population. Unless you are rather familiar with the USA, you don't necessarily understand how skewed an income distribution can be in an industrial democracy with such a high level of GNP, and how so many people can be in a disadvantaged working class.However, non-Americans are not required to have knowledge and empathy any more than Americans have to. Parts of the American working class have cultures and lifestyles that are not compatible with anywhere outside of the USA. If they acted out to foreigners, they would face a lot of hostility.The SouthIt is far from being the case that all Caucasians in the Old Confederacy meet the negative stereotypes. However, some do. Having the USA as a buffer around them spares them from receiving the foreign reaction they would otherwise get. Certainly there are racists in other countries, but there is no comparison to the southern system of racism, combined with nostalgia, religious fervour, cultural aggression and sometimes, a plea for patience and sympathy. For the most part, much of what they would receive from a lot of non-Americans, should they have to interact with them, is hostility. There is a perception in some other countries that the South is a powerful and pivotal part of the USA. It makes the entire USA seem incompatible.Bring Your Guns To TownA gun-totting American is one who is unlikely to get any foreign love. An American sees the right to bear arms. A lot of non-Americans see chaos and a disregard for human life. NRA members are not the sort of people a lot of non-Americans would tolerate. The American gun culture, and the people in it, are incompatible with anywhere else.Mean American Internationalists Who Haven't Done Their ResearchI said it in a previous Answer, a true American isolationist can justify saying that they have little or no interest in foreign countries. What they want the United States Government to do is to disengage. No free trade agreements. The minimum possible participation in military alliances. As little internationalism as possible. If you believe in that, what, about the lands beyond the borders of the United States, do you really need to know?However, the current United States Administration has drawn foreign attention to a distinctly incompatible type of American, those who want international engagements, but are not infrequently angry at some of the other countries concerned, and sees no need to know about them. They have always been there but currently there are quite a few speaking loud.They are participating in a subculture that is determinedly incompatible with the rest of the world. No foreigner is going to honour that sort of behaviour. When this type of American, or groups of Americans in the subculture they represent, act out to foreigners, all they are going to get is hostility and contempt back.If one could talk about an overlapping cultural subset, it is Americans who declare American exceptionalism and the house on the hill concept. To a lot of non-Americans, it is a face slap by ignorant people. All a foreigner is likely to tell them is, “You are talking nonsense. You are wrong. And, there is nothing to talk about with you.”Self-Promotion In A Constitutional WorldWhat do you do in a country where the Constitution tells you, it is you, on your own? The culture you live in is also telling you, what matters about you is your economic success. And, it is a geographically very big country, with a lot of money rolling around, if you can figure out how to make it, and where to go.The result is a American personality that is very hard to understand. It isn't just traditional cultures that place their primary emphasis on the family. In a country with a good social safety net, you can usually find a reason to stay near home. And, it is good to consider the interests of the group, maybe before your own.It isn't necessarily the case that the roaming, money-seeking American, promoting themselves however and whenever they can, is really obnoxious to all that many foreigners. The foreigners just don't get it. What sort of relationship can you have with people who are so self-focused?I talk about the economic side, but there is another aligned American cultural feature, the individual's search for fun and entertainment. It isn't that non-Americans don't look for them. However, the way some Americans do it is disconcerting. How can people justify entertaining themselves with conspiracy theories about Chemtrails and lizard bases underneath Area 51? When does doing open carry to Walmart, become a kind of personal theatrical presentation? Sometimes the newscasts seem like commercials, and entertainment celebrities appear to be the most admired people in the country. How can you understand this type of American culture? What can you possibly say to an American in it? Should you reassure them that there isn't one scaly lizard alien in your whole country, and if there were, you promise not to let any of them near Las Vegas?The American As A High Plains DrifterI think it takes a visit to the USA to understand that there are a whole lot of Americans who are nice, average, not dogmatic and not hostile. It is easier for Canadian border shoppers, who might do a weekend in Seattle , Grand Forks, North Dakota, or Buffalo. You have to face it then, so many Americans are utterly normal and reasonable.However, if you haven't had the personal experience of dealing with the pleasant sales staff at J.C. Penney, or sitting next to likeable American families at a buffet all you can eater, what you tend to know, or think you know about the US, is the strange subcultures. You could sum it up, the hair-trigger, drifter, American, a religious fanatic who might think you are a scaly lizard too, and is ready to open fire.Or, you stumble into a bikini dance contest, and as much as you are having an excellent time, you imagine that this is what being an American as all about.Should Americans Do Anything About It?What should an alien say? In principal, it would be nice if all Americans were kind of cuddly, but it would make the USA a boring place to fantacize about, or, frankly, yes, sometimes. to feel a little jealous of.I think Americans who want to persuade us foreigners that they are compatible really do need to work at it. But, unless it really bothers them, is there any real need? It is the incompatible Americans that make America, America. And, they really do need to be incompatible, because it is their way of life, and the United States Constitution has something to do with it.As a personal opinion, let us foreigners be incompatible back, and it is all good.Martin LevineCan cultures become ""mentally ill""?November 27, 2018Only people can become mentally ill. A culture is not a corporeal being, so it can't. However I think I know what this answer is getting at. Cultures that are collectively empowered, make what appear to be collective decisions. Sometimes the decisions seem crazy.Of course, there is no firm definition of what a “culture” is. As I have said various times, Canada has two official, language based cultures. There isn't one culture in Canada, crazy or sane. But, even in a place with a very strong national identity, like the USA, is there one “culture”. I think there are sort of parts of it, and then there is the popular culture so effectively promoted by America's very effective mass media. However, is that enough to give any American a full cultural package? Probably not, if you are talking about basic values, what facts are seen as more important then others, what is seen as “fake” or “alternative” news, what people enjoy and fear, what people's jealousies are, etc.What may seem like a whole culture being mentally ill, may even be reflect that a given population is culturally split. Different groups in the population are struggling and very angry at each other. Anger feeds irrationality.Without sounding like an episode of the original Star Trek series, there is always going to be a dichotomy between logic, and looking for an emotional high. In a whole lot of cases, emotions will clean logic's clock. The human brain is built on layers of non-rational neural material, our basic drives for food, water, sex, our fear of predators, etc. Most biologists seem to feel that sentience evolved in the last two million years or so. If we didn't have our primitive drives, what would be left of us?Extreme And Not Extreme ExamplesI suppose we might call Nazi Germany an example of a culture gone insane, but there are others, Cambodia, China's cultural revolution, etc.However, there isn't any evidence that most of Germany's population had already gone mad. Pre-Nazi Germany had hard traditions, and had committed some notable atrocities in the First World War, but they weren't on the level of what the Nazis did.When you talk about “mental illness”, how much can you expect of people? We would like people to be kind and empathetic, to view strangers without fear, but who says that this is “normal”?In a certain way we had this debate in Canada, from the 1950's onward. Up until the 1950's, most morality in Canada was provided by means of religion. The power of the churches waned very rapidly during the late 1950's and 1960's, both in English-speaking and French Canada. As I have said in other Answers, the elites of Canada set out to create a sort of secular values and norms replacement for the declining religions, and also for their own benefit. We know the results for English-speaking Canada. It is the rather politically correct, multicultural, social safety net and human rights-oriented, feminist, English-speaking Canada, that we have today. Quebec is a bit of a counter case. The elite there hasn't rushed to endorse multiculturalism. There is not a set of strong influencers who are admonishing Quebecers who have a more traditional sense of their own identity.Being Mean Isn't The Same As Being CrazyI wonder what would have happened to Canada if there hadn't been that confident elite, re-educating English-speaking Canadians into a sort of secular religion. As a bi-Jew, I am glad I never found out.Non-Canadians, or for that matter, the many Canadians who haven't paid much attention to the country's history, may have a little bit of difficulty following this alternative scenario, but, it is scary for vulnerable Canadians to think about.The Liberal Party of Canada doesn't come into power in the 1960's. Other than the sometimes rather far right-wing Social Credit, there is no national party uniting anglophones and francophones. Instead there is a Progressive Conservative national government that will not relinquish some of the more symbolic ties with Britain and refuses national bilingualism and biculturalism.Quebec's Quiet Revolution goes on anyhow, and by 1965, most of the Quebecois have had enough, and Quebec separates. We are left with a sort of rump, English-speaking Canada, that has to attempt to function as a nation. The Liberal Party of Canada has been discredited by its support of Quebec's aspirations. Instead we have a Canada strongly flavoured by British supremacists, rural conservatives, the big business community, and the decidedly intolerant contribution of Alberta and British Columbia Social Credit. Presuming this whole structure doesn't collapse and get absorbed by the USA (Where it would be what some of us would see as a bad influence.), what sorts of personalities would we have in Canada. How many racist, misogynist, authoritarian, gay hating Canadians would there be?They wouldn't be mentally ill, they would be English-speaking Canadians in another timeline. The science fiction possibilities would be fascinating, an alternative, evil, Canadian universe, that even the United Federation of Planets would have difficulty with. No more Mr. Nice Canadian, and Mrs. Canadian never becomes Ms. Canadian. Instead she is either a “rug-ranked” secretary, as we used to say (The secretary was the property of the manager she worked for and derived her status from this sort of additional husband.) and, generally, a woman's place is in the home, which is a man's castle.This wouldn't be an insane Canadian culture. It could have happened. Mean and nasty would have been the behavioural normal.When Does A Culture Really Step Over The Line?So, you have a culture where people are generally mean, racist, greedy, judgmental, feel superior and see others as inferiors. (The classic Untermenschen.) That is not mental illness. When that culture is situated in an economy that is in poor shape, even less so. People will struggle for anything that makes them feel better about themselves, and will look for hope.Psychopaths Can RuleWho were the really crazy people in a place like Nazi Germany? Probably not most of the population.Personality disorders get various descriptions, including in medical dictionaries. However, personality disorders tend to describe situations where the individual themselves is suffering, because their disorder hampers their own functioning in society. However, what happens if you are a monster, but you are doing just fine, or your viciousness is even helping you be a success?Hitler's SS and Gestapo was full of monstrous people. Many of them were murderous, extremely racist sadists. However, even if they were paranoid, they did well for a good long time. Their values only became dysfunctional for them, when Nazi behaviour triggered other powerful countries to fight back.They weren't dumb either. They knew how to control information. They knew how to terrorize even the people they didn't want to kill. They were also notably good organizers and kept complete records.They fed the German population fake news. But the average German didn't get to see most of the most vile and appalling real results. Doubtless a lot of Germans disliked Jews and homosexuals. They probably didn't mind the Nazis “dealing” with them, but most of them didn't learn just how. It all probably seemed like a good idea at the time. If you didn't believe the Nazi line that things had to be strict, because Germany was under urgent threat from the Bolsheviks, the British Empire, and a Jewish-dominated America, you would have been well advised to keep quiet about it.Nazi Germany wasn't an insane culture, because people are not naturally “good”. Normal people can be manipulated. The manipulators were what a lot of people would one might call evil, but not crazy. (And, nowadays, there are still substantial populations of people who believe in ethnic cleansing, and think they will benefit from it.)The Facts Are There And You Deny ThemWe see people doing that in countries where there is freedom of information. The facts are out there, and verifiable and people ignore and deny them. When a whole lot of people do that, is that a mentally ill sub-culture?The denial isn't because those people have cognitive difficulties. And, who says people have to accept facts? It would be a sign of a dire personality disorder if you deny facts that strongly bear on your existence (So do smokers have a personality disorder?) However, what happens when your denial doesn't imperil your own existence? Say you are an Alt-Righter. There is no law that requires you to be considerate or helpful to others. There is nothing that says you says that you have to be tolerant. You would only step over the line if you acted out your attitude in a way that got you prosecuted. If your denial of reality made you believe that you are under attack (By Jews, by feminists, by immigrants, by non-whites or whoever.) maybe then, you and the other people in your subculture are acting on the basis of a type of mental illness.)Otherwise, you deny facts that make you feel bad, disempowered and hopeless. You don't believe that all people are created equal. You don't even believe that some people should have the right to vote. Your beliefs don't make you suffer, so are you mentally ill?I should explain that I my views are not just some mental aggression against right wingers that I don't like. We see supposed progressives, in Canada, the USA and elsewhere, engaging in what might be called paranoid ideation and self-damaging reality denial, in a society where the facts are available, if you wanted to look at them.No ExcusesI agree that there a substantial numbers of people in any given society who suffer from mental illness, even if you define it rather tightly. As a Canadian, I am glad that psychiatric care is available here, without a bill, although the waiting time to see a psychiatrist can be far too long.However, an entire culture, or even a subculture, being “mentally ill”, is seldom an explanation for vile behaviour. As a person with a religious background, I find it hard not to believe that some people are simply evil. There are probably many more people than I would like to admit, who couldn't care less about others, or anybody outside of their self-identifying group, and don't have the tolerant values I would like them to have. They benefit from that attitude so they are not mentally ill.When religion drains out, and, unlike in Canada, there isn't an elite group in a position to make up a moral “new normal”, this is what you get. People who would like to defend themselves from the nasty folks can only band together and defend their own interests. Since most of the nasty people are not mentally ill, nor are the cultures they create, you cannot cure them.Martin LevineIf you went back in time to 1950 knowing what you know now, would you realistically have a better life than those living in 1950?November 26, 2018For me, this is rather an emotive question. I didn't come into the world until 1951, but sometimes I feel like, I turned my head away for just a second, and the 1950's were gone. Is this sort of a lesson about life, that you learn when it is too late? Absolutely nothing is permanent for a human being.The 1950's being gone, symbolizes to me the adults who I knew then, who are gone now, who showed so much kindness and care. If I could meet them again, what could I say? Of course, it would depend on who I was. If I came back as a small child, but in a reverse reincarnation, knowing about the life I have lived since then, what could I do? You couldn't function as a child. Your parents wouldn't know what to do with you. Psychiatry had started in Winnipeg. Would they have sent you there? What could the psychiatrist do? How could he get the situation published in a medical journal?This question reminds me very strongly of an episode from the original Twilight Zone series. Martin (Yes, Martin.), a character played by Gig Young, is a young, aggressive businessman, as I recall, from New York City. On a rare day off, he goes for a country drive, and stops for an oil change, at a garage very near the town where he grew up. Martin decides to take a walk over to the town, right through a time warp, and ends up in the 1920's. He encounters his parents. After various missteps, trying to interfere with his own childhood, he sits down with his Dad and they talk. Martin finally opens up and tells his father how his life is a stress-ridden, miserable rush. (The father had asked, “Is it really so bad where you come from Martin?) His Dad tells him that he must let his child self live his own life, while grown-up Martin lives his. He tells Martin that sometimes, he ought to stop and smell the flowers. They say goodbye. Martin walks back to through the time warp, to his oil change. However, he has changed. He had been rude and abrupt to the garage mechanic before. He apologizes and gives the mechanic a generous tip. In the final few seconds of the episode, Martin is sitting in his car, lights up a cigarette and is thinking about what he has seen that day. He isn't the same Martin anymore.Given my religious background, I can not help but think of this episode in divine intervention terms. So, a compassionate deity intervened in Martin's life. I wish there had been a sequel, where Martin goes back to Manhattan. Would he marry a nice girl, attend synagogue on a regular basis, keep Kosher and buy a single family bungalow in Levittown?As A Kid You Couldn't Do AnythingYou sure couldn't do it in Winnipeg in the 1950's. Say, for the sake of argument, you knew better than to tell Mom, Dad or anyone else that you had returned from the future, what could you have possibly done?The 1950's was a special time, although maybe not unique. For a few years, there was an absolute assertion that things would stay the same forever, except for science fiction stuff like rocket ships. The future (Unless it was a nightmare triumph of Communism. There were films warning you about that. I recall one Twilight Zone episode that dealt with a future totalitarian nightmare state, but Rod Serling was kind of liberal, and I think he really wanted to talk about Nazi Germany.) The only acceptable future scenario was Jetsonesque, the 1950's nuclear family in a bungalow in the sky.A double bind was, my Jewish Winnipeg of the time. Winnipeg was a conservative, provincial city and the Jewish Community was strongly what now would be called, “social conservative”. Also, World War II had ended only a few years only, and people were traumatized and down in a crouch. There were definite limits on what an adult member of the community could say to anybody, and the views of children were not considered worthwhile. The working assumption was a Jewish take on Jetsonesque, maybe a synagogue in the sky and a good girl Jewish does not put out until marriage, and not very much after. Instead, a bar mitvah buffet forever.Say, you came back to the 1950's when you already twenty-five. Even then, what could you have said to anybody? Could you talk about feminism, gay rights, the advent of a multiracial immigration policy for Canada? You would have brusquely told to shut up, or else get kicked out of B'nai Brith!Canada, Not The Same RevolutionFor American readers, I should explain that, if you treat the 1950's as an episode that produced an outcome, it wasn't the same outcome in Canada. The 1950's USA faded off very rapidly in the early 1960's. The Cuban Missile Crisis, the Kennedy Assassination, Vietnam and the urban racial riots ended part of the era in just a few years. I say, “part of”, because a sizable part of the American population didn't want it to end and still doesn't. Looking at it from the outside, much of the current American division is between the demonizers of the 1950's and those who wish passionately that it would return. For the most part, you still can't talk and give advice about it. It leads to screaming.Canada exited the 1950's in a different way. In a sense, it francophonized, ethnicized and urbanized itself out of the era. The Canada of the 1950's had rural, religious based values. The cities grew quickly during a prosperous era of industrialization, The decline of Britain, and the rise of the “French Fact”, severed most of the British Imperial thinking. The work force that was a per-requisite of the urban industrial growth had to be sourced from Mainland Europe. By the latter part of the 1960, non-white immigration, in substantial volumes, was permitted.I have said before, Canadian life is elite driven. The elites nowadays are somewhat, although not completely different, but the changes I described above were largely regulated by the elite. In just a few years, the welfare, religion free, feminist, politically correct state, that enrages some Americans, was in place.Say, I had survived the 1950's, growing up again, and knew enough to keep my mouth shut until an opportune time, there wasn't one thing I could have said to have any effect on the situation. Various individuals did speak up. They were viewed as marginal and unimportant. Contrary arguments, if you wanted to make one, were dismissed. The groups that made them were dismissed almost as much. Generally, the Albertans are identified as the greatest remaining reservoir of pre-modern Canada, but, even there, someone arguing that a woman's place is in the home, or arguing for white supremacy, would be reviled, or under certain circumstances, prosecuted.Individual SolutionsIf we rule out making hopeless arguments for changes in society, what individual improvements could you make in your 1950's life?I was born in 1951. Say, it is 1958. Would seven-year old me be arguing with my Dad about his patriarchal attitude? Would I have suggested that my older sister try free love?If I was my age when I was that age, the best that I could do would be to look forward to an escape point. Or alternatively, could I change my attitude?I hated playing sports. Hockey Night in Canada, on black and white TV, was OK, except, if it ran too long, it extinguished the weekly episode of the original Twilight Zone. Actually, that is still how I see my 1950's. The knowledge that you are trapped in a situation where most people don't think the way you do, they call the shots, they get what they want, and you don't.And, that is a constant that never did fully change. There is more space for counter cultures than there was in the 1950's, but hockey and beer commercial Canada carries on, still taking up a large part of Canadian culture. Canada hasn't had the culture wars of the USA. There is something more indirect here. The non-elites are permitted some old fashion pleasures, particularly if it supports the economy. I could scream outrage about it in the year 2018. It is still a type of popular culture bullying, with a generous shot of toxic masculinity, mixed up with an excuse for incipient alcoholism. Who would listen?So, if you are that returned to 1956, five year old, presuming your brain has matured enough to handle the information you know about the future, what economic benefits could you derive? If you had paid attention, perhaps you would know of stocks that were going to rise over the course of time. However, had I had that information, I don't think I could have talked my Dad into taking investment advice from a five-year old. If you came back to 1950 as a twenty-five year old, maybe you would work like hell and scrape together every thing you could into the stock market. (For example, buy something like Bank of Montreal stocks.)I would have been motivated by knowing that adult me would inevitably have some gender issues. I would have had as a goal, to make a desperate break for freedom, to wherever the first gay village was to open up in Canada. However, say for the sake of argument, I became sexually active when I was eighteen, in 1969. Up until the 1980's, I would have had to insist to prospective partners, that use of a condom was absolutely necessary. Think of trying to do this during the 1970's.I suppose I could have made different educational choices. However, would my future have been better by being an accountant or orthodontist in Winnipeg? A real issue is, you would know what your first adult life was like, but you would have no certainty about what would have happened in your alternative reality. It could even have been worse! As a very wise American said, “Que será, será. Whatever will be, will be. The future's not ours to see. Que será, será. What will be, will be.”(I am quoting the lyrics from Google.)Maybe Martin's Dad had a point. Had I known what I know, maybe the most useful thing I could have done was to spend more time smelling the roses. Maybe I would have spent more time with those care-giving people I now so much miss. I would have spent more time listening to them, asking them for advice and thanking them. Maybe instead of sitting there on Saturday night, eating what we now call junk food, while watching Hockey Night in Canada, I should have found some way to get more exercise, without it being “sports”. I am not sure how the Winnipeg of 1958 would have taken a seven year old Jewish boy jogging. (Would my parents have let me? My mother was rather traditional about the then Jewish attitude about food, and would have got very stressed that I wasn't eating enough.) They had roses in Winnipeg and, if you didn't make it too obvious, you literally could have spent a few minutes smelling them. Also, I could have sent Rod Serling a fan letter.Ephemeralcy and You Can't Change ItIf I had known in the 1950's what I know now, I couldn't have changed much of anything for anyone else or myself. If I was the twenty-five year old investor, maybe by about the late 1970's I would have been in pretty good financial shape.You couldn't talk about much in the 1950's. People were far too confident that the era would go on, forever. Asserting that it wouldn't, wouldn't have produced a really good reaction, except maybe if you had access to Beatniks.And, what came after was driven by large-scale economic, technological (For example, the Pill), political decisions and disputes, and elite actions. One individual couldn't have changed anything.And, imagine living your life, knowing what your future would be like, and struggling against all of that to change it. It could have made your future desperate. Maybe, as Martin's Dad suggested, there is good reason not to try.Martin LevineWhat is like to be a diplomat stationed in a foreign capital while a violent coup is going on?November 17, 2018I actually had the experience while I was stationed at Manila:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/19...I was a Second Secretary at the Canadian Embassy in Manila, which was located in Makati, Manila's business district. The Embassy had put me, my now ex-wife and our one year old son, who was born in Manila, in a staff quarters in Urdaneta Village, a gated area in Makati, not very far from the Embassy. A staff quarters is local accommodation for an embassy family, provided by the embassy. Our SQ was an older bungalow, but quite pleasant, on a street full of similar bungalows.Quite unfortunately, as the Wikipedia article says:“Government forces recaptured all military bases save for Mactan Airbase by December 3, but rebel forces retreating from Fort Bonifacio occupied 22 high-rise buildings along the Ayala business area in Makati. The government claimed the coup was crushed, but fierce fighting continued through the weekend, with Camp Aguinaldo set ablaze by the rebel howitzers. The occupation of Makati lasted until December 7, while the rebels surrendered Mactan Airbase on December 9. The official casualty toll was 99 dead (including 50 civilians) and 570 wounded.”The twenty-two apartment buildings were in an area called Apartment Ridge, a few minutes walk from our SQ. (One of the embassy staff lived in one of the occupied buildings. The rebels took her hostage but were very courteous about it.) Occasionally, we would take the baby in a stroller and roll over to the Peninsula Hotel, part of a plush hotel chain, alongside the buildings, with a lavish lobby that served in part as a cafe.The rebels didn't occupy Urdaneta Village itself. Instead, they used it as a fire-over zone in a four day gun battle with the government forces, who were firing back from the other side. The Philippines is a lower-income country, but the two opposing forces were not low on bullets and mortar shells. The Philippine military had a decent fleet of armoured cars.Chuck Norris Decides What You ThinkNot long before the coup, a film was being shot in Urdaneta Village, where Chuck Norris was doing various American hero things about a military coup attempt in an underdeveloped tropical country. (If Chuck was being prescient, he could have shared!) I always felt that Chuck Norris was one career step behind Sly Stallone, but, certainly, he was a credible celebrity, for a teenaged boy from Oklahoma, and some of the rest of us. (OK, I admit it, all my Canadian supercilious, lefty-lib judgmental, political correctness couldn't stop me from thoroughly enjoying Chuck Norris films. Personally, I have great difficulty about singing Kumbaya and giving big hugs to people who are subjecting me to volleys of high-calibre weapons fire. I know that my fellow Canadians will not excuse my attitude, except for those who live in the Province of Alberta.)Strictly, speaking, I suppose that I should have been focused on the fact that I and my dependants were in imminent danger of being blown to bits. But, I could not stop thinking, what would Chuck do about this situation? What if I was Sly, and Chuck and I were in a duo, dispensing some Yanqui imperialism on the locals, for their own good?Nice, Clean CoupI think one of the issues that kept me from connecting to the reality that I was involved in, what I suppose I should have seen as, by far the worst calamity of my entire life, was that, other than for the bullets whistling immediately over our heads, that this was a fairly clean coup. There weren't dead bodies on the streets of Urdaneta Village. The mortar rounds were flying over our heads, not crashing down right into the village. The power stayed on for the first three of the four days we were trapped under fire. The telephones kept on working. My kid and I were watching cartoons at night, at the same time as watching the tracer bullets, and shells exploding against the side of buildings. (A very pretty sight, actually.)Of course I didn't have to go into the Embassy and do my sometimes tiring, badly overloaded visa work , with my miserably difficult supervisors, because even the Embassy had to agree that I likely would have died in the process of getting there. So, it was a few days off with the family.Our SQ was equipped with a big freezer in its own little room. We did the occasional run on the United States Embassy Commissary (In those Pre-Trumpian times, the American Embassy let us shop there.) We would stock up big. Also, the local synagogue (Yes, a fully-equipped Orthodox synagogue, within walking distance, even in the heat and drenching humidity, on the island of Luzon, in the Western Pacific. A miracle!) did the occasional kosher chicken run, I think from Melbourne, so we were religiously dietarily good to go.My ex-wife took the event in her stride. She was an Anglo-Jewish person, and like so many Anglo-Jews, tried to fit in to British life by out-Briting the Brits. So, her position was, that anything outside of the sceptered isle, was in any case, chaos and inferior. She felt that this incident proved her point. I don't think the baby much noticed except that Daddy seemed more relaxed then he did when he had to go in to work.You Guys Are Going To Get Blown To Hell, But Not UsOur family break came to an end on the fourth day. The Embassy called to point out that the rebels and the military were looking forward to having their climatic battle in Urdaneta Village, with a view to levelling the place and turning it into a free fire zone. They suggested we leave forthwith. The other Canadian Embassy families were living in another Makati village. The Embassy had organized a convoy to drive over to a seafront hotel in downtown Manila, outside of the battle zone. However, there were no other Canadian Embassy families in Urdaneta Village, so, as the Embassy put it, you are on your own. (The Missus and I were joking about how this probably reflected a certain old stock Canadian view that some of us ethnoculturals are highly expendable.) However, rather than being in a silly convoy with a bunch of fellow Canadian white flag wavers, it was more dignified to self-evacuate. My unreliable car was in the repair shop at the United States Embassy garage (For us, the United States Embassy was sort of a mini Fort Lauderdale.) However, in the meantime we were using a loaner car from our own embassy. At least, if we got bullet holes in the loaner car, it wouldn't be on my insurance.Driving in Manila is generally dangerous and frightening. The incoming rounds really didn't add much more to that. In fact, they were dampening the traffic down. The evacuation hotel was on Roxas Boulevard, not very far from our favourite, the United States Embassy, so we knew the various little side roads to squeeze through, trying to avoid the general Manila gridlock and occasional road rage gunfire. Since we were unbridled by the bureaucratic convoy (The other Canadians were probably arguing over the requisition form for the white flag, and who would get to waive it.) we got to the hotel first. They gave us a very nice room. Our Siamese cat was with us (Siamese cats understand very well about human stupidity.) The room was spacious and in no time we had the litter box set up, and our cat was chowing down on the tuna we had brought with us. (We had stocked up on cans.)Fun In The SunThe hotel was really very nice, a resort type, high end thing. We and our cat relaxed, and an hour or so later, we were waiving from our balcony, as the convoyed Canadians finally trickled in.Of course, the room and the meals, were at Embassy expense. Uniquely, for Canadian Embassy staff, this included a wide open bar tab. (There simply hadn't been time for the Embassy accounting section to figure out how to split off alcoholic beverages from food, coffee, bottled water and soft drinks.) I have commented in other Answers about how so many Canadians (Not me and mine. I teetotal, the wife seldom imbibed and we had to cut the baby off, because he was showing a disturbing fondness for kosher sacramental wine.) have some issues about the bottle, that is, after Mommy, the first love in their lives. My fellow Canadians quickly got calmed down, by drinking the hotel dry. They were easier to deal with then when they were at work. Then there was a dip in the pool, and, as I recall, the hotel had a Korean bulgogi restaurant.Do Americans Sometimes Dramatize In Inappropriate Situations?Had there only been Canadians at the hotel, the whole place would have been lulled into a drunken stupour. However, the hotel was a very big one. Various and assorted nationalities started to show up for refuge, or, really, mostly Americans.I think what really got them wound up was when CNN appeared. Who can miss such an opportunity? A whole lot of the Americans must have seen the Chuck and Sly films that are my guilty pleasure. You should have heard them declaiming! I swear there must have been a Hollywood scriptwriter back there. Some of the ladies obviously saw themselves as the female lead in a disaster film, and were presenting their narratives to CNN accordingly, gesticulating.CNN wanted the wife and baby to go on. However, my ex felt is was beneath their dignity. Stiff upper lip, and her parents back in Liverpool might have felt it was letting down the side.So, What Did I Learn From All Of This?I got a few days of combat pay from the Embassy. However, we aren't talking Israel here. If you are a Jewish male person from a humble, lower middle class background in Winnipeg, and it is not as a result of having immigrated to Israel, why is it that you are getting combat pay? Should you rethink you career choice?Let Chuck Norris be Chuck Norris. You are not Chuck Norris.In real life situations of this kind, beautiful young women do not proclaim you as their hero, and then offer themselves to you. Had one done so, my ex-wife, who had a bad temper, would have resorted to violence that would have scared the Filipinos into declaring peace.Watch CNN. Do not be on CNN. If you are being covered by CNN, and it is not because you are involved in a major league sports event, you are doing something terribly wrong. Stop it immediately.If you are wondering what it is like to be someone involved in a military coup attempt in a Third World country, watch a film on cable TV, almost anything done by Chuck or Sly, except Rocky Balboa, in your living room, back home in Winnipeg. Then shovel some snow, have a cup of tea and go to bed. As you drowse off, be very grateful that you are living in the best place on Earth.OK, the coup was interesting. It was an experience and maybe a little enjoyable. It was a nice break and time at home with the family. It confirmed some of my favourite biases. I was more worried about my family getting killed, more than me, myself. But, at least it was a result of trying to make a living to support them. I am really sorry that people got killed, but I didn't do anything to provoke it. Eventually, the United States Government intervened, but it was with jet fighters buzzing downtown Manila, not with Chuck and Sly administering some behave yourself, in-person, corrections.I was younger then. In those days Canadians weren't allowed to have post traumatic stress disorder. Just think if they were! I could have had a few years off from work, with full pay, and no visas to grind out.I didn't hit the times just right, but my loved ones and I got to walk away in one piece. I like to think that Chuck would have given me the high sign of approval.Martin LevineDo you believe that CANZUK will happen post-Brexit?November 13, 2018At least for Canada, probably not.Of course, it depends how extensive CANZUK would be. If it just a general expression of good wishes, a search for enhanced trade ties, tourism and student exchanges, why not? I think that is as far as Canada could go.There are a few reasons for this. Some of them have to do concern how Canada's elites see their own interests and how they run the country.Britain Is Too Much Of A Wild CardWere CANZUK to consist of the United Kingdom, Australia, New Zealand, the United Kingdom would have a majority of the population. This would preclude the existence of any multinational Parliament, the way the European Union has one. Any agreement would have to have structures so that Britain's population is not given any more power than that of any of the other three members. Effectively, Britain would have to submit itself to yet another multinational entity that they would not see as democratic. I suspect that, after Brexit, many British people will be looking for ways to enhance their national pride, sovereignty and power, not re-restrict it.Britain appears to be crawling towards a Hard Brexit. Even supporters of Hard Brexit acknowledge that, at least for a while, Britain will have an economic rough ride. The Government of Canada will want nothing to do with it. Before negotiating anything, they will probably want to see a few years of dust settling, before negotiating any tighter arrangements with Britain.This will impact any discussion about the free movement of people. In addition to Britain having the largest part of CANZUK's entire population, it would have the largest part of the labour force. What will happen if there is a surge of unemployment in Britain? Canada will not grant the unemployed population of Britain an opportunity to freely come here and seek opportunities. As I have said in some other Answers, a lot of the best opportunities here are for lower-skilled and trades labour and are not necessarily located in the biggest cities. Opportunities in the more highly-paid occupations, in, Toronto, Vancouver and Calgary, are scarce. Canada does not need a surge of stockbrokers and IT and AI experts from Britain, certainly not to those cities. There might be some opportunities, but the standard immigration protections, to protect Canadian workers, will not be relinquished.Immigration, No Exemptions!The Commonwealth preferences for immigration to Canada ceased fifty or more years ago. In the late 1950's and 1960's Canada brought the White Canada immigration selection system to an end. The current, points-based system began in the 1960's and is still with us. So is the concept that Canadian immigration is broken out into the different classes, Skilled Workers, Family Class, Refugees and Business Immigrants. For a while, Canada controlled total annual immigration by limiting the numbers of visa officers posted overseas. Then, it instituted the annual levels system, a formal commitment to Parliament, to only admit a certain number of immigrants, divided out by class, every calendar year.Canada has long restricted entries to the country under Work Permits, nowadays relatively tightly, by requiring employers to demonstrate that there is no suitable Canadian citizen or permanent resident they can hire. Exemptions are made only for certain types of occupations, or, for example, for limited-period student and young adult reciprocal exchanges. Canada has for many years resisted the creation of a long-stay, non-citizen, non-resident population. (This is in part because of the highly negative European Gastarbeiter (guest worker) situation. ) That won't change.The federal government of Canada allows Quebec and the other provinces to operate parts of the immigration selection and Work Permit systems. However, there are parameters. No province is going to introduce blanket exemptions on the basis of nationality.This whole selection and control system employs large numbers of federal and provincial bureaucrats. The federal departments of Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada and Employment and Social Development Canada (which is responsible for labour markets) would be consulted about any CANZUK free movement of labour. So will their provincial counterparts. The response from these bureaucracies will be a resounding and convincing, no!No Disruptions To Central Financial ControlIn Canada, only the federal government can charter banks. Banking charters are not easily issued, particularly for competitors to the traditional full-service banks. In fact, the retail banking industry in Canada is dominated by the Big Five, nation-wide, bricks and mortar banks. They are all based within a convenient few blocks of each other, in the downtown Toronto business district. The federal government similarly maintains tight control over insurance and pension companies that operate in more than one province. In turn, the relatively small number of big banks, insurance and pension administrators are very influential with the federal government.Canada would not participate in any CANZUK that changes that. It does not matter what country it is, their banks, insurance and pension companies will not be allowed to take a major role here.Canadian Workers Will Be Kept In Their PlaceJust think of it, Regina on a January morning. It is minus forty on either temperature scale, with a stiff wind. Or, you are toughing out a multi-day Prairie Blizzard. Or, you are in Toronto, covered with slush, maximum humidity, a stiff wind off of Lake Ontario, freezing rain and a commute to work that will take you an hour and a half on a nasty day.But then, you suddenly think, I can move to Adelaide! You no longer need a visa and a Work Permit, or to pass the Australian points selection system. Get your passport! Get on the plane! The shrimp and the barbie are waiting at the other end!Canadian employers won't at all like it. They already know they are lucky that the Americans won't let us in. Otherwise, watch some of your best, most ambitious, young, skilled Canadian workers, depart for San Antonio, Albuquerque and San Diego. They know, free movement of labour between Canada and another developed country equipped with eight month summers and palm trees, is going to be bad for them. In order to preserve the sanctity of their labour supply, Canada needs to be a little bit of a prison.Talk To The Provinces, If They WillThose employers have some helpful prison guards, the provincial and territorial governments. The federal government controls the professional requirements for only a limited range of occupations. It is the provincial governments that control most. Not infrequently they delegate the regulation and access to an occupation by means of provincial professional and trades organizations. Their primary purpose is to protect jobs for their existing members. Setting various requirements to exclude foreign workers is a pillar of this strategy.The provincial governments also control access to business licences and can control foreign property ownership.The federal government cannot make the provinces loosen their grip. They cannot impose national standards for occupations and trades, that could be reconciled with those of Britain, Australia and New Zealand. Even if they could, the local backlash would be formidable. I can't see the federal government being able to use any power of suasion. It is too much of a risk for the provinces. Open, reciprocal professional and business access is nothing that they would take on.So, No One Would Like It?I can think of some Canadian groups who would like to take it and run with it:-Those young, highly skilled, palm tree seeking Canadians.-Even working class, not so skilled people, if they could afford the ticket. If they had the same entitlement to social assistance and housing as Australians and New Zealanders did, why not live on the beach, do some waitressing, tend bar, bounce in nightclubs, deliver pizza, etc.-Retired Canadians with resources, who will never have to worry about the USA cutting off their snowbird access again. What about a pleasant environment, in a regional, low-priced town in Queensland, but big enough to have a full service hospital. That might be a serious competitor to Mexico or Peru.-Ambitious businesspeople who feel confident, who want to expand their businesses or do business anywhere.-Old stock Canadians who miss the British tie and aren't so keen on French.And, Some Would Like It, Even If One Would Think They Wouldn't-Quebec has a fairly effective screen against labour market swamping, you have to speak French. And, there are plenty of bilingual francophone French people, who might love an experience overseas.-Some Answerers call CANZUK an attempt to revive the Commonwealth of the White Dominions. But, all four countries are multiracial nowadays. If you are a British migrant from Manchester, you have a very good chance of being a person of colour. I am not sure this would be so objectionable to Canadians of colour.The Top Wouldn't Like ItIn Canada, like anywhere else, some people are a lot more equal than others.If one compiled my list of Canadians who might like CANZUK, or who wouldn't object after all, there are a lot of Canadians. But, I don't think the federal government would ever hold a binding plebiscite.Rich Canadians who want to live and do business overseas, can do it. CANZUK would have a minimal benefit for them. In fact, CANZUK would dilute, being a Canadian living overseas, as an elite privilege.The most powerful and influential groups and people in Canada would generally have little to gain. They also know how to manipulate public opinion. If the federal Government of Canada looked like they were considering CANZUK, I can just imagine the add campaign. Coronation Street come to oppress us, be proudly working class and lower our standards of living. Or, you think you want to live in Sydney, have a look at these housing prices! Or, forget about that shrimp on the barbie. Fear the bikies, you will lose your shirt at the pokies and your morals will be hopelessly corrupted by that legal bordello!I wish the British people all the best, but do not expect anything significant from Canada, and definitely, no CANZUK, no matter whether a lot of Canadians would welcome it, or not!Martin LevineWhy was George Orwell so pessimistic and dreary even after the Allies won WW2? (1984 was published in 1949). The rest of the West, it seems, was in a state of celebration.November 5, 2018I sometimes wonder, what would the world have been like, if George Orwell hadn't written his convincing, frightening depiction of the future? I don't know how much attention “1984” got outside of the English-speaking world. However, the depiction of Big Brother Watching You, was a powerful one that many people understood. We still see Big Brother doing his best to do just that.Another Answer commented about the miserable circumstances of George Orwell's personal life. George Orwell was only forty-six when he died in 1950. Say, for the sake of argument, he had lived to the age of seventy-five, and passed on in 1978. Would he have written a sequel where Winston Smith dodges Big Brother, figures out some way to talk the “unpersoning” computer that he gives voice commands to at work, so that it blows up, which results in Oceania collapsing as a regime? In other words, he writes a triumphant Star Trek scenario. What if he had actually got a contract with Paramount Studios, moved to a villa in Beverly Hills, and wrote the screenplays for various Star Trek episodes? I can envision him hanging out with Hugh Hefner at the Playboy Mansion, and getting an interview published in Playboy Magazine, explaining his way out of why his desperate prediction about the British future didn't happen.Dismal BritainGeorge Orwell was writing about British things. The United Kingdom had emerged from the Second World War in a mess. It took them years for their economy to recover. Their massive colonial empire was on its way to dwindling. World War II did nothing to resolve the country's historic class differences, other than to prioritize the devising of ways to alleviate the suffering of the working class, by means of a social safety net.Looking at it from strictly a British point of view, in 1949, “1984” was a plausible scenario. What if the country had not eventually had a strong economic recovery, and a great expansion of British consumerism? What, if the National Health Service and Council Housing had not become principal features of British life? It isn't hard to imagine the upper class retrenching into a totally self-serving stance. (Casinos in London, squandering Britain's scarce foreign exchange on luxury goods and foreign holidays, while much of the rest of the population remained at the level of Wigan Pier.) The Labour Party wasn't devoid of authoritarian-minded socialists. Maybe, after a decade or so of severe deprivation, loyalty to the Crown wouldn't have sufficed, and there would have been a popular uprising. The elite of the new regime might have copied Stalinism, and imposed a very severe authoritarian regime, on a relatively small island country with limited resources. They could have imposed a strict information control regime.We aren't however sure how realistic “1984” was intended to be. Even without a revolution, Britain could have remained a sad, worn down place. Orwell wanted social reform. Maybe he believed that a good scare would stimulate some changes. Orwell was a brilliant writer. So, he was able to imagine a terrifying (And consequently dramatic, and therefore saleable.) scenario, do excellent character development in describing Winston Smith, and give people a really good, thought-provoking read. What if he had lived even a decade longer and saw the royalties and fame roll in? By 1955 he might have been too jolly to write anything sad anymore.In The Real World, Britain Wasn't The PointHaving lived in Britain, reminding British people that Britain isn't very prominent in the modern world, can still cause a lot of pain. Perhaps a victorious Brexit is a final national fantasy about, for better or for worse, Britain being seriously powerful in the world.I don't think that George Orwell could have written a more realistic, but still dystopic novel about a less British-oriented nightmare world and got any major publisher to deal with it. A plenty terrifying, but less marketable scenario might have been, in the year 1984, what was once the United Kingdom is a protectorate of a United States sort of fascist empire, straddling everything from the shores of Western Europe up to and including Japan, Australia and New Zealand. This was the result of a United States Senator, who formulated a convincing conspiracy theory about communistic subversion of the United States and its traditional values, devised by Russia so as to weaken America, and make it vulnerable to a transoceanic Russian and Chinese attack. Perhaps the Senator is a more Trumpian, more impressive presenter than Joseph McCarthy, and masters the new medium of television. Being a good organizer, he assembles street fighting and assassination squads of Ku Klux Klanners, and recruits any other racist, anti-semitic, violently psychopathic and just plain opportunistic people. (Yes, the early days of Hitler.). He himself has deniability. In the meantime his violent action wing recruits the pre-reformation George Wallace, Bull Connor, various evangelists and country music figures, plus a whole lot of other people who would have been happy to join as, as deputies. Then, there are big business business figures who have had quite enough of the AFL-CIO, and would have made some serious donations to the cause. Then our Senator runs for President and gets elected.Re-title “1984” as “2018” and we aren't so unrealistic after all, are we? It is just that we have an American based nightmare, Big Brother in a cowboy hat, with a guitar, sort of a very evil Roy Rogers.But, Watch That Perpetual War1949 was probably too early for George Orwell to have envisioned a nuclear deterrent based on intercontinental ballistic missiles and full mutually agreed destruction. His scenario was human civilization, persisting in an absolutely horrible way. Had he lived up to the 1960's, he would not have been interested in writing a sort of Doctor Strangelove. (The British working class and the outer party wouldn't have been around for perpetual suffering, had the world been reduced to a nuclear cinder.) The world's remaining superpowers shooting missiles with conventional warheads at each other's territories, or engaging in direct conflict, would have been a too dangerous pathway to escalation. (Unless however, there is an absolutely cynical, very carefully concealed world government of the severe authoritarians, making the whole conflict up.) Perhaps proxy wars could have been enough, with the authoritarian empires accusing each other of supporting client countries who produce weapons of mass destruction. However, it would have required coalitions of the non-willing to keep control, with troops of the puppet colony that had replaced the United Kingdom, incurring heavy casualties while under the command and control of American Empire generals, just to to help keep those proxies honest.First Culture, Then Very Mean GlobalismWould Eurasia have been symbolized by the ostentatiously Jewish Emmanuel Goldstein? If Eurasia was meant to have been a triumphant expansion of Stalinist Russia, then no, certainly not.The Soviet Union was a Russian expression. It kept Russian culture under authoritarian control, but there was no intention of eliminating it, in favour of some sort of European-Asian mix. The sole official language would have been Russian, with maybe a limited tolerance of local languages in some of the conquered provinces, until Russianization was complete. Russia, even a very totalitarian Russia, wasn't going to share any cultural space with France, Germany, Italy, etc. The effect of Eurasia would have been the Russian language, and a highly, highly controlled version of Russian culture, right up to the English Channel.And, in a real Oceania, would the headquarters of any government ministries have been in London? No, no way. Bull Connor would have had none of that, nor would the Grand Old Opry. More likely Winston Smith would have had his outer party job, after forcefully being relocated to Dallas. Just think of it, people living half-starved on the streets, violent police forces equipped with military surplus equipment, the inner party headquarters elite living in gated communities. Cultural prole food would have consisted of sexually suggestive music videos, to the effect of, obey the party and you get this.By, say 1955, George Orwell might have had to write a different type of future dystopia about Britain. London might have been just a military-industrial encampment, with no administrative functions at all. In fact the evangelical, country music, Hollywood under strict control community, might have proposed another plan to Big Brother President. Kidnap residents of the now Fully Manifestly-Destined Latin America and forceably transport them to Britain, so as to dilute any remainders of British culture right out of existence.This would have worked to give British people an awful scare, and sold very well in the British book market. The fear America scenario might have been awfully attractive. However, in the America of 1955, no American publisher of any consequence would have dared to market it.A Healthy George OrwellBy 1949 George Orwell was dying of tuberculosis. He lived just long enough to take advantage of a culture window of opportunity, a plausible scenario of a perpetually impoverished but still very influential Britain. What if he had been cured? He probably couldn't have run the same book by 1955. It would not have been plausible.Doubtless, Orwell could still have written a great book about a dystopic future. We do not know for sure, but I think he would have known what to write, in order to produce a very, very influential book, at least for the British market.We don't know whether a healthier, surviving George Orwell would have been interested in writing for the international English-reader market. He was a very British person, writing with social concern about Britain.If he did make that leap, it would have been very difficult for him to write a very dystopic book about the English-speaking world in general, at least until the early 1960's. That type of book could not have been publishable in America.However, think of him as a writer in residence, resting his lungs in the warm climate of say, the University Of California at Berkeley. In the early 1960's he could have started up some writing about a dystopic world with much of it under American domination. During the cultural revolution of the 1960's it would have worked and sold big.In the meantime, I could imagine him writing articles for the New York Times, the Atlantic Monthly, and other sorts of publications that so many 2018 Americans just love to hate. Maybe he could have invented words equivalent to his 1984 unperson ones, to describe a terrifying near future America. If he could have retained his pessimism, amid being in good health, getting published a lot and making a decent amount of money, he might even have put his British life behind him, and had a substantial cultural influence on the USA, rather than Britain.Martin LevineIf the NDP (a leftist party) won the next Canadian election, would the United States punish Canada? If so, how?October 29, 2018I don't think there is any chance of the NDP winning the October, 2019 federal election. In fact, unless they become a very different party, I doubt they can win any federal election. However this is too interesting of a question to pass on. It causes us to think about a few aspects of Canada's relations with the USA.As another Answer pointed out, the NDP, unless currently, isn't a far left party. However, how well that would be understood in the USA is another question. The American electorate hasn't shown that much sophistication in differentiating between mild social democracy and outright authoritarian socialism.Since the next federal election is next year, presumably the current American administration would be dealing with such an event. (Unless of course things like impeachment or onset dementia interfere.) We do not of course know what the composition of the next Congress will be. The United States Senate and the House of Representatives are not as strict in party discipline as our Parliament. I suspect it would have more to do with the attitude and concerns of individual members of the two houses of Congress, rather than a Republican or Democratic Party line.What Happens When Canada Crosses The American Consciousness Threshold?I contend that the threshold for general American consciousness about anything in Canada is rather high. There is a distinct tendency to see Canada as something not worth seeing. Since Canada is seen as non-threatening and unimportant, and not different in any substantial way from the USA, why would it need attention?However, that is the general American attitude. The business community in particular, has corporate executives who are very interested in Canada. These are the companies that have branch operations in Canada and that trade with Canada. They are also companies that tend to be politically quite influential. This could either moderate or exacerbate any American response. If the corporate executives are knowledgeable enough about Canadian politics to understand that the NDP is a rhetoric-oriented party, they might suggest that no special American response is required, unless the NDP federal government does something bad. However, if these are executives who are not informed about Canada, or hate what they see, they may do their very best to convey their alarm to the White House.The current White House has some individual actors who themselves might have a very low threshold for Canada doing or being anything that they don't like. Imagine how Larry Kudlow would respond to the new Jagmeet Singh government! (Presuming he is still party leader.) Sadly, they might take even the turban as a sort of foreign slap against the Trump administration.Then, if any individual commentator on FOX TV becomes aware of the Canadian regime change, Canada might have some serious public relations problems. Just imagine, “Socialism conquers the North”, “The communistic enemy stands on our northern frontier.” If FOX wanted to get visual and sensationalist (Not impossible, is it?) they might want to do a little paranoia filming in Canada, a few Arabic-language business signs in South Ottawa, an enthusiastic NDP campaign rally in an ethnocultural area of Toronto, some college campus alternative types being triumphant, Syrian refugees smiling here and there, a glowing endorsement from the feminist organizations of Canada, a street, light-up weed festival, in honour of Canada's new era, civil servant unionists jumping for joy, (particularly the schoolteachers) etc. Then, be imaginative and do some outright lying about the socialist NDP being buddy, buddy, with the Communist Party of the People's Republic of China.That type of coverage will turn some cranks in mid-America, in fact lots of cranks. En masse, those cranks will turn some political cranks.So, Who Does The NDP's Talking?Generally, provincial NDP governments know to keep the rhetoric right down. They don't want to start the business community fleeing the province. If they want to win any further elections, they need to do a lot of reaching out and reassurances. Every one of these NDP governments will have a competent communications unit. We will see pictures of the provincial NDP leader, in a tailored business suit, conferring with local business leaders. NDP provincial governments learned some of these tactics the hard way.But, there hasn't been an NDP federal government before. They would not have any governmental, corporate communications memory. I think there would be a messaging struggle within that new government.What happens if the more dogmatic messengers win? One could hope that the federal NDP would hire some of the top communications advisors from provincial NDP's. But, what if they don't?I refer back to the old 1970's Waffle, that part of the federal NDP who wanted to nationalize all kinds of things, just to get the Americans out. They wanted a socialistic, neutral Canada. Individual Waffle members kept it up, long after the Waffle got expelled from the NDP, and, on its own, dissolved. I can foresee Waffle, the Next Generation, energized and trying to again take up the NDP ideological leadership.Imagine their first communique, a critique of anything to do with the USA, NORAD, NATO, corporate Canada, demands for total gender equality, and, if there is a Jason Kenney government in Alberta by then, declare a federal-provincial relations war. And, how about re-opening the Constitution and eliminating the Notwithstanding Clause?We had best hope the American media does not notice. It would give even CBS and CNBC apoplexy. The American social media response would be appalling and, even divisive among Americans. From the Alt-Right, “Pick up the gun, the Canuck commies are around the corner.”, and from the Sandering left, “Let's do just like them.”My concern is that the new NDP government would permanently push Canada over the American recognition threshold. That high threshold generally serves us well. What if they watch us like they watch Mexico? It would be a NAFTA-style crisis every month. We have achieved a relationship where the US Administration and American movers and shakers mostly notice Canada when we want them to. The NDP might push the American powers that be, into a permanent, Trumpian-type hyper awareness of Canada. Even the Trumpian base might be permanently aroused to notice us, and blame Canada for real, all the time.So, What Would The Americans Do?Whip Up The MassesThe current American administration has shown us, hating on people is a pretty good way to win elections. During the NAFTA negotiations, they were successful in convincing a sizable part of the American public that Canadian dairy farmers were demonic. Just think of the fun they could have with the socialistic, hostile NDP Canadian government.No More Hands Across The BorderWe are presuming that the new USMCA agreement will have been approved by Congress by October, 2019. If, by some chance, it isn't, it probably won't be. I don't think that even the more liberal Democrats would be willing to help out. Even if USMCA is approved, the USA might pretend it will again pull out. They might demand all sorts of things not to do that, more quotas on Canadian goods, more tariffs, and an end to free labour movement provisions from Canada to the USA, to the extent it exists.It could get a lot worse than that. Our Canadian governments do a lot of borrowing from American sources. Our companies look for infusions of capital from American investors. Would the American administration use the national security club to beat it all down?I don't think Canadian participation in NORAD would have much of a future. And the current co-operation at the border, pre-clearance arrangements, the exchange of information between the US and Canadian border authorities, the exchange of intelligence information, might be gone.What Could That New NDP Government Do?The NDP, federal and provincial has done some very good things to make Canada a better place. In some ways I would like to see an NDP federal government.Perhaps if the Obama government was still there, Jagmeet Singh could have met with President Obama in the first week, with a package of reassurances and commitments to the Canadian-American relationship. Then there would be a shake hands photo op, and Prime Minister Singh saying very reassuring things to the White House press corps. That is not a possibility anymore.I would not be optimistic about a new NDP federal government being able to handle the American situation. I think it is only an outside chance that the new government would issue a call-up to NDP advisors and communicators at the provincial level. They already have a lot of people who want to give a whole lot of advice.I am not at all sure that the NDP wouldn't be re-Waffled. Ideologues at the left end of the Canadian political perspective don't necessarily have job security and the greatest incomes. If my side had won, I would be pushing very hard for myself, never mind my ideology.The NDP doesn't have that much of a well-elaborated strategy about how to make nice with the USA. It isn't clear that there would be an in-group of federal NDP leaders, who would push the new Waffle out, the way they did in the 1970's NDP. The most strident voices would talk loud, and demand “their nominees” be put in positions of authority. Once those nominees were in, they would want to cater to those who supported them. I don't think a federal NDP would be able or willing to copy strategies like those of the provincial NDP's, moderacy, social democracy and not socialism, friendship with small businesspeople, promoting foreign trade, labour market-oriented immigration, etc. There would just be far too much temptation to keep on campaigning against the USA.In fact, I think this is one of the reasons why the NDP cannot win a federal election. Particularly now, many Canadians want to avoid any further grief with the USA. They can be fairly sure that the Liberal and Conservative Parties will both prioritize, happy, low profile relationships with any American administration, Congress, American big business and any other Americans who happen to notice us. However they NDP is an American relationship wildcard. I think that enough NDP'ers feel that, any endorsement of the USA, is self betrayal. I don't think that can change.Martin LevineWhether you be conservative or liberal or lean to one side or the other, what keeps you voting the way you do? In regard to agenda, upbringing, etc?October 27, 2018I should start by saying that, as a matter of principle, it is important to vote. There are a lot of countries where people aren't allowed to vote. We should never forget to be grateful that we should live in a country where people can. And, if you didn't vote, why are you complaining?It Depends A Lot On How You Get To VoteIn order to explain why I vote the way I do, I should explain that I am voting within the Canadian system. There are three levels of government in Canada, not including indigenous ones. Federal, provincial and municipal elections have different issues. In Canada you do not “register” as a member of a party, although you can buy a party membership if you want to. I do not believe in voting a party line at all three levels of government. Some Canadian municipalities, including Ottawa, do not have formal party politics at the municipal level.In Canada, in federal and provincial elections, you do not vote directly for the head of the executive branch. I do not get to vote for any individual to be the Prime Minister of Canada, or a provincial Premier. I am voting for who will represent my particular geographic constituency in the federal House of Commons or the provincial legislature. I have to consider whether the local candidate is any good. But, still, I know that, if the party that candidate represents, gains a majority of the seats in the House or the legislature, a particular individual is going to be Prime Minister or Premier.Essentially, at the federal and provincial level, I have three concerns going on before I even think in detail about policies and platforms:-What do I think about my local candidate?-What do I think about their party?-What do I think about their party leader?My one vote has to cover all three concerns.For non-Canadians, Canada does not have recall elections. Plebiscites (propositions in the USA) are only sparingly used. Other than members of the legislature and the school boards, other official positions are not elective, they are civil service ones or appointive. (Canadians don't vote for judges or police chiefs.) Party discipline on votes in the legislature is very tight. Unless it is what we call a “free vote”, where each member of the legislature may vote as they wish, all members must vote according to their party line. If they don't, after maybe one warning, that member may be expelled from Caucus. (That is, from party membership in the legislature. They would have to sit as an independent.) A member may very possibly be expelled from their party for publicly disagreeing with the party platform, or criticizing the party leader, or for criticizing any other member of their party in the legislature. The system does not tolerate rogues.Another issue a Canadian voter ought to think about is, should a party win the majority of seats and form a government, who are the cabinet ministers going to be? By convention, in British parliamentary systems, cabinet ministers have to be elected members of the legislature. The Prime Minister selects members of his party in the legislature to do the Cabinet jobs. So, should that party win, does that party have members competent enough to be in Cabinet? It can be a major issue in a lot of Canadian political commentaries.In this type of context, a Canadian may want to look at the whole party as a functional unit for government. Overall, can they do a competent job of governing? What is their talent lineup? Since Canada is very provincially and regionally-oriented, were that party in government, would they have enough members of the legislature from all across Canada to understand the needs of the whole country? Do they screen their candidates well enough to avoid unpleasant surprises. (Sometimes, parties get caught out for really poor candidate selection. They end up presenting someone with a history of racist or misogynistic Facebook comments and tweets. Or, they offer up someone with a bad business record. Then, they say, well, we just didn't notice and we will do better the next time. Why would I believe that?)I Am In It For The MoneyA formal provincial Premier said it very succinctly, when commenting about some of his members of the legislature. “It was the best job they ever had.” There are a fair number of politicians who seek incumbency because it is the best salary and benefits they are going to make, and it will lead to an excellent pension. It can get apparent when a given party is carrying a lot of people like that on its roster. Why should voters need them?In municipal politics it frankly gets worse. Municipal politics are the bottom rung of the Canadian political register. I hate to say it, but some of the politicians and people who run for political office are bottom rung people. You see them in Ottawa. They will fight, fight, fight for anything in their own constituency, without regard to the city as a whole. Maybe some of it is out of conviction, but some of it is, scraping up enough votes in every election to stay in office until pension time rolls around. Incumbency matters a lot in municipal politics. Get elected once, play your cards right, and you are on a roll.And, maybe school boards are one rung beneath city council. Ottawa just recently had its municipal elections. Of the candidates in my part of town that put up campaign signs, one had a web site. I did not get one leaflet through the door. The website candidate had a nice slogan on his campaign signs about helping special needs children. That sounded nice so I voted for him.But Then, Ideology?I actually go through the above criteria first. If a party can not or will not present competent, well-intentioned candidates, then it doesn't matter what their platform is. If I like their platform, then they will discredit it.No Party Represents MeI would consider it a sad personal day if I ever started to identify any given political party with myself. I do not want or expect any political party to represent the core of my being. Any political party in Canada, with a hope of taking office, needs to represent a grab bag of different groups and individuals. That party has to do some twisting and turning to make itself electable. It needs to cater to those parts of Canada, or a province, where the majority of the population, and so the majority of the seats, are concentrated. My political philosophy about that is, such is political life. If I like that party enough to vote for them, I wan them to show me, what is your something for everybody strategy?The Things Our Politicians Can Only Lightly Touch, Or Not At AllGenerally, everywhere, not that many people can escape taxes (Except really skillful tax evaders, or those at the very top.) I enjoy evidence-based posts about the supernatural, but my working thesis is that nobody escapes death.But, I contend that, in the world of Canada, there are other carved in stone realities that transcend anybody's politics, unless your politics consist of a violent revolution. The big five banks, the Toronto Stock Exchange and the big insurance companies will call a lot of the shots. A natural tendency of all Canadian bureaucracies is to behave like sludge. (In other Answers, I have explained why I, as a retired bureaucrat, see it that way.) Provinces will fight the federal government, because it is putting on a good show for the local electorate. American influences will always push. (Americans, no, I am not being rude. The USA is next door and has a population and economy ten times Canada's size. You are going to push even when you don't want to.) Canada's bilingualism and biculturalism are a basis, not debatable. Canadians tend to love home ownership and, a whole lot of them would live in suburbs even if it wasn't so expensive to live downtown. Canadians are not scared of debt, they want nice things, and they will run up their credit cards and credit lines.For a political party to be credible to me, it has to show me how it wraps itself around these immovable pillars of Canadian life. If they can't cope with any of them, then they, meaning either their leaders, their membership or both, are fantacizing. No, we are not going to have a socialist Canada. No, Quebec is not going to be quiet and it doesn't seem much interested in going away. No, their isn't any way to help Canada's ecology by reproaching the suburbanites and insisting they move downtown to a college dorm. No, Canadians won't give up driving cars. No, you are not going to convince me to only like women. No, I am not an old stock Canadian and so, put up with me. That isn't subject to your politics.Money Makes The World Go RoundIt sure does in Canada, federally, provincially and municipally. So, political party, tell me how you are going to manage that? If you have nothing to suggest, I won't vote for you.So, My Politics?This Question mentions upbringing. Mine was, down in a crouch. My numerous comments about my childhood ethno-Winnipeg explain whySo, what I am looking for:-Please keep this place quiet. In my opinion, it is good to give people in need a hand up. But, the social safety net is also my personal defence line. When people get angry, my ethnocultural group is near the top of who gets the blame, and they insist all of us responsible.-Watch out for the bullies, the humiliators, the enforcers and the influencers. Being a non-drinking, no Christmas, sports adverse, bisexual Jew, I have encountered far too many in my personal life. In my opinion Canada (Not unlike some other places) has a real problem with this. There are far too many of them. I don't care what the excuse is, not even the primacy of the National Hockey League and the beer commercials. Any party with a strategy for stopping them, maybe a good assemblage of human rights, anti-discrimination laws and reasonable political correctness, is good for me.-And watch out for the control freaks. Some of our politician get their joy out of making the rest of us dance. Shot calling is why they are in the political business. I am not sure that they that much care about what they are forcing you to do, as long as they can force you to do it.Maybe my politics are kind of negative because they talk a lot about what I don't want. But, I love politics that enable me to say, “No, I won't do that. No, you and me are not we. No, I don't care what you think about me and no, stop trying to impress me with your self-confident demeanour. Just tell me what you propose to do about all this stuff, and how much it is going to cost”Martin LevineIs Canadian Martin Levine building an encyclopedia with his extensive answers to questions?October 25, 2018Presumably I am the Canadian Martin Levine being referred to. So I will indulge myself in a Canadianism, Oh cummon, eh! However I actually don't use “eh” anymore. The Americans made too much fun of it, so I got self-conscious. And also, I do not pronounce “about”, “aboot”! I have an urbane, Winnipeg accent. Us urbane Winnipeggers (Or expat-urbane-Winnipeggers like me) know a whole lot better then that. You want to fit in when you do your junket to Las Vegas, not sound like a Frozen North alien.Google It!Some questions that I see in Quora, don't need to be questions in Quora, things like , “Is Alaska in the USA”. I am sometimes tempted to write a one line Answer to tell people, “Look it up!”, but what for? These could be troll questions or questions from people who lack knowledge, and are unfamiliar with searching the Web for information. There is no need to humiliate them.Extensive Works For MeYou can get a decent mental stretch if you decide to write a few pages. But, beyond that, I am old, I have travelled a lot and have seen various and assorted things. I also have a Master's Degree from a reputable Canadian university. It was seriously hard to get. My degree was in Canadian Studies, in my case a combination of sociology and history. These are not disciplines where you can express yourself in tweets.And, I will repeat what I said a few days ago, the closer one gets to a society or culture, the less homogeneous you realize it is. In fairness, you need to qualify your statements about any given nationality. I apply that principle to myself too. I contend that there is no, one, Canadian society or Canadian culture. This means explaining why. I find that, not infrequently, I am justifying why it is OK for a Canadian to self identify as a “white ethnic”. Even when you say it to another Canadian, you can get a negative reaction.Canada is not an especially well known or understood country in the world. A historian once referred to Canada as a country existing in America's shadow. Some of the Questions we see in Quora show a great ignorance about Canada. It takes some paragraphs to provide basic facts. One of the things I am trying to do is to describe a Canada that doesn't cause any real reason for tears or fears, except for other Canadians. I am trying to convince, frankly Americans, that Canada is a bona fide foreign country and Canadians are, really, aliens. It takes explanation why, and I try to provide links to Canadian sources, for those who are motivated enough to read a couple of pages. My other assertion is that, once you accept that Canada is a foreign country, full of aliens, you are going to realize how harmless Canadians are.Canadian Me Is Not Canadian Me“Canadian Martin Levine”, is that it? I am a Canadian citizen. But then, there is are other ways I describe myself. I have spent many paragraphs explaining why. I don't see any shortcuts.If I wanted to give a one liner about describing myself, it is, Jewish Winnipeg old bisexual me. Obviously the Canadian part of me is important, but, what I am saying is, you learn your identity, in stages. For me, it was Jewish, then here I am in Winnipeg, Manitoba, then, “Not every place is as cold as here, really?”, then learning about the political concept of Manitobanness, inside Canadianness, then, around when I turned eleven, I noticed I had a gender issue. Later on, I learned that Manitoba really is just one part of Canada and that the other parts were very different.All these learning experiences occurred before the onset of nice, lefty-lib Canada. I find myself having to explain, I am not the Canadian leftist you want to talk about. I have my explanation of how that lefty lib Canada that the Trump Administration, and others, like to negativize about, came into being. I am making a rebuttal. You can't do that in a couple of paragraphs.People First, Aliens LaterMy Answers are also a statement. People are people before they are nationals of any given country. No nationality entitles anyone to deference, and nationality should never stop anybody from talking to anybody. I have had very well-intentioned, very respectful Americans tell me that they can't comment about Canadians because Canadians are foreigners. My return message is, don't worry about it! Bring it on! Ask, argue, debate! However, my suggestion is that, do a little bit of research first. The information is all there on the Web.It is like asking someone to do a mental exercise. Look at the foreigner over there, certainly a serious alien. That foreigner lives an hours drive north of you. The foreigner speaks the same language as you do, runs a car, shops at big box stores, works for some business and commutes. That foreigner votes in elections and goes on those Las Vegas junkets. Now that I have gone into some details about how that foreigner lives, tell me why you think that foreigner is above all, an alien, rather than just somebody with a different passport. I write at length, so you can do it too.Canadians Behaving BadlyI contend that Canadians don't know each other, and that most assertions about any one Canadian identity or supposedly one set of Canadian values, are an act of aggression. At the last Canadian federal election, the Conservative Party proposed a “barbaric cultural practises” hot line, that real Canadians could call anonymously, to report ethnics and people of colour who step out of the supposedly self-evident Canadian mainstream.So, was the Conservative Party talking about, circumcision? What if you want to wear a yarmulkeh? What if you stuff yourself at Bar Mitzvah and wedding buffets (You should have seen them in Winnipeg in 1958, get the elbows out and go for it. OK, I admit it, some of my fellow Judaeo Winnipeggers would get eating barbaric. And no, you can't call the hot line and turn me in for doing it. because I was taught that way!) What if, as a result of your black and white TV childhood, you feel a strong community of identity with Phil Silvers, Jack Benny and Jerry Lewis? What if, on your Vegas junket, you go to see Britney Spears in residency, and haven't a Canadian nationalist thought left after your second, very reasonably-priced margarita?Actually, some of these are Canadian lefty no, no, don't you dares, not just Conservative Party, meany ones.My contention is that, folks like me need to be talking to other Canadians at length. There is not the internal, general knowledge base in Canada that there ought to be. If I have to take a couple of pages to explain that, my Canada isn't the same Canada as your Canada, then I am going to do it.I Don't Get The Young FolksI had to remind a commenter on one of my Answers a few days ago, that describing something is not the same as approving it. What the commenter objected to, was my description of the behaviour I see in young people's club nights on Ottawa weekends. The reason I was describing it, was because, I don't get it, not to provide some totally irrelevant endorsement from some old guy. It can take a few paragraphs to describe what you are clueless about. My dream scenario would be some young, club-loving, young adult Ottawan explaining to me what it is that I am clueless about, and why they are doing what they are doing. They might need a few paragraphs too. However, I take the commenter's point. I will add extra verbiage and a disclaimer, explaining that I have no opinion about what I am describing.So, Tell Me About ItI get the occasional one liner back to the effect of, “That's nonsense”, or “That's ridiculous”. It wouldn't make any difference whether I wrote one line or a hundred lines. They won't like it. If that is all they come up with, after I wrote three pages, I don't care about their opinion.I right all that stuff, so come right back at me. One commenter insisted that I am a weed smoking, week-end cocktail, member of the upper middle class. That is not a rebuttal. (It's also factually wrong. I don't do weed, I don't drink alcohol and, if I was a member of Ottawa's upper middle class, maybe I would be at one of Ottawa's best private golf clubs, writing my Quora content on a high end tablet.) If you don't call me out, then I am going to write my paragraphs.No, I am not writing an encyclopedia, I am writing various views and observations, and making an effort to explain myself.I remember when there were encyclopedia salespeople. They would try to sell you twenty books or so of hard copy, describing all truth for at least a generation. It's gone. Think of the effort of writing a Web encyclopedia, continuously updated. Think of the number of people who would have to be involved.Short Is Not GoodBeing that old, I can recall a time before tweets, photo ops, four word campaign slogans, snappy political one liners and nasty social media ones. And now, I am going to say it, in one short sentence, these things are bad.If anybody wants to bear with me for a paragraph or two, why do I say it is bad? Because it is manipulation, a lot of it is paid for by big time donors, it dodges accountability. (This past week we learned that it took thirty Canadian bureaucrats to write one tweet on behalf of a Cabinet Minister. The tweet was a mess. The federal government has refused to disclose to the Official Opposition who was responsible.)And, a lot of these micro-pronouncements are bullying. They lie. They are wrong. They are an attempt to manipulate. Just think if there was a rule. Want to write a tweet? Then give us a narrative about it. Why did you, or our helpers, write that tweet? What research did you, or your helpers, do before you sent that tweet out?T ell us if you yourself wrote that tweet or whether somebody did it for you? Who are they and what are their qualifications?Yes, it would mean more paragraphs out there, but it would almost be like a truth bath.Am I Verbose?So, explain to me why. No, not a one line insult, but a critique of my vocabulary, my grammar, my spelling. I am listening.Martin LevineWhat is the reason the Canadian government provides generous social welfare for its citizens unlike the US? What motivates it to do so?October 19, 2018The welfare system in Canada isn't that generous. And, there is more than one government involved, not just the federal government of Canada. It is actually the provincial and territorial governments that set most social assistance policies. The municipalities have a substantial role. The level and array of assistance varies from province to province.I should mention that, in Canada, universal medical care, is not welfare. Everyone, from the richest to the poorest, qualifies for it.And, Canada is nothing special. I have lived in Europe, and some of the countries there have social assistance benefits that exceed Canada's. Among the industrial democracies, particularly the wealthier ones, the USA has relatively low levels of social assistance. However, I recognize that it varies from state to state.A Bit of Collectivism in CanadaI have mentioned it in other Answers, the United States Constitution is critical to the ideological system of the country, in a way the constitution isn't for some others. The United States Constitution focuses very strongly on the rights of the individual. I believe that this tends to “tilt” the USA in a conservative direction, because social assistance strategies imply at least a little bit of the assumption of collective responsibility.Canada isn't like that. The country essentially started as a compact between two very distinct linguistic and ethnocultural communities. the French and the British. The French and British communities each acknowledged their members as part of the whole. The members were expected to comply with the religious and cultural norms, and the values of their respective groups. At the same time there was some assumption of group responsibility. Being a British person meant caring about British people everywhere. Originally, French-Canadians were a very homogeneous community, with almost a sense of family.You Will Freeze To Death Here, FastTo a large extent, traditional American cowboy films are about individuals, as per the United States constitution, functioning in the climate and terrain of the Southwest, free to search for life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.Well, why wouldn't you? Except for the mountainous areas, the Southwest has mild winters. It's dry. A cowboy (or an outlaw) could live their life out on the range, with minimal shelter and a limited wardrobe. So, what did they need government assistance for?The same for the Southeast, the same for the Mid-Atlantic states, the same for the Pacific Northwest. You could “sleep rough” as the British put it, even on a winter night, and not be a frozen corpse in the morning.It is not like that in Canada. Most of the country has winters so severe that you will quickly die without proper shelter and clothing. (In much of the country, the temperature can drop to -40, which is the same in Celsius and Fahrenheit, on the chilliest winter nights.) So, what do you do with the people who don't have it? Once November roles around, they will start to freeze to death in the streets. Not providing them with basic shelter and clothing is equivalent of invoking the death penalty.The Depression And The Dust Bowl Taught Canada A LessonThe Dust Bowl extended well into the Canadian Prairies. The Great Depression had already made life there miserable.Canada couldn't have the Depression-era equivalent of the “Oakies”. Canada doesn't have a California. British Columbia at the time had only a very limited amount of urbanization, and the province does not have a lot of agricultural land. The Prairies are separated by a barrier of about 1,500 kilometres of subarctic forest (about a thousand miles) from the Central Canadian provinces of Ontario and Quebec. There was an attempt by dispossessed Prairie People to march to Ottawa to ask for help. It was called the “On to Ottawa Trek”. Wikipedia provides a description:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On...The Trek ended tragically in Regina, Saskatchewan, with a riot and police gunfire. Many Canadians were appalled. As Wikipedia says:“The events helped to discredit Bennett's Conservative government, and in the 1935 federal election, his party went from holding 134 seats to just 39. After the Trek, the Saskatchewan government provided free transportation as a peace sign back to the west. The camps were soon dismantled and replaced by seasonal relief camps run by the provinces, and that paid the men slightly more for their labor than the earlier camps. Although the Trek did not reach Ottawa, its reverberations certainly did. Several demands of the Trekkers were eventually met, and the public support that galvanized behind the Trek set the tone for the social and welfare provisions of the postwar era.”The Trekers were not lazy people. They had fallen into an economic disaster through no fault on their own. Some of them were fellow British people. They convinced a lot of Canadians that moral turpitude wasn't necessary for someone to be in bad need of help.Fabian SocialismThis article from the Canadian Encyclopedia talks about the Canadian version of Fabian socialism. The article is their property. I am providing the link for information purposes:https://www.thecanadianencyclope...Fabian socialism has nothing to do with the Marxian socialism that so many Americans fear. In Canada, to a large extent, it was based on Christian love. It did not preach class hatred. The League For Social Reconstruction created a set of ideas that entered mainstream Canadian life, at the provincial level, but also at the federal one. The Liberal Party of Canada, which has formed many of Canada's federal governments since the 1940's, picked some of the ideas up. At the same time, they assured Canadians that, they would not accept the idea of “real” socialism, that is, the government ownership of the means of production. In fact they successfully marketed an idea to Canada's big business community. A comprehensive “social safety net” would facilitate a docile, cooperative labour force. That labour force would not become interested in real socialism. The big business community could carry on without those worries, and continue, to a large extent, to run Canada the way they pleased.When It Is Not Welfare?Canada subsidizes its post-secondary educational system. The great majority of universities and colleges are public ones, sort of the equivalent of state universities and colleges in the USA. Tuition fees are heavily subsidized. In particular, tuition fees for the community colleges are relatively low.Canadians wouldn't see this as welfare anymore than the public medical care system. (Canada generally prohibits private medical care for citizens and permanent residents.) However, it accomplishes a social objective for Canada that the big business community, again, is at peace with. They get a supply of trained labour. The affordable education means that kids from poorer families still have a chance at a decent education, and moving up. Canadian rates of social mobility are on the high side compared to some other western industrial democracies. It helps to some extent to keep an angry, British-style working class from building up.Canada is not self-sufficient in labour. If it did not permit substantial amounts of immigration, labour shortages would likely grow worse, the population will age, and the population will eventually go into absolute decline.There are already signs of the racialism of poverty in Canada, as immigrants from the developing world take on many of the low-paid jobs. Maybe health care, education, subsidized housing and social assistance will mitigate some of that racialization, and prevent it from becoming multi-generational.So, What Are You Supposed To Do With Them?In a couple of other Answers, I describe an encounter with an employee of the Conservative Party of Canada, in a local gay bar.This gentleman was going on about excessive social benefits to the poor and so on. He was talking to a couple of people who weren't especially educated, and wouldn't have been able to rebut his confidently-asserted arguments.I finally said to the gentleman, “So, what are you going to do with them, gas them?” I pointed out that, in Canada's adult population, there are perhaps 5% to 10% of the population who cannot fully function in the economy. It is a combination of limited cognitive abilities, mental illness, physical disabilities, parents who didn't care about sending them to school, foetal alcohol syndrome and so on. There are also severely-addicted people. One can condemn them for being addicted, but it doesn't matter. Some addictions cannot be cured in some people, even if they are desperately compliant with attempts to help.Given the rough climate we can't let distressed people wander the streets. But there are some other issues too. Canadian crime rates are relatively low, although not as low as one would want. (Gang activity has become a serious problem.) I don't think that the low rates and the comprehensive social safety, health and education net, are unrelated. Make people who otherwise be desperate, much less desperate, and they become a lot more passive. Jailing people is probably the most expensive welfare programme that there is. It doesn't lead to people repenting and becoming socially “better”. Instead they get worse.Some of the other industrial democracies understand that, just as well as Canadians do, Again, we are nothing special.The above isn't an attempt to pass judgement on the USA. There is no reason to demand that the USA go with the group. I have said it before, I don't think a lot of Americans could bear the system that Canada and some of the other industrial democracies have. It is entirely the business of Americans, but, if some Americans are curious about why things are done differently here, it helps to know the whole context.Martin LevineWhy do you lean the way you lean politically?October 17, 2018Originally this was my Answer to the Question, “Why are you politically the way you are?”. which seems to have disappeared from Quora.MartinThis questions partially asks you to see yourself as others see you, and maybe stick some labels on your self. That gets you to thinking.One thing that has struck me, in seeing Quora responses from people of various nationalities, is that a lot of the labels are, of necessity, country specific. A few conservative Americans have described me as a “leftist”. I sure wouldn't make the leftist cut in Canadian political terms.I propose to my American friends:-Can someone with an investment portfolio by a leftist?-Can someone who has several instances of home ownership be a leftist?-Can someone who objects to making being a leftist, a political career, be described as a leftist?-Can someone who believes that a country based on a dominantly private sector economy, with a state-provided social safety net, is best, be a leftist?In Canada, being a leftist requires a fair amount of political heft. Canada has two major political parties that both believe in a capitalist economy. There are some differences about the trappings, one somewhat declaiming its feminism, the other paying some lip service to the traditional family. (As long as Mom goes to work and produces for an employer.)In fact some of the really hot discussions between the Liberal and Conservative Parties of Canada are about administrative competence. One says the other's party leader is sort of a well-meaning fop, there other saying the other party's leader is an idea-less smiley face. This gets me interested.The third party in the Canadian federal government is the New Democratic Party. Now there is some serious leftism for you, nationalization, expanded affirmative action, lots of humanitarian immigration, a principled objection to the USA, the whole works. That is not me.Does Getting Old Make You Conservative?I have heard this argument many times. I have tried to make sure it does not apply to me.I have made a conscious effort not to lose whatever useful idealism I had. However, a lot of what I was idealistic about has come to pass. Canada now has a relatively good social safety net. It is a little bit harder to be openly racist and anti-semitic, although some Canadians still try very hard. You can have sex with another guy without risking going to jail. The various Quebec issues have more or less been resolved. Now that at least some of my youthful political goals have been achieved, I feel a sort of political urge to move on.You Can't Touch ThisBut, as the years pile up, I sort of have a political sinking feeling. There are some important institutions of Canadian society that you can't touch, or, if you try to touch them, your political hand will be firmly slapped away.Canada has the big five chartered banks. It has the Toronto Stock Exchange. It has very powerful real estate developers. It has pension investment funds that want to invest in property. The Canadian constitution allows only the federal governments to charter banks. The success of the big pension funds is essential to viable, safe pensions. (To the extent I thought of old things when I was young, I would certainly have been in favour of that.)And, at this point, I would have to say, forget about things like Senate reforms. The Canadian constitution has some lock-ins that are supported by the Supreme Court of Canada.Despite the wildest-eyed ruminations of a left fringe NDP'er, this isn't going to change. No electable government will touch it. These arrangements are a pillar. Any politics has to work around that pillar and can't confront it. I don't like the argument that, “That's the way it is.”, and I always and still, feel, that for a lot of things that no, that is the way it doesn't have to be and it can be changed, but a head on confrontation with the Big Five and the TSX? No, it can't happen.More generally, I believe that, if you are going to bang your political head, go bang it against something that could, possibly, be changed. You only have so much political head-banging time.Local Me Is Not Federal MeI have a definite political stance. That is, I doubt whether it is possible to have a personal political stance that encompasses all three levels of government. Municipal political me is not federal me. I can easily have a personal political stance about how the Ontario provincial government issues driver licence renewals, that has nothing ideologically in common with federal Liberal policies about Canada's international relations.A Political Canadian Needs a Political Philosophy About AmericaAs if we needed a reminder, the Trump Administration has given it. If you believe a Canadian should have an all around federal political approach, you need to have a, what can we do about America, component.This is another situation where ideology doesn't that much help. It is more like, is the USA like a well-substantiated, UFO sighting? As much as you want to deny it, you know it happened for real, and there is absolutely nothing you can do about them. I don't see a left-right way to approach the United States of America. Even the American progressives don't want to hear a Council of Canadians-type diatribe about social justice. We tried pretending that, if we tell the Americans we really like them, they will be our buddies. No they won't. Instead they think we are up to something devious. It makes them mad.My belief about the best approach to Canada's relations with the USA are, muddle through on a situational basis. And, in the meantime, if we don't diversify our trading relations and stimulate Canada's private business sector (another given), to participate, it is the fault of whatever federal government doesn't, and of the provincial governments too.Process, Really, Really MattersI spent my adult working life with the Government of Canada. My conclusion about being a bureaucrat is, don't trust them. And, they aren't there to create low-cost miracles. A bureaucrat is just as much a career seeker as anyone in the private sector. Government workers are unionized. They won't rate bust. They are individual people looking out for number one.I now believe that, the politics of administration and supervision may be the most important politics of all. This means battering your way towards government accountability and transparency. You need to ask. Have you motivated those bureaucrats? If you have given them dysfunctional software, are those who gave it, going to get disciplined. (I strongly believe that the use of software without a pilot, for any government application, should receive greater scrutiny than issuing a single-source government contract with no tenders.) Also, explain why you made that contract with that bargaining unit? How much did you think about creating incentives for quality work? How did you prioritize merit? Did you consider privatizing that service?. Put all of those answers on one, easily intuitive website, with a provision for comments and questions.My Heart Says Left, Left. My Brain Says, No, No.This is painful. I like to say mildly leftist, progressive things. Yes, it gives me a self-righteous rush. But, what happens when you Mr. Spock yourself, and Mr. Spock says, you are talking irrational nonsense?I feel a liking for collectivist activities, but I can't think of any real reasons to oppose small business. While, as I have said in other Answers, I just can't get into being a house proud property owner, that seriously is a true example of “That's the way it is”.Consequently, I have to agree, street begging, vagrancy and people rambling around in public being drunk, stoned, unruly, or through no fault of their own, psychotic, hurts small business and downtown property values. It is a serious deterrent to convincing families to live downtown and to then shrinking expensive and ecologically damaging suburbs. We have vagrancy laws and laws about being intoxicated in public. Small-time drug dealing is still a criminal offence.Sometimes sympathy and a warm heart don't help. Prosecuting and jailing people who won't comply, helps the law-abiding, even conservative people who really are essential to keeping a nice Canada running. Your compassion points need to be, here is safe, subsidized, supervised housing. Go live there. You have been taken care of. Get off the street. Also, OK, you really want to kick your addiction, we will get you the best therapy you can. But, we have told you for the last time, the law decides what drugs are going to be legal, who can sell them and where you can use them, not you. You are hurting other people when you sell to them. Our commitment is to protect them from you, not to sympathize with your rationalizations and excuses. So, you are going to jail. And, if you don't stop, you will go to jail for a lot longer.And, this is more painful, because I agree with most of the objectives of all but the more extreme Canadian feminists. MeToo has a very valid point that, any woman who has been sexually assaulted or sexually pressured, has a right to, and, in defence of other women, should speak up. However, while I don't at all sympathize with Judge Kavanaugh or any Canadian equivalent, evidence-based law is a large part of what keeps Canada from being a tyranny. Make an allegation but have no verifiable evidence, than you should not be sheltered from the man you have made allegations against, taking legal reprisals.Also, I believe there has to be a balance between the severity of an admitted misbehaviour and what a man who admits to wrongful behaviour does to repent, apologize and change. No man should be able to talk their way around an admitted sexual assault. However, if the issue is disrespectful behaviour, inappropriate language or standing too close, what happens when the man concerned has made a public admission of guilt and an apology to the women concerned, voluntarily gone for counselling and has visibly changed their ways? I believe their culpability stops there, completely. They are somebody who did something wrong and made amends. They cannot be allowed to be a lifelong target. There is no reason to disallow them from any particular type of employment or from being in the presence of women. Any unsubstantiated allegation that they might do it again, or do worse, is slander.Sometimes, Right-Left Or Conservative-Progressive Is IrrelevantMy political experience is, that, some of the most important politics have to deal with how to control your bureaucratic administration, not about your ideology of what you want them to do.I have to concede, sometimes, maybe even regrettably, “That's the way it is.” is true. Your politics about that need to be workarounds, not confrontations.And, I believe that fundamentally, protecting the rule of law is superior to arguments of left-right.I still see myself as a lefty-lib. However, there are large areas of political life where this spectrum does not apply. And, sentimentality and giving in are the enemy of true social progress.Martin LevineWhich version of capitalism is acceptable to left wing people?October 10, 2018“Left Wing People”?This term is more of a hindrance then a help. There is no way to identify a group of people or individuals who can be defined as “left wing”.Part of the reason for this is that there is a basic, very large difference between social democracy and socialism. Socialism advocates for the public (That is, mostly governmental.) ownership of the means of production in a given country.Social democracy doesn't mean that. Social democrats generally believe in a free-enterprise-based economy. What they principally advocate for is “social programmes” that mitigate some of the negative effects of pure free enterprise.We should remember that no country allows a free enterprise system to completely self-regulate. Even relatively conservative countries have business laws. Typically the laws combat monopolies, oligopolies, business fraud, and require licencing for certain types of business, and licences for professions and trades that work in free enterprise establishments. Minimum wages get set. Some types of businesses are not legal at all. And municipal governments can restrict businesses to certain parts of town by means of bylaws. (In the USA, ordinances.)Are there “right wing people”? Someone's right-wingedness (If I can use a nonstandard descriptor.) usually stops at a certain point. Strictly speaking, who has any inherent right to restrict anyone from doing any business they want on the street where you live? How about if you live in Nevada, and someone decides to run a brothel next door? Say they want to build an aluminum smelter or a waste disposal site. What gives you the right to interfere with their freedom?And, say six different power companies want to build their own power transmission systems on your block. Where are they going to fit them all? Why do you have any right to object to your street being dug up?Socialism Shrinks DownDuring the 1960's Canada had a lively socialist movement that wanted to nationalize all kinds of things. This article from Wikipedia describes the now nearly forgotten Waffle Group of the New Democratic Party:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ne...The 1960's were a time to dream. Jobs were plentiful and the different governments were expanding. Young people didn't worry about never being able to pay their student loan debt. You could live in as commune for cheap.There is a good reason why the Waffle Group became a dusty footnote in Canadian political history. As they say in Canadian French, it was “Dreaming in technocolour”. Rather more grounded members of the NDP pointed out that someone owned the stuff the Wafflers wanted to nationalize. A lot of the owners were, in fact, American. Expropriation without compensation would have lead to some serious reprisals, like the American financial community making quite sure that no government in Canada ever had a credit rating again. Or, if the USA happened to have a Trumpesque regime, maybe a knock on the door from the United States Marines. After a while a lot of Canadian socialists weren't so socialistic anymore. Maybe one of the reasons the NDP nowadays tries to market wedge politics, rather than grand economic plans, is because of the reality burnout. They couldn't make free enterprise go away.So, You've Got Capitalism, So What Do You Do With It?Accept that private business is the best way to make your economy produce, then how left can you really be?Canada being the thinly-populated, geographically enormous country it is, Canadians ran into some problems with doing some things on a free enterprise business.If you take Economics 101, whoever is lecturing you (or your software) will tell you you need multiple suppliers, multiple workers, and markets. But, sometimes Canada just didn't have them. Canada started its railway building to the West Coast on a free enterprise basis, albeit with some substantial subsidization and land grants. (That is, land stolen from the indigenous peoples.) It wasn't enough. The Prairies and the mountainous interior of British Columbia didn't have a lot of people or businesses. Canada's first Prime Ministers very definitely were not Marxians. It was government railway, or no railway. It took decades before the Prairies had enough population, farmers and businesses to make the Canadian National Railway able to run on a free enterprise basis.The same for other stuff. The great majority of Canadian hospitals are funded and organized by provincial governments. Surely some extreme Canadian left-wingers nationalized the hospitals of Canada? No. The Canadian economy didn't provide very wealthy charitable donors and the market for hospital services were often dispersed and small. The provincial governments had to step in, because, either Canada would have a system of public hospitals, or not many hospitals at all.The same for other things in Canada. People who go to the emergency ward of a provincial government hospital are not left “left wing”. A base of government-provided services were necessary to make the Canadian free enterprise world run.Left-Right On The MarginsEven in the USA, how many people advocate for no government involvement in anything but national defence or policing? How many farmers are demanding not to receive humiliating subsidies? Where is the mass movement to cancel social security, or even, Medicare?Helping People You Don't LikeEven us lefty Canadians aren't nice all the time. However, what do you do about people who can't, or won't, cut it?Some years ago I was hanging out at my favourite gay bar. That was in the time of the last Conservative federal government. Another chap used to hang out there on a regular basis. He apparently had some job granted to him by the Conservative Party of Canada, and was very proud of it. (Frankly, I think it was probably the best job he ever had.)So, this proud gent was enunciating loudly about people who received social support for things like housing, addictions counselling, and retraining. Of course they mostly had bad heath habits and were putting an inordinate load on our medical care system. Surely they should have been cut off from all of this.OK, I got a little impatient. I finally asked the guy, who had been declaiming loudly to several regulars who didn't seem to have much knowledge about social programming, the government, etc. I said, so what are you going to do, gas them? What did he think the cut-off people were going to do?He didn't seem to have a pre-potted answer for that. I elaborated. There are maybe 5% to 10% of any given population that aren't going to make it. I am not talking about people who are downright lazy. I am talking about the people who are physically and mentally disabled, severely substance-addicted (Yes, they shouldn't be, but they are anyhow.), have dyslexia, were not properly parented, including not enough education but plentiful poverty and family violence.These people can't support yourself. So, my point to my proud Conservative Party employee, was, what happens next? What are they going to do when they are on the street? What if you see giving government grants to homeless shelters as encouraging “indolence”? I doubt my friend knew much about Charles Dickens. He was sort of a self-righteous, contemporary Canadian, politically paid for Scrooge.Tell Me All About It, Right WingI am listening. I don't Waffle. I accept that, of the imaginable systems, free enterprise is the best way to produce a lot of goods and services, and make a country prosperous.But, I might start by asking the supposed right-winger, how do you see my gay bar friend? Do you agree. If you do, you are going to get the same response from me that he did.Presuming the right wing person is not quite so much of an uncaring fantasizer, tell me how, certainly in the context of a free enterprise society, you are going to deal with that five to ten percent. What services would you give them? Where? Who is going to pay for them?My next question is, OK, I believe in the Toronto Stock Exchange. The TSX is supervised by the Government of Ontario. (In Canada, provincial governments are responsible for securities laws.) There are laws against stock fraud and insider trading.Have a look at the TSX. (It's all on the Web.) Do you see it as a socialistic stock exchange? How would you run it differently?The USA has bigger markets then Canada. But, as a right winger, what do you do about situations where there isn't a viable market? (The State of Alaska runs a railroad.) Is your position that, if there is not enough market, it should never happen?I would say to most supposedly right-wingers, the only really hot dispute you can have, in a country that has a free-enterprise based economy, is with Waffle-type socialists. You don't need to convince TSX accepting, social programming positive people, to accept it. It is up to you to answer the questions my Conservative employee guy had no idea about. If you are not as dogmatic as he is, how right are you really?Except for the fringes of the ideological spectrum, the right-left rift is badly overblown. What you are talking about is a whole lot of people who accept the free enterprise model, and are talking about how and who can run it best.Martin LevineWhy don't liberals and conservatives realize that both ideologies have strong and weak points. Isn't there some middle ground people can agree on?October 9, 2018Perhaps this question is a little country specific. Currently, Canada has a bit more of a middle ground than the USA, at least apparently does.Ideology Is One Part Of Politics, And Life In GeneralIdeologies tend to be the most apparent in politics. However, people have ideologies about other spheres of life, maybe not always so conscious. I think that, in their personal lives, people tend to know how their desire to operate according to their views, gets restricted in practise by limited resources and reasonable possibilities.I could take an example that I have mentioned in Answers a few times before. That is, going to live in the suburbs. Living in downtown Ottawa as I do, I tend to see this as a lifestyle choice, sort of an ideology about how to live. However, I have to admit, for a family with kids, I am not sure how great the alternatives are.If I could define suburbanism as an ideology, we start with some principles:-Suburbs offer a wholesome life.-Children should be shielded by certain types of people.-I want to live in a place that is reasonably homogeneous in terms of social class.-I want a drivable environment. I am not that concerned about a walkable one.-I want a very quite residential environment. I do not want businesses, public offices, shelters, etc., on my street.And then, some political ideology grows out of that:-Yes, suburbs are expensive to operate. However, we are raising society's next generation. We deserve to be subsidized.-Yes, cars produce pollutants and greenhouse gases. However, our needs must be accommodated.-We have no responsibility to accommodate the poor and different people in our own community.-Municipal governments have a strong responsibility to control land use very tightly.This may sound a little cruel. However, I am not suggesting that most suburbanites despise the poor and alternative lifestyle people. Nor are they necessarily indifferent to the environment. (What if gasoline vehicles are were phased out for all-electric ones. How many suburbanites would be outraged?) Nor are they saying that their shouldn't be various businesses and activities near them. They just prefer it to be at a drive-to location, not on their residential streets. But, it is still an ideology.Ideologies Grow From People OutOf course, even in a democracy, there are the ideological “forcers”. There are politicians, news media, business groups, community organizations that would prefer you do not doing your own thinking.In a totalitarian state, one had better express acceptance of the official line, or else. Karl Marx essentially tried to define all of human life in terms of economic and class relationships in any given country.I don't believe this is right. People have a sense of themselves that goes far beyond their class position in society. Ideology, at the personal life level and the political level, tends to start with other things, such as:-I am an Albertan.-I am a member of a given ethnicity.-I have a given lifestyle that I need to pursue.-I feel my way of life is threatened.-I'm a woman.When identity gets translated into politics, it grows out of how people prioritize themselves. If the “official” ideologies tend to focus on why people are rich or poor, or about the redistribution or non-redistribution of income, that doesn't mean, that this is what any individual is thinking about when they get up in the morning, or necessarily so much cares about.How much of ideology is based on altruism? Maybe not so much. Much of the time, people are bundling up their feelings about what is good for them, and are looking for an agreeable ideology.The Ideological MarketNot all that many people have the time, or the volition, to make up a political ideology, as opposed to a maybe not recognized ideology about how they, personally, want to live. In a country with reasonable freedom of speech, political ideologies are a market item. Like anything else on the market, they get oversold. Some of the ideological products are flawed, or, in terms of implementability, useless. Some of them have been created to serve particular groups in a country, but it isn't meant to be obvious.An element of marketing of a given political ideology, is sometimes, that people who don't believe in it are bad. They are the other. And so, they are against our country. This makes an ideology into a dangerous product. Just think if ideological products had to meet the type of marketing standards that governments require for cars or software.Big markets produce big marketing. That goes for marketing political ideologies. I think that high-powered, mass marketing of ideologies, to the huge American audience (Who might donate to your cause, or vote for it, so you can win big.) is more the primary cause of ideologies running to extremes in the USA, than any of the substantive issues. In Canada we are lucky because we have to run political advertising on the relative cheap. Canada's total population is less than that of California, and divided into two different language markets.Who Am I, And What's In It For Me?When political ideologies get marketed on full blast, people can get distracted from what they want for themselves. I think left and right stand to come together, by asking, what's in it for me. What if Americans were not deterred from, enunciating as a starting point, these examples:-I am old, male and Caucasian.-I am female, educated and very angry. Men don't get what we want and I am tired.-I am a Native American.-I am a dentist.-I live in a run-down neighbourhood in a Rust Belt city, and I don't have the resources to move.This isn't wedge politics. It is a statement that, ideologies have to answer what people feel they really are, not what they are told they are.In effect, while I kind of hate to say it, ask not what I can do for my country, ask what my country can do for me.When you start asking defining yourself like the above, you can lose the ideological salespeople. Also, you can ask whether an ideology is what you need.How Much Is This Going To Cost?In the British (That is, Canadian) parliamentary system, losing a vote on a money bill will bring the government down. The system developed that way for really good reasons. The government of the day has to explain what something is going to cost, and why. They need to explain where the money is going to come from.That government is highly likely to be asked, where was that in your electoral platform? More precisely, the Prime Minister will get asked directly, because he is a Member of Parliament and has to face a Question Period. The Cabinet Ministers are M.P.'s too. They are going to get questioned. They can't make do with hollering out a soundbite to the media. They can't answer by hollering out slogans at a party rally.The Canadian system is far off being perfect, but it can defeat ridiculous ideological statements when the head of the Administration and their Cabinet can't dodge questions.There is a general rule that can serve one well when they are confronted with aggressive political statements. That is, where is the money?When Is Ideology A Shell Game?The problem is a focus on ideologies, and demanding that people define themselves against them. Ideologies are meant to be an end product, not what someone with a vivid imagination wants to sell you on.I am not at all sure that left-right ideologies are even necessary for politics. Politicians need to be saying, I understand how you see yourself, and this is what I can do about it.I have said it before in other Answers. Any government is mostly administration, not principles. I am not sure you can build a left-right culture around good government. Good government is about transparency, accountability, gathering facts, judging the available resources, keeping corruption out, and defeating civil service careerism that is so self-centred, that it comes before doing an adequate job.In reality, in any democratic society, ideology is only a general set of principles. You do not need an ideology that covers everything.Ideological shell games happen in Canada, but in the USA, big media and big money are making things worse.Just imagine if there was a movement in the USA to challenge the ideologies that are on the market, all of them. It is kind of like a parliamentary budget exercise. Justify this ideology. What does it do for people, who are allowed to identify themselves? Can it be used to generate concrete policies, is your bureaucracy up to implementing it (and, maybe your data infrastructure), and just how much is it going to cost?Martin LevineHow does culture influence the economic development?October 5, 2018This is a very broad question that can be interpreted in various ways. There isn't a standard, common definition of what a “culture” is. As I have said in other Answers, I don't think it can be assumed, at all, that one country has one culture. (I have explained why that wouldn't be possible in Canada.)The Merriam-Webster dictionary offers these alternative definitions of culture at:https://www.merriam-webster.com/...Of course these definitions are their property. I am quoting them for information purposes only.1 a: the customary beliefs, social forms, and material traits of a racial, religious, or social groupalso : the characteristic features of everyday existence (such as diversions or a way of life) shared by people in a place or timepopular cultureSouthern cultureb : the set of shared attitudes, values, goals, and practices that characterizes an institution or organizationa corporate culture focused on the bottom linec : the set of values, conventions, or social practices associated with a particular field, activity, or societal characteristicd : the integrated pattern of human knowledge, belief, and behavior that depends upon the capacity for learning and transmitting knowledge to succeeding generations2a : enlightenment and excellence of taste acquired by intellectual and aesthetic trainingb : acquaintance with and taste in fine arts, humanities, and broad aspects of science as distinguished from vocational and technical skillsI was going to say that definition 2(a) and (b) probably isn't too relevant to this Question, but, upon reflection, I am not so sure.“Development” can mean various sorts of things. So that I can provide something approaching a meaningful answer, I will focus mostly on economic development, as the question requests.My own views are strongly effected by circumstances in my personal life:-A Master's Degree with a focus on history and sociology-Having travelled to various places as a result of being a Canadian foreign service officer most of my life.-Being Jewish, so a member of an ethnic group that gets accused a lot of being crass, money-obsessed and materialistic.What Did The Ideological World Teach Me About Culture and Development?When I was young I heard left and right wing arguments, a lot.At the risk of oversimplifying:-Left. Underdevelopment is the result of abusive social classes at the top of society cruelly manipulating and impoverishing the peasants and working classes of a country. It is even worse when that country was conquered and colonized. And, neo-colonialism carries on.-Right. Underdevelopment is the result of certain cultures teaching people to be lazy, to rely on welfare and to try to scam the system, rather than teaching them to work hard and take responsibility for themselves. (I am not including arguments about racial inferiority, because that is a type of extremism and an assertion, not a conservative argument. I don't see most conservatives as racist.)When I was in graduate school, I had to read the works of Gunnar Myrdal, a Swedish economist and sociologist. Among other achievements he wrote about the sociology and economics of the developing world. He proposed the idea of a “soft state”. This is a complex concept, but it was basically about governments that did not have the respect and trust of their own populations, and who were not seen by the population as legitimate. These states have great difficulty in organizing society. They have incompetent and corrupt bureaucracies.I have heard it proposed that the Bismarckian German state was the polar opposite, a government that was highly respected and trusted by its population, where there was a lot of voluntary compliance with government laws and rules.Then, I lived in India, Great Britain, the Philippines and Austria, and spent time on temporary duty in places like Germany, Ghana, Romania, Singapore and Russia. This was an excellent way to test the left and right explanations about why places stay underdeveloped and consider what Gunnar Myrdal had to say.No, It Is Not Just Colonial OppressionIndia, the Philippines, Ghana and Singapore were all colonies. Singapore certainly bounced back. It is very prosperous and the working classes are accommodated with subsidized housing and health care. Because Singapore is a city state, it doesn't have peasants.It Is Really, Really Hot HereNot working hard, or not getting paid fairly is not just about neo-colonial oppression, or having a bad attitude towards a hard day of work.All these four countries are very hot. It can get to 50 C. (122 F.) in New Delhi in the north Indian summer. You can't do anything unless you are in an air-conditioned place. Southern India, the Philippines, Ghana and Singapore don't get such high absolute temperatures, but they can be extremely humid. The sunshine is so strong that it is a health risk. Unless you are in an air-conditioned place, you will not produce work the way you would on a brisk day in Canada.Parts of Ghana and India suffer from extreme droughts. There aren't any glacier fed river basins, except in the north of India, where the water is overutilized.And, if your country doesn't have resources, people stand a good chance of staying poor. None of the four countries is well-fixed. However, Singapore has a resource of a kind, its geographic position at the very centre of one of the world's greatest trading routes, with spacious, safe harbours, outside of the typhoon belts, and with little in the way of earthquakes.Then, there is a reality of tropical countries where nomadic life ended and farming began thousands of years ago. They have had time to build up huge, subsistence-level populations. By contrast, northern North America and Australia had indigenous populations that were largely hunters and gatherers, a lifestyle that can only support a thin population.So, it is not all culture and ideology. What does your culture mean to your prosperity, when you are a peasant in a hugely-crowded country, with a population of more than one billion?Your Culture Doesn't Normally Teach You A Laziness PackageBeing a social parasite is not a culturally-endorsed value in India, the Philippines or Ghana. Most of the people I met there understood the concept of working for a living. There are rip-offf artists and people who would tell any sort of lie or run any sort of scam to avoid a day of hard work. However, there are a fair number of people like that in the developed world too.Indian and Filipino culture both teach some values that almost any people would see as commendable, caring about your family and friends, being a good member of your community, being honest.But, while I respect both cultures a lot, I believe there is a cultural problem. Hinduism and Roman Catholicism teach some very good values, but, not the high value of limiting your family size, or leaving the city or farm where your family is to get a good job. I wouldn't say that either religion is hostile to commerce, but they don't emphasize it.And, no, I don't believe that the ruling elites and the neo-colonial intruders have packaged up those religions that way, to keep the masses in their place. These are religious ideologies that long, long, predate the technological era or European colonial aggression.You Are A Work Unit First, A Human Being LaterThe Industrial Revolution, and what came after, preached a message that people don't like to acknowledge. You are a unit of work, before you are a person. Your kids will be trained to be units of work. It doesn't at all matter what you would like your family life to be like. It doesn't matter that it is painful to wait at a bus stop when it is -30 C. And, if there is a good job that happens to be 2,000 Km from Mom and Dad, then, as the British sometimes like to say, on your bike. If the people at work don't come from your culture and religion, that's too bad. And, if your culture teaches you that it is wrong for a woman to give a man orders, forget your culture.As workers in the Industrialized world stopped being so dirt poor (at least some of them) and as the middle class grew, there was another cultural change. OK, you are a unit of work, you are getting some pay, so now you are a consumer. Making buying choices is going to be a big, big part of your life.So, the “corporate culture focused on the bottom line”, beat “the customary beliefs, social forms, and material traits of a racial, religious, or social group”.I am not sure what else you can do to be developed. The Soviet Union tried to replace the culture sponsored by the Russian Orthodox Church by a sort of altruistic, made up, quasi religion. It didn't work. Then the elite got very cynical and decided they were going to live high anyhow.A Kind Of Nasty Culture Has WonNot that many people in the developed world want to talk about it, but there is a tacitly accepted set of values that produces development, presuming there is a climatic and demographic chance to develop anything.-I'm in it for me and mine.-Look out for number one.-Market yourself.-It is all about competition.-The job first, the rest of me after.-I like to shop.A Word For My Own Group, And About MitigationNo, I am not a crass money-grubber and neither are most Jews.But, I have to say, the religion that drives whatever Jewish culture there is (There is more than one.), had to adjust to exist. At one time Jews saw themselves as sons and daughters of the soil. The Romans shut it down. Jews were forced into places where they weren't allowed to farm or work in the trades. There had to be a religious adjustment or there wasn't going to be a religion.So, Judaism has spent a couple of thousand years wrapping a morality around a rough reality. Basically, OK, do business, but do not be vicious. Practise ample charity. Cheating anybody is not OK. Donate to community infrastructure or there is not going to be anything left of us. Don't break any laws unless those laws are out to break you because you are a Jew.So, it is not the job first, the rest of me after. You don't just look out for number one. However, working to make money, marketing yourself without lying, competing without back-stabbing, shopping, it is OK. If you need to move for work, just make sure to join a synagogue as soon as you get there.Essentially, this was an early start on what the social welfare state is. Some of the developed countries have decent social safety nets. But, even in Sweden, people market themselves, move to a job, compete and go shopping.There are a few very resource rich states where citizens can get a salary from the government, and don't have to make a living. I am not denying that elites exist, and have power, or that neo-colonialism doesn't happen. I am not commending the work unit-consumer culture. But, I just don't know of any other culture that has a chance of creating a developed country, where most of the people are in the economic game.Martin LevineWhat advice would you give to people who are confused about their political ideology?September 18, 2018My primary advice, is, ask yourself, why do I need a political ideology?As I often do, I will start with a definition of ideology, in this case from the Merriam-Webster dictionary. It is their property and I am quoting it for information purposes only:https://www.merriam-webster.com/...a: a manner or the content of thinking characteristic of an individual, group, or cultureb : the integrated assertions, theories and aims that constitute a sociopolitical programc : a systematic body of concepts especially about human life or culture2 : visionary theorizingMerriam-Webster also gives us a definition of “political” at:https://www.merriam-webster.com/...a: of or relating to government, a government, or the conduct of governmentb : of, relating to, or concerned with the making as distinguished from the administration of governmental policy2 : of, relating to, involving, or involved in politics and especially party politics3 : organized in governmental termspolitical units4 : involving or charged or concerned with acts against a government or a political systemYou can live your life without any of the above. If I wanted to have an ideology, I would first ask myself, what do I need one for? I only have a certain number of minutes to do anything during my waking day. How much time can I afford to spend thinking about politics, or developing an ideology about politics? Do I need integrated assertions? Do I need a systematic body of concepts?There is also an issue that comes from what one means by “government”? Much of the time an individual who is thinking about politics has several different levels to think about, in a federal state, (like the USA, Canada, Australia and some others.) the federal level, the state or provincial one, and then municipal, such as city, town, village, county, parish, etc. You can be very interested in politics but can have different ideologies for each different level. There is nothing wrong with this, and if you try to develop one unitary ideology, you can stumble.I should try to put a limit on what I mean by “ideological principles”. So, say you live in a country where the constitution or other basic law (such as the common law) define some basic rules about how an individual's political life is going to operate, such as freedom of speech, freedom of association, freedom to move where you please, a free press, freedom from arbitrary imprisonment, etc. If, as far as you can tell, most of the population of your country accepts these principles, then they aren't necessarily an ideology, they are the framework around how you can build and express your political ideology.I would suggest that, if you define ideology as something relating to government, it is very hard to have a political ideology applicable to countries other than your own. Every country has a different history, different circumstances, and contains different cultures. Evidently, you can have a political ideology that includes your own country's foreign relations. But, trying to develop a meaningful ideology about politics in another country, unless you have spent a lot of time living there too, takes an awful lot of research.What If You Already Have An Ideology But You Are Not Sure How Good It Is?This Question seems to apply this is the questioner's situation. I can suggest a technique to get to the bottom of things. That is, put aside that ideology for a little while, and rebuild from the start. Presumably you want to build an ideology that is realistic and implementable. Here are some things you can do to implement a “realistic and implementable” test.What's In It For Me?I wouldn't want to live in a country where that's all anybody thought about, but, if you are capable of thinking, it makes sense to think about your own interests, while committing to not just stopping there. What do you want from each level of government you have to deal with? How would you like that government to go about giving it to you?“Me” can extend to “we”, but can you identify a group that represents your interests? This can make you ask a painful question about how you see yourself, as an individual in your country, but you really should ask it. You should also consider that, legitimately, you can belong in several different groups in society, at the same time. Each of those groups can have contradictory interests. Since it is very difficult to achieve any political goal in your own, do you need to prioritize the groups you feel you belong to, by ranking your own interests? Something may have to give.What's In It For Everybody?Your country has some sort of everybody, meaning everybody physically in it or only temporarily absent from it.However, setting some of your political ideologies may involve setting a screen on who you think the national everybody is. Do you mean, only people born in your country who have citizenship in your country, plus naturalized citizens? Do you want to exclude legal temporary residents or illegal residents? Are there other groups in your country, who meet the citizenship standards, but who you see as being worthy of exclusion from your country's identity? (In Canada, unfortunately, there was a very long debate about whether indigenous people ought to be considered as full Canadians, with an entitlement to permit in the general political process.)If you want to be altruistic, you will focus better, if you consider just whose needs and views, deserve to be added into the mix that creates the political issues that exist in your country. Your ideology may include the assertion that some groups do not deserve any benefits from your country, have no right to have input, and don't need to be considered.Your FactsThere are fake facts out there. No doubt about it. But some facts aren't that hard to verify. There are a lot of statistics, a lot of historic sources, that can add to your confidence that something or some event is real. If you are asserting that no facts are confirmable, than how can you have an ideology? If you see something on the Internet or in print, you might want to ask yourself, how verifiable is this information, how likely is it, and what are the credentials of the originator?Things Take Resources and TimeA political ideology isn't very complete or useful, unless it gives the person who wants one, some definite ideas about, what actions, different levels of government should, or shouldn't, take.But, there is a starting point, what can a given government be expected to do, in a given period of time?Unless you are talking about dictatorships, governments are generally very hemmed in, in the actions they can take:-There are laws and maybe a constitution. If you want to have something resembling legitimate government actions, the government has to work within the legal framework it took office with.One of the principal actions that governments take, is to decide whether they need to create new laws, amend some existing ones or cancel them altogether. A given government may have to decide whether it has the authority to legislate on some matter, or maybe refer the jurisdiction issue to the country's Supreme Court. Governments have to rely on a lot of expertise to do any of this, and yet more expertise to draft or amend new laws. One would hope that the government concerned would do some consultations, or maybe the existing laws require them. This is slow. Amending a constitution is that much slower. All the experts, policy analysts, statisticians, lawyers, communications staff, consultations, hearings, the legislative drafters, cost the taxpayer money, sometimes an awful lot of it.-Budgets are budgets. Governments aren't governments unless they raise money and prioritize how they spend it. Anyone who is concerned about the political actions of a given level of government should watch that bottom line. How much would a new social programme cost, how much would an aircraft carrier, how much would a border defence wall? In your opinion, who ought to pay for it? (For example, individual taxpayers, corporate ones, user fees?) In democratic countries, governments have to put out a lot of information about their budgets. If they are refusing to do it, why? What if the money just isn't there?-Who is going to make up the actions and do them? Governments sometimes pretend they are completely corporate, that is, it is the government that is somehow making decisions and taking actions, without any individual being responsible. That is convenient, but it isn't at all true. The buck stops somewhere. Someone in authority has to sign the memo or order, that tells the government apparatus to do something. If the government in question isn't saying who that was, that is a really bad sign.Before you work on a political ideology that will cause a government to do certain actions, it is a really good idea to ask yourself, who is going to take responsibility for deciding on a given action, and are they are competent to do it? There isn't any point in advocating for an ideology, if the government you want to do something, hasn't the competence to make adequate decisions on what actions to take.Do You Need An Ideology About How A Government Can Carry Out An Ideology?I think so. Before you rush to build up your ideology about what actions governments ought to take, it is good to have an ideology about how governments carry out actions, how they ought to cost them out and pay for them, what information they should be required to release, how they consult, how they choose who decides on and authorizes certain actions, and how they determine whether those persons are performing adequately and what to do if they don't.In other words, your political ideology might best start with some ideas about the role of a Public Service Commission, about how political appointments gets justified, about how budgetary information gets released to the public, about who gets to be consulted, about how the public learns about who determined whether a government had sufficient resources and competency to take an action, about how to learn about who made the actual decisions, and about how to learn whether they go sanctioned for making mistakes, and about who took action to remedy them? In other words, process matters a lot. If you don't have an adequate process, no matter what you want to happen, you won't get adequate actions.Take Your TimeWhen you talk about your political ideology, what level of government are you most concerned about? Maybe it is totally legitimate to first work on your ideology about what your municipal government ought to do. It may be counterproductive to work on your ideology for all the levels at the same time.You may need time to check whether what you thought were facts, really seem likely to be facts. You may need to take some time about which group identities you think you belong in, and which identity is most important.You may need a fair amount of time to develop your ideology about how a government can carry out an ideology.It may be a legitimate conclusion that you don't need an integrated, systematic ideology at all, or can't get enough information to have one.And, What Do You Want That Political Ideology For?Politics can only take an individual so far. They aren't a good way for an individual to find meaning in life, enjoyment, fun, friendships or relationships. Compared to anybody's whole life, political ideologies only have so much use. It is a really good idea to try very hard to screen out these motivations from any political ideology you want to have.Rather, I suggest, if you feel confused, do the exercise above, compare it against whatever ideologies you had before, don't even think about whether you were wrong, see what you feel you can keep from your old ideologies, not be emotional about what you feel you have to lose, and always, think about whether there are things governments can't, or shouldn't, do, at all.Martin LevineWhy is Canada so reluctant to drop their tariff on American dairy products? Is the dairy industry really that important to Canada?September 11, 2018Canada does not have tariffs on all American dairy products. Under NAFTA, the United States negotiators freely agreed to an arrangement, where a certain amount of dairy products could be traded between Canada and the USA duty free. Currently, the USA exports about five times as much milk to Canada as Canada does to the USA. The Canadian tariff only applies to American milk exports that are over the mutually agreed quota.The USA could already be availing itself of more dairy exports to Canada, if it hadn't dropped out of the arrangements for the Trans-Pacific Partnership. The Government of Canada had already agreed to concede more space for dairy imports from the participating countries.Is The Dairy Industry Really That Important To Canada?Of course it is very important. How would Americans feel if all milk, cheese, sour cream, ice cream and yogourt disappeared from store shelves everywhere? Canada isn't any different.Canada's dairy industry is technologically intensive and requires only limited amounts of labour. There number of dairy farmers isn't very large. However, the dairy farmers are respected, especially in the Province of Quebec, which contains a large part of Canada's dairy industry.An implied contention of the Trump Administration is that Canada's dairy farmers are meaningless foreigners. No, they aren't:https://www.dairyfarmers.ca/Canada's dairy farmers are the sort of rural people that so many Americans, particularly the conservative ones, insist are part of the “soul” of America. Why should Canadians think differently?Concerning the general size and importance of Canada's dairy industry, Wikipedia is informative:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Da...“Dairy farming is one of the largest agricultural sectors in Canada. Dairy has a significant presence in all of the provinces and is one of the top two agricultural commodities in seven out of ten provinces.In 2017, there were 945,000 dairy cows on 10,951 farms across the country. Quebec and Ontario are the major dairy producing provinces, with 49% and 33% of the farms as well as 37% and 33% of the milk production being present in these provinces, respectively. This is supposed to represent 8% of farmers in Canada. While dairy farming is still prominent in Canadian society, the number of dairy farms in Canada has been dropping significantly since 1971 while the size of the average farm has significantly increased.The Canadian dairy sector contributes approximately $18.9B yearly to Canada's GDP, and sustains approximately 215,000 full-time equivalent jobs. On average, two-thirds of Canadian dairy produced is sold as raw milk while the remaining one-third is refined into other dairy products such as milk, cheese and butter.”Canada's population and economy is about one tenth the size of that of the USA. The 215,000 full-time equivalent jobs that Wikipedia refers to would be the equivalent of 2,150,000 in the USA. So, yes, the dairy industry is really that important to Canada.Stop Whining And Stop AccusingGreat nations are not meant to whine. The Trump Administration is whining.The current NAFTA trading arrangements between Canada and the USA are not the result of some sort of Canadian trickery. They are not Canada exploiting the USA. The American NAFTA negotiators knew exactly what they were getting into. There wasn't any Canadian sleight of hand. Canada was protecting its own dairy industry, not exploiting the USA.The term “free trade agreement” is misleading. People confuse it with “economic union”, a sort of European Union-type situation. Free trade agreements probably should be more accurately called, managed trade agreements. These agreements don't attempt to include all types of trade between countries. Legitimately, certain types of trade get excluded. NAFTA does not include some other types of trade as well. It does not include softwood lumber. It does not include the cultural industries. Canada never agreed to provide an economic union with the USA. The USA did not want it. Given the prevalence of American nationalism, it is very unlikely that the USA would ever agree to an economic union. The USA made a choice to consider free trade only. It negotiated and agreed to a deal.Consider what would have happened, if, instead of Donald Trump flinging lies and insults, the American negotiators were pressing for somewhat higher milk quotas, before the tariffs kick in. If other aspects of the negotiations were going adequately, Canada would very likely have agreed.Manage Your Own Dairy IndustryThe United States Government heavily subsidizes dairy farmers. This means that there is no free enterprise market in dairy products in the USA. Instead, the result is overproduction, at the same time that some American farmers are going bankrupt.This is a American issue. The Trump Administration's partial solution is to use Canada as a milk dump. No country is going to agree to that. When the USA takes that approach, it contributes to destroying its credibility as a trade negotiator with Canada, while that credibility is already severely compromised.We Did It And Do It Our WayCanada is a foreign country and does foreign things. Canada has no obligation to do things the American way.The Wikipedia article briefly describes agricultural supply management in Canada:“The government of Canada put in place a supply management system during the early 1970's, as an effort to reduce the surplus in production that had become common in the 1950s and 1960s, and to ""ensure"" a fair return for farmers.Supply management is a shared jurisdiction between the Federal and Provincial governments. For example, on a Canada-wide basis, there is the Canada-wide Canadian Dairy Commission, composed mostly of dairy farmers, while in Ontario there is the Dairy Farmers of Ontario. Other provinces also have similar local boards.In 1983, the National Milk Marketing Plan came into effect to control supply, setting guidelines for calculating Market Sharing Quota. This agreement is between the federal and provincial powers. The Milk Marketing Plan was created to replace the Comprehensive Milk Marketing Agreement, which was initially established in 1971. By 1983, every province except Newfoundland had signed onto the Milk Marketing Agreement. Following dairy, a national supply management system was implemented for eggs in 1972, turkey in 1974, chicken in 1978 and chicken hatching eggs in 1986.The basic idea behind supply management is to manage production so that supply is in balance with demand, and the farm gate price enables farmers to cover their costs of production, including a return on labour and capital.”The current American Administration has made itself a critic of the Canadian supply management system. The United States has no entitlement to critique the internal workings of foreign governments, except if those workings are in support of an attack on the USA. The supply management system took years for the federal and provincial governments of Canada to put in place. It long predates NAFTA, or even the earlier Canada-US Free Trade Agreement.Consider if, Canada and the USA agreed that the governments in the two countries ought to critique the internal arrangements of each other. Since supply management in Canada includes the provincial governments, the agreement would extend down to the subfederal level.So, the Government of Canada conducts an audit of the American social security system (With the agreement that the social security system must open its books to the auditors who have just arrived in Washington from Ottawa) Or, the Government of Manitoba has agreed to undertake a review of the California water supply system. Or, the New Mexico State Government does its own assessment of highways management in the Province of Prince Edward Island. If you think about it neutrally, there is actually a case to be made. It would sort of be a mutual peer review, and could lead to useful suggestions. Would even a Bernie Sanders supporter agree to this type of thing?The implicit Trump contention is that, Canada is not a “real” country, but more sort of a chilly, less-distressed Puerto Rico, and that the USA has a right to supervise Canadian affairs. That is much more of a problem than how many litres of milk are shipped across the New York State-Ontario border.Who Are You Trying to Kid?If the implicit argument is that Canada is sort of a Commonwealth of the USA, then, presumably Canadians ought to involve themselves in American internal affairs. However, say for the sake of argument, that Canadians really are bona fide foreigners. Here the Canadians are, strung out not very far from the American border, and up close and personal with the USA. So, what do we see:-An American President, teetering on the edge of impeachment, and shivering in fear of Chapter 25.-In the mean time, his White House staff are censoring his decisions.-Republican members of Congress who are, in all fairness, cowards and opportunists.-An impressive morass of American legal problems about whether Donald Trump has any authority to negotiate a bilateral agreement with Mexico, cancel the NAFTA agreement, implement tariffs, not accept that the cancellation of NAFTA will lead to the revival of the previous Canada-US Free Trade Agreement, or whether Donald Trump has any authority to negotiate any bilateral agreement with Canada.-So many Americans who proudly proclaim their ignorance of other countries, because they are not important, and because the USA is so exceptional.-The same Americans getting excised, because the same unimportant countries are really exploiting the USA, very badly.-Fox “News”-Larry Kudlow and Jared Kushner.Being a foreigner does not necessarily make you a fool. We see what Americans ought to admit. The Trump Administration's declamations about unfair dairy trade with Canada, are 99% symptoms of internal problems in the USA, and 1% about America's foreign trade. The substantive, realistic issue, is whether Canada will expand the duty free sector of Canadian-American dairy trade somewhat. Also, there is an issue about Class 7 milk. The following article is from iPolitics. It is their property. I am providing the link for information purposes only:https://ipolitics.ca/2017/04/22/...Complex yes? Does it require the attention of expert negotiators, yes. Does it affect more than just a very small amount of total trade between Canada and the USA, no.The United States Administration has made an issue about the USA's dairy trade with Canada, but it not at all justified, because:-This is a small proportion of the total trade between the two countries.-The United States Government freely agreed to the current arrangements, when NAFTA was negotiated. They were not tricked.-Several years ago, Canada offered some concessions.-Canadian farmers are actually real people, just like American ones.-The United States government has no entitlement to critique internal economic systems set up by the Governments of Canada and the Canadian provinces.-They certainly wouldn't agree that, all the Canadian governments involved with Canadian dairy production, should critique the Government of the USA and the state governments.-The so called dispute has more to do with a bombastic, aged, unqualified, and now frightened, person, trying to function as the President of the United States.-Those who choose to remain ignorant about Canada have no business talking about Canada, or to Canadians.-The internal United States legal system regarding who can make international trade agreements, and how, is in a mess.Martin LevineDo Canada and the United States have a common culture, economy, and heritage?September 3, 2018I am tempted to say, no, no, no! But this is in part because President Trump was being especially aggravating last week. I could intellectualize my personal irritation a little bit, and ask, is the current President symptomatic of America's culture, economics and heritage? Personally, I think, yes, he is. President Trump did not invent negative attention seeking and pseudo-paranoia as part of America's political culture. It has been around for a long-time.By contrast, English-speaking Canada has a pronounced culture of socio-niceness. I believe that, in some sort of way, Donald Trump understands this and really does hate it. So do a fair number of authentic Republicans, plus those of his base who are able and willing to perceive different countries. They have already answered this Question in a certain way. They are also saying, no, no and no!French, French And Just As French As You Can BeI have said it before, in response to various other Questions, to the point of Canada being just the same as the USA, a part that somehow, illegitimately, got detached, so let's annex it. Quebec is no part of the USA and never was. They don't speak the same language there. Their culture heritage and legacy is very strict, very Papal-supreme, Roman Catholicism. It is almost more helpful for an American to think, “prosperous version of Mexico, with lots of icicles”. You can't erase Quebec. All these questions are about English-speaking Canada, which is not a country and only a very fuzzy version of a traditional nation.Fair DinkumI would ask American readers to apply a test of Canada. An American might usefully evaluate Canada, and its culture, economy and heritage, on a continuum. But, let's apply a checkpoint:https://www.google.ca/maps/@-38.106915,145.2798091,3a,75y,11.78h,83.98t/data=!3m7!1e1!3m5!1s2-Gnzpt93vEBfda-cuVXGw!2e0!6s%2F%2Fgeo3.ggpht.com%2Fcbk%3Fpanoid%3D2-Gnzpt93vEBfda-cuVXGw%26output%3Dthumbnail%26cb_client%3Dmaps_sv.tactile.gps%26thumb%3D2%26w%3DI am not sure whether this lengthy address in Google Streetview will work in a Quora article. I will give the search terms in just a second. But, I want to point out:Look at this pleasant residential street. Does it not elegantly speak to the best of America's culture, economy and heritage? Aren't these, single, detached bungalows attractive? Look at those well-paved, nice and straight sidewalks, with dropped curves at every intersection. These are house-proud people. Someone has been diligently cutting the grass and maintaining the flower beds. So, where is this exemplary street in suburban America? Here are the Google Streetview search terms. It's a shocker:“66 Cochrane St., Cranbourne, State of Victoria, Australia”The suburban USA exemplified, in a southern hemisphere Twilight Zone!And, just to accentuate:https://www.google.ca/maps/@-45....“27 Wilson Ave, Dunedin, Otago, New Zealand”.So, where are the cultural, economic and heritage bits that make these far-away streets, what any Trumpian would say they are, profoundly alien, profoundly foreign, profoundly abusive and disrespectful us, profoundly wrong and profoundly threatening?It's Not About Us And You, It's About The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern IrelandThe assumption is that Canada and the USA are two peas, one little, one big, in the same pod. But, the whole pea patch originates from someplace else, London, England, and nearby. More Streetview visualization:https://www.google.ca/maps/@53.5...“26 Sunbury Drive, Southport, England”.Nice, straight sidewalks, gardens, recycling bins on the curb (The Southporters would call it a “kerb”.) Two cars to a household.British culture and British ideas about economic life, including the economic lives of individuals and their families, are really, really powerful. They have shaped the residential streets and lives of not just Britain, but Canada, the USA, Australia and New Zealand. Streetview yourself to various other worldwide places and you will see determined attempts to emulate it. Maybe I shouldn't have said, “continuum”. It is more like a matrix, with Buckingham Palace as a key reference point. The USA does it over a bigger land mass, but think about that transplantable street scene in the suburbs of Melbourne.The American Constitution, Deconstruct Britishness Into Political Elements, And Keep MostWhat happens when political ideas bump into ethnicity? One example is the United States Constitution.I have said in other Answers, the United States Constitution was a profound attempt to create a country based on ideas. But, pre-revolutionary America was British. The Constitution didn't cancel out most of that. Rather, it endorsed and codified it. Here are British-based ideas that the Constitution did not throw on the ash-heap of North American history:-Speak English. Write in it. Read English literature. Consume English-language cultural content.-A man's (or nowadays, a person's) home, is his castle. (So, cut your grass.)-The common law, and its precedents, are the way we are going to go.-Freehold title really means a lot. (So, cut your grass.)-An individual has inherent rights, no matter what the state wants.-You need an elected legislature, and even elected municipal governments.-Like religion as much as you want, but the governments calls the administrative shots. (Historically, Quebec had an utterly different view.)-Buy and sell. Business is central to life.-What's mine is mine.-You can speak your mind, more or less.-Be patriotic about your country.If I wanted to define the outer limits of my matrix, I could use the standard of all countries, where these principles generally apply. The USA, Canada, Britain, Australia and New Zealand evolved in somewhat different ways, but none of them evolved away from this common, mostly British-created, ideological core.So, What's The Big Deal About Canada-America?The USA got to be a big, powerful country, because it got hold of the central portion of a highly-productive continent. However, think if Australia was full of arable land, instead of the Nullarbor Plain, vestigial Lake Eyre and numerous deserts. Australia is similar in size to the continental USA. Australia has about 25,000,000 people. Just think what it would be like if it had 250,000,000! Much of Asia would be shaking in its boots. There would be some very grandiose Australian thinking. Rural Australia isn't all that short on social conservatism. Australia would have some serious culture wars and maybe Australian politics would squeeze out a Trump or two. (For Australians, One Nation, but much bigger and more powerful, and even meaner and nastier.)What if Canada wasn't mostly a frigid wasteland? What would we Canadians do if Canada had 370,000,000 people, instead of 37,000,000. Would Justin Trudeau be wielding a handgun, pointing it at foreigners, and saying, “Be nice just like us, or else!I think the cultural and economic differences between the USA, and all the British matrix countries, have a lot to do with demographic and geographical size and economies of scale. The United States Constitution eliminated the concept of British ethnicity as the core of the nation. The United States Constitution created a principles-based country, and principles-based lifestyles, but the principles were mostly products of Britain, and its culture and heritage. As far, as I know, no one suggested that the new United States Constitution ought to be issued in numerous, equally legal, different language versions. The USA is a lot about size. English-speaking Canada accepts the same principles, but, politically, it is not a country, and demographically and economically, it isn't big.Variations On The Same ProblemAll these British-based countries faced some of the same problems. The solutions each one tried to devise, create much of the variations off of the common core, but these aren't so much related to national size:-What to do about indigenous peoples? (Britain too. Great Britain consists of England taking over several smaller countries, not necessarily with their consent.)-What to do about “white ethnics”? The United Kingdom does stumble severely over this. A pub with a Polish-language sign can be a Brexiteering crisis. The USA responded with Frank Sinatra, Dean Martin, Jerry Lewis, Bobby Vinton and Seinfeld. They gave that melting pot a good stir. Canada does folk dance multicultural festivals.-What to do about non-whites? Britain says they are much less problematic than people who speak Polish. We know what the USA did. Canada has political correctness and the Caribana festival.-What to do about women? A fraught problem throughout the British-origin world. When, and should, a man's castle turn into a gender-free castle?-Who has to pay what share of the taxes?-What to do about the poor? Charles Dickens produced excellent literature for the entire English-speaking world, describing the traditional British approach. You could almost call, “A Christmas Carol”, an historic starting point in the development of differentiating, British-origin approaches, to this problem.Americans And Canadians Stumble Over Geographic ProximityI would have to search Streetview up and down to find a Canadian example of all-American life that is as good as the suburbs of Melbourne. The 49th parallel makes Canada seem almost too close, and creates excessive expectations of similarity. Melbourne proves my point.Canadians and Americans would be better off to look at that matrix of countries that is defined by the British culture and heritage. Personally, I wonder whether Australia is basically more similar. If nothing else, when you speak of Australia, you are speaking of the entire country, not just one language-defined group, in a bilingual country.Martin LevineCan you explain social justice in right wing terms?September 1, 2018Social justice means different things to different people. So does right wing. “Right wing” could mean socially conservative, fiscally conservative, libertarian or alt-right. Depending upon which of these is the core philosophy of a right wing person, the way one would explain social justice to them will defer.Wikipedia provides this useful article on the meaning of social justice:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/So...“Social justice is a concept of fair and just relations between the individual and society. This is measured by the explicit and tacit terms for the distribution of wealth, opportunities for personal activity, and social privileges. In Western as well as in older Asian cultures, the concept of social justice has often referred to the process of ensuring that individuals fulfill their societal roles and receive what was their due from society. In the current global grassroots movements for social justice, the emphasis has been on the breaking of barriers for social mobility, the creation of safety nets and economic justice.Social justice assigns rights and duties in the institutions of society, which enables people to receive the basic benefits and burdens of cooperation. The relevant institutions often include taxation, social insurance, public health, public school, public services, labour law and regulation of markets, to ensure fair distribution of wealth, and equal opportunity.”Fair And Just?What if you simply don't believe that “fairness” and “justice” has much to do with life? I think that some of the more religious rightists may have some difficulty with what they might be feeling or thinking. If you believe or feel that human life is basically a zero-sum game, where only the strong are likely to survive, and where those who are more able and more aggressive, above all, have the right to their just deserts, how can you believe in social justice? Even if you believe in mercy and charity, what entitles weaker or lazier people, or people who are just plain unlucky, to a share of anything others have earned? Isn't it the responsibility of any individual, no matter who they are, to obtain a decent life by means of worship, personal prayer and obeying the commandments of their own religion?Being a lefty-lib person myself, it makes me uncomfortable to say it, but in a democratic society people have a right to this point of view. I would have to say to social justice advocates, that your philosophy is not all encompassing of society. You can't force someone to believe in something. The best you can do is to enforce compliance. And even then, what justification do you have?And, I have to admit it, even in the case of the supposedly “leftist” Canada, there are a lot of aspects of life that social justice isn't expected to encompass, or there is a clash of expectations about whether it should. We see it in the workplace. Supposedly, people employed in a given workplace are meant to compete for promotion. Strictly speaking, the “best and the brightest” are meant to get ahead. But, placed against that, there can be an overlay of equity and affirmative action policies. I spent years in the public service of Canada, listening to senior managers and human resources specialists saying that these two approaches can be reconciled. My opinion is, no, they can't. If one believes that, justice, in everyday life, means that the most competent and hardest-working should receive their rewards, then it is impossible. Unless social justice is seeking to stop discrimination and the denial of a “level playing field” to advance in life, social justice is in direct conflict with personal justice. “Redress” is not an argument you can make to me, if I was not personally the perpetrator.However, if one's idea of right wing incorporates racial superiority, then they are accepting their own collectivist view of society. Personal justice isn't a part of this philosophy.Institutionalized Things That Seem Like Social JusticeCanada, like most industrial democracies, has a somewhat comprehensive social safety net. Does this reflect a universal Canadian thirst for social justice? No. Right wing people, even within Canada, could put their minds somewhat more at ease if they understood why this is.Canada has plenty of “win big”. Choosing the right stock portfolio can make all the difference between a luxurious retirement and a minimal one, with rather heavy reliance on social assistance. A smart choice in self-employment, plus a ton of hard work, can put you far ahead.So, where is all this Canadian social justice socialism? Long ago, what partially drove the creation of the current Canadian system was Christian socialism, the idea that Jesus Christ demanded social justice. However, once the institutionalized system of social benefits was up and running, this view largely faded out. The system became more about social order, much more than social justice.I remember, many years ago, having a rather strong discussion, oddly enough in a gay bar, with a member of the Conservative Party of Canada. He was going on at length about personal responsibility, hard work, social benefits making poor people lazy, being unnecessary if people would just work, etc. I got kind of bored. Also, I don't trust discussions about aggregates of people, that are aggressively high level and conceptual. Finally, I said, rather bluntly I admit, “What are you going to do with them. Gas them?”. He had no reply.Those Adults Who Can't Make ItI would offer any right winger a downbeat view of society. There are maybe five to ten percent of the adult population that just aren't there. Some of them are pathologically lazy, but some of them are severely disabled, or are mentally feeble, or have neurologically-dictated cognitive problems, or foetal alcohol syndrome, or had such vile parenting when they were kids, that even the most intensive therapies can't bring them back.One way or another, a functioning country has to manage these people. If you are really quite far right, you could argue an approach that has certainly been done before, sterilize them or give them euthanasia. However, if you aren't really up for that, what would you like your government to do? The government could institutionalize them, or try to “support them in the community”. Or, the government could just jail any of them that engage in criminal behavior, while setting the bar for what is criminal quite low. (You loiter, you are intoxicated in public, you are begging on the street, off to jail with you!)I don't think it is social justice when a government selects a non-incarcerative strategy to this part of society. There is no need to argue that these people have an entitlement, or are all the victims of social injustice. Most social assistance workers haven't got the time for that. Their job is to get that person off the street, using whatever menu their government employer has to offer. Above all, they have a caseload to manage. What they are doing in their job is social order protection, not social justice.When People Lose, Keep Them QuietYou don't have to have a disability, to lose a lot in your personal life. People lose jobs, even when they aren't lazy. Or, you never were given enough education. Or, the region you live in takes an economic hit. Or, you get sick with something they can cure, but it all costs.The administration of a country can deal with these types of situations, or not deal with them, in different ways. Believing in social justice can guide some of it. However, some of it has to with curtailing costs. These people can be allowed to get poor. This tends to result in a lot of policing or incarceration costs. Or, you can try to get them back in the game again. You can try to retrain them, have employment insurance for them until they can get another job, or move them some place where they have a better chance to get one. Also, you can give them enough subsidized housing and medical care, or make sure that their kids get a decent education, so they don't become a second generation dependent population. I would say, to a right winger, who thinks there is an objectionable social justice strategy going on, look at the bottom line. Your country or your local government is going to run costs anyhow. What is most efficient?Social Justice Warriors Aren't The Same As Social JusticeWhen you read comments in Quora, you see a sizable number of people who seem to be right wing, one way or another, who are very angry about social justice warriors. I have said it before. Being a self-identified social justice warrior is a stance, often a highly personal, angry one, that may have a tenuous link, or none, to whatever social justice might be. Wearing pink hair, and shaking your fist in a street march, can feel really good, but that is about you, not the issue at hand.Sift out personal urges from social justice warring, and you tend to find a certain ideological stance. It is grievance and group-based. The assertion is, I believe that some identifiable groups in society have suffered discrimination and harrassment. They are entitled to redress. And, that should be the core of political life. This is so patently obvious, that those who do not agree are obviously very ill-intentioned, or more likely bad.Some right wingers would offer a reverse argument, your demands for your group create discrimination against my group. Or, you could say, “so what”? Get over it! Deal with your life as an individual, instead of claiming some sort of unwarranted group right. Or, the money to provide whatever redress you want isn't there. Or, you look and behave so grotesquely that there is no reason for us, or me, to deal with you. Or, you are not emotionally well. Or, since you don't wish to compromise or negotiate, I won't.I don't think most right wing people could ever make their peace with the social justice warriors, if this type of person is what they mean. However, a rational person needs to ask, how many people like are there? Do they represent anyone other than themselves? How much influence are they going to have? How much time do you want to spend on them? Is there anyone else you should spend more time opposing? And, how many of those people might simply be personally very-troubled or even mentally ill?Where Is The Social Justice You Are Concerned About, And Who Is Doing It, And Why?In a democratic society a right wing person has the right to oppose social justice. As I mention above, it isn't that hard to express a philosophy about why you oppose it.What I would suggest, to a right-wing person who wants to be effective in their opposition, is to make sure that what you are seeing is social justice, or something else. You might even want to start by taking that evocative word, “social”, right out of it until you are satisfied that you want to apply it.Crazy PeopleThis is pretty basic and probably not hard to accept for most right wing people. Any given country is an assemblage of individuals. Society is how individuals participate in a world where life is mostly about dealing with others. Some people just can't. They might not be mentally well or just too self-indulgent or confused. When you are looking at someone who you see as an advocate for social justice, particularly the extreme ones you so much dislike, remember, you may not be looking at a clever plot, you may just be looking at disturbed individual. Unless you believe they could somehow be influential, don't spend time on them. You are applying a screen.Managing Your CountryUnless you are an anarchist, you are likely to believe that the country you live in, and your province or state, and your municipality, requires management. So, what should those managers do about it managing those who can't, or won't, pull their weight? Any country approaches this somehow. What is your bottom line on how tough you want them to be? Are those managers willing to be flexible or pragmatic, or, in your opinion, have they gotten into a collectivist, entitlement, grievance-oriented mode?Look At The Bottom LineA lot of right wingers are business people. They now what a bottom line is. If you believe in managing your country, how do you evaluate what is the best bottom line? Do you believe that those who are in control are so committed to that collectivist, entitled. grievance oriented model, that they just don't care? If you don't believe they are, are you really seeing a manager incompetence problem, not too much social justice?Focus, And State Your ViewsYour views don't mean much, unless you can get them across and make them look convincing. I would suggest that a right winger, who has views about social justice, is going to be a lot more effective at making a strong argument, if they apply the filter I suggest above. Otherwise, you can end up being like my Conservative Party of Canada, gay bar, friend, spouting off in the abstract and having no reply when you ask him to justify his specifics.Maybe it sounds odd for a lefty-lib to be offering this kind of advice to right wingers, but I fear what will happen to social justice, if someone out there isn't offering a counter-argument and a rebuttal. Advocates for social justice can sometimes end up being dogmatic, expressing their pride, forgetting about the realities of budgets and taxes, or, too often, can be somebody looking for a steady, well paid government job that they didn't earn. The criticism from the right wing will help stop this sort of cave-in, or curtail social justice measures that are so ill-conceived, or so expensive, that the whole welfare state will be discredited.Martin LevineDid predictions & promises made in favor of NAFTA in the early ‘90s come true?August 29, 2018I am speaking from the Canadian point of view.To a large extent, no. But, we don't know what would have happened if NAFTA had not come into existence, or if other trade arrangements had taken place.Canada and the United States already had a free trade agreement in effect before NAFTA:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ca...NAFTA never cancelled this agreement. It just sort of put it away.Previous to that, there was the 1965 Auto Pact, regarding the Canada and American automobile industries:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ca...NAFTA was an effort to bring Mexico into the North American free trade system. It isn't evident that Canada benefitted all that much from Mexico's inclusion. In fact, Canada lost a large part of its automotive industry to Mexico. Mexico has not been an especially large market for Canadian goods and services. Other than trade with the USA, Canadian trade is still very much focused on the European Union and Pacific Rim countries. Of course, if Brexit occurs, Canada might want to negotiate an additional agreement with the United Kingdom.Just For The Big ShotsNAFTA was, to a large extent, about the needs and desires of big corporations. It made it easier for large companies to create integrated, three country production chains. It also secured more of a level playing field for large scale investors, who wanted to invest in other NAFTA countries.As I recall, at the time of NAFTA, it was suggested that the general public of Canada would also benefit. The public was told that there would be greater ease in buying goods and services from the other two countries, without having to pay tariffs. It was suggested that the price of a lot of things would come down. Also, it was suggested that there would be a lot more freedom for Canadians to take up employment in the other two countries.We don't know what retail prices in Canada would have been, without NAFTA. From what Canadians see on our store shelves, low-priced Chinese goods have been the most help in providing Canadians with low-cost items.American and Mexican manufacturers do not account for all that much of the clothing and small appliances consumed in Canada. However, partially American-made cars are a large part of the total retail market. American manufacturers provide a large part of the production goods and services that Canadian businesses use to do their own manufacturing and service provision. American-manufactured software could be considered to dominate the Canadian software market.But, lowering or eliminating tariffs, and giving Canadian, Mexican and American companies more freedom to invest across borders, may not have reduced the average Canadian consumer's costs all that much. There are other factors which may be much more important in causing the still significantly higher prices in Canada. Taxes are higher here. Goods have to be carried long distances, but, with Canada's modest-sized population, there are limited economies of scale. Provincially-set minimum wages are frequently higher than their state equivalents in the USA. Unionization is more prevalent. Even heavy heating and snow removal costs are a factor.There is another issue that is quite important, ""historic price levels"". With Canada's small markets, there is not all that much competition in supplying retail goods. A lot of Canada's total retail business is conducted by a relatively compact number of nation-wide chains, either Canadian or foreign-owned, for example, Shopper's Drug Mart, Rexall, Costco, Walmart, Home Depot, Rona, Canadian Tire, the Bay, Winners, McDonald's, Subway, Burger King, etc. It is not an especially competitive retail environment. Retail prices had always been higher in Canada. When NAFTA arrived, why would Canadian retailers cut the average consumer a break?But, there is another, very important factor, the fluctuating value of the Canadian dollar. The Canadian dollar used, many years ago, to be consistently near par with the American one. However, in the past couple of decades, it has approached becoming a ""petrodollar"", that only approaches or exceeds par when world oil prices are very high. At one time, the Government of Canada attempted to support the Canadian dollar at a fixed level, but they gave up on this strategy. The Canadian ""free market"" dollar has slid in recent years to near historically low levels. This makes all foreign goods and services considerably more expensive, NAFTA or not.No Loopholes For The Little PeopleThe Canadian government that negotiated NAFTA, and every federal government since, have upheld the same principle, ""We are not going to let the average Canadian shopper bypass the retailers of Canada, by doing their own shopping in the USA."" To some extent, the Canadian public was lead to believe that they would be allowed to do just that. Instead, the federal and provincial governments have kept that shopping lid on.This Government of Canada mini-guide is straight and to the point:https://travel.gc.ca/returning/c...""Returning after less than 24 hours •There are no personal exemptions for cross-border shoppers""So much for NAFTA at the consumer retail level. Much of Canada's population lives within a few hour's drive of the United States border, but, don't you dare think of making a shopping day-trip there!""

When I read the current shopping limits, I feel like I am back in 1958. I remember a common Manitoban tradition, what you might call a ""scissors party"". Off we went to Grand Forks, North Dakota, the Winnipeg shopper's, Aladdin's cave of the very upper Mid-West. Clothes were cheap, cheap, cheap. So, were linens. You did your 48-hour weekend, and at the end, before leaving your motel room, out came the scissors that you had thoughtfully brought along. You cut off every last tag that demonstrated that this article had been manufactured in the USA. Another good tactic was to hide your brand new American apparel in your dirty laundry, and hope that the Canada Customs guys would find it too distasteful to go there. (I am not suggesting that my family would ever do such a thing!)Say, in spite of all this, your modern Winnipegger is off to a weekend in Grand Forks. Nowadays, the State of North Dakota offers an online sales tax rebate:https://www.nd.gov/tax/canadianr...However, on the way home, when you hit the border, if you have exceeded your weekend C$ 200.00 limit, you will be charged the federal and Manitoba combined sales tax:https://www.gov.mb.ca/jec/invest..."" Sales TaxationIn addition to customs duties, imported goods are subject to the 5% Federal Goods and Services Tax (“GST”) and the 8% Manitoba Retail Sales Tax. The GST and Retail Sales Tax are discussed in the taxation pages of the Manitoba Business Facts.President Trump has made Canadian dairy supply management into a domestic, American mid-term campaign issue. However, when NAFTA was negotiated, it was made clear, Canada would not let lower American dairy prices benefit the Canadian consumer. The Americans were well aware of this when they signed the agreement.So, NAFTA never gave a break to the average Canadian consumer, despite anything that was promised, implied or predicted.And You Are Not Going to Get A Job There EitherNAFTA included a relatively limited schedule of jobs which residents of the three countries could migrate, across borders to, freely:https://www.canada.ca/en/immigra...At the time the agreement was being negotiated, the Canadian public was lead to believe the list would be expanded. However, no American Administration since, has had much interest in that. Individual workers were not given the migratory freedoms that big companies were. The concept of freer movement of labour, across the NAFTA internal boundaries, came to a static, dead end.Mexico Will Get Better?The implicit promise of NAFTA was that, after a certain, relatively limited time, Mexico would become a ""First World"" country. Mexico's large population might then have actually been a big market for Canadian goods and services. Now, one has to ask, was this implicit promise, cynicism? NAFTA proved that more cross-border freedom for corporations could not break a rigid social class system, or deeply entrenched corruption, supported by violence. It is now twenty-three years since NAFTA was signed, and the United States is still having to make an issue of very low wages in Mexican car plants.So, What Now?At best, this current week might see an agreement in principle between all three NAFTA countries. The USA in particular, will have a political process of some length before Congress gives its final approval.It does not appear that any renegotiated NAFTA would fulfill the unmet promises and predictions that were made to Canadians about the old one. Maybe Canada will concede a larger squirt of American milk into the Canadian market. Maybe Canada will raise the limit on duty-free cross border shopping some, while at the same time making Customs inspections at the Canadian border more draconian. (So, Canada Customs will put on surgical gloves, and search your dirty laundry.) Other than that, there is no apparent gain to the average Canadian, no lower retail prices, no seriously more lenient cross-border shopping, no increased opportunities for cross-border work.If the USA and Mexico make their own agreement, President Trump can call it whatever he likes. It will not be the successor of NAFTA.If President Trump secures congressional approval to terminate NAFTA, strictly speaking, the old Canada-US free trade agreement will return from its slumber, because NAFTA never cancelled it. There seems to be considerable legal confusion about what this would mean. However, the old agreement didn't provide for lower Canadian retail prices, freer cross-border movement of labour, or freer cross-border shopping, any more than NAFTA did.Since it is impossible to state with any accuracy, we will never know what would have happened to employment within Canada if NAFTA had never existed. I recall Canadian factories shutting down, even when the Canada-USA agreement started. Canadian factories couldn't produce linens, furniture, major appliances or car tires as cheaply as American ones could. Maybe competition from low-wage countries might have shut them down anyhow, but who knows?So, there is no prospect, from the Canadian point of view, of NAFTA ever providing improved prices and better job opportunities for the average Canadian, nor even much more shopping fun on a weekend holiday. The current NAFTA negotiations, from the point of view of non-elite Canadians, are about a set of negatives.Martin LevineDo you think political correctness keeps us from being intellectually honest?August 26, 2018My first thought is, honest to myself or to others?The Merriam-Webster Dictionary provides this definition of political correctness, athttps://www.merriam-webster.com/...The definition of course is their property. I am quoting it for information purposes only:conforming to a belief that language and practices which could offend political sensibilities (as in matters of sex or race) should be eliminatedThe Cambridge Dictionary definition is similar. Again this definition is their property:https://dictionary.cambridge.org...Someone who is politically correct believes that language and actions that could be offensive to others, especially those relating to sex and race, should be avoided.A politically correct word or expression is used instead of another one to avoid being offensive:Wikipedia provides a detailed discussion of political correctness at:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Po...Wikipedia also provides a brief explanation of intellectual honesty:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In...One's personal faith does not interfere with the pursuit of truth;Relevant facts and information are not purposefully omitted even when such things may contradict one's hypothesis;Facts are presented in an unbiased manner, and not twisted to give misleading impressions or to support one view over another;References, or earlier work, are acknowledged where possible, and plagiarism is avoided.The Presentation Of Self In Everyday LifeThis title actually refers to the title of a 1956 book by the great, Manitoban sociologist, Erving Goffman. Professor Goffman was discussing the concept of “all the world is a stage”, and applying it to how individuals act out on that stage in everyday life.Given the definitions above, “political correctness” is a posture about an individual's communications with everyone else. I would break this out into conscience and unconscious strategies. You may have so incorporated political correctness into your behavioural style that you aren't even thinking about it. So, when you go into the office, you wouldn't even think about discussing anything but mild and inoffensive topics, such as hockey scores, a really good sale you went to on the weekend, whether there is a snowstorm coming, etc.On the other hand, you could be consciously measuring your words, gestures and expressions. You could be doing this for several reasons, individual or combined, including:-You are afraid of retribution if you say the wrong thing:-You honestly don't want to hurt anyone else's feelings, either for altruistic reasons, or because you are going to have to continue dealing with them.-You want to trick people into thinking you have a team player attitude.-You are not sure that you know what you are talking about, and do not want to receive a rebuttal that shows you are ignorant.Political correctness tends to refer to restricting someone from expressing their views about political and ideological issues, and the groups who hold them. However, I believe there is a not completely explored world of one on one political correctness. What does political correctness mean when you are communicating with just one individual, outside of a group context, and maybe outside of political and ideological issues? I think it happens. In terms of self-presentation on a daily basis, when should you not be direct with someone. Why would you “pull your punches”?What Does “Offend” or “Offensiveness” Mean?Even in politically correct Canada, there are limits on when offending someone or some group of people can become an official issue. Freedom of speech only cuts out at a threshold. For example, it is not a legal issue when, in your non-employment life, you engage in a critique of a given religion. You have the right to criticize a given individual, as long as you don't venture off into slander or libel.I can be outraged when someone launches a critique of Orthodox Judaism. (Non-orthodox Jews will.) It can really hurt my feelings and damage my pride in my heritage. However, I don't have any redress. If someone says something to the effect of, we ought to harass and attack Jewish people, because they are all orthodox and consequently, bad people, then Canada's laws provide me with plenty of redress. For that matter, someone else could say something very unpleasant about me personally. However, if the statements are not non-factual, and do not incorporate threats, then I do not have any official case to makeDespite the definitions, some of what appears to be political correctness, is not about offending someone and hurting their feelings. It is about whether someone or some group has received significant, unjustified damage. The reasons for those rules may be more legally and workplace oriented, than offensiveness-oriented. In Canada, the legitimate causes tend to be based on the Criminal Code of Canada, human rights laws, slander and libel laws and common law precedents, the right of an employer to run a work-oriented and high-production workplace, and federal and provincial requirements about providing a safe and respectful workplace. Often we are talking about deterring bullying, lying and threats, not people's hurt feelings. A lot of things happen in the workplace that can really hurt your feelings, without you having any redress.Are We Really Talking About Excessive Political Correctness?When political correctness means “shut up”, I don't think you are violating your own intellectual honesty by doing so. You are modifying your behaviour, not your own ideas and perceptions.What if your idea of ”intellectual honesty” includes the idea that intellectual honesty means that you must, or have the right to, speak out and be heard? Most democratic countries are not telling you that you don't. However, they do create consequences for wrongful speech, hate speech, lying speech, damaging speech, etc., based on where that speech is occurring.Political Correctness, And Your Intellectual Honesty, Are Context-BasedWhat entitles someone to speak out in the workplace? There is a well-recognized and legally-supported principle. There is no purpose for you being in a workplace, or participating in it online, other than to work. You have sold a large number of the minutes of your day to an employer. Your employer owns what you are required to do in those minutes. A standard requirement is, don't disrupt this workplace. Do not introduce any factors that will distract our employees from doing their job. Voluntarily accepting your job means that you have sold off hours of your freedom, including your freedom of speaking your mind. You have accepted that intellectual honesty does not belong in your workplace.There are other contexts where, effectively, you have given up the right to speak your mind. If you are a senior member of a political party, you have voluntarily given up your right to speak your view of the truth, at least publicly. There is a party platform and a party leader. Taking the position you now occupy, or, in the Canadian system, even being any elected member in a legislature, means that you have given up your right to speak freely. Being a member of a religious group is the same. If you accept to be a clergy person in that religion, you do not have the right to say what you like. Even if you are just a member of the congregation, you cannot disrupt servicesBut then, there are the shadowy, grey areas. For example, what if you are self-employed? If being free to speak, means freedom to deny service to people you disapprove of, there are legal issues that are not about offending people. The legal issues are about another person's rights to non-discriminatory treatment. You can probably get away with scowling as you serve that person, as long as you don't say anything.Then there is that common political correctness flash-point, the college campus. Supposedly, a university is where intellectual honesty ought to prevail. However, it is probably fair to say that, at some universities, the administration is tolerating or advocating the suppression of that honesty. They have given in to the pride of young, dogmatic, students without any real-world experience. Worse yet, some of the professors, out of their own ego or their cowardice, are complicit with the bullying.Does political correctness have any relevance over one's personal life, particularly over personal relationships with others and groups of others? Does intellectual honesty? Instinctively, I would say that, in this sphere of life, the threshold for what is not politically correct ought to be rather high. Even so, if you walk into a store, or order something in line, and use obscenities and threats against the staff, you can be denied service or even reported to the police.But, what if you are talking about your comportment on a date, or in a bar, or in a nightclub? If you are in a restaurant, or a bar, or in a club, the owner has a lot of rights over what can be said, or can happen there. If you are speaking to someone on line, or in person, I guess you can flame if you like, but if the other person flames you right back, what point is there about talking about your freedom not to be offended?I Don't Think Political Honesty And Intellectual Honesty Are The Real IssueJust think if lawyers were expected to obey the intellectual honesty rule that facts are to be presented in an unbiased manner, and not twisted to give misleading impressions or to support one view over another. How could they make a living?A lot of what political correctness is about, really refers to employers and others having the right to restrict what is said and done on their premises. How can you challenge that?And, a lot of what is meant to be political correctness really refers to laws about not causing harm and damage to other individuals and groups. These laws are not about about protecting somebody from being offended. And, normally, the harm and damage have to be significant. The legal principle of “de minimus not curat lex” (The law does not deal with trifles.) applies. If somebody comes up to me on the street and says, “I don't like Jews much.”, I can turned red-faced and jump and down, but I don't have grounds to call a cop or launch a law suit.However, I am not suggesting that inordinate political correctness does not happen. To be intellectually honest about it, when you decry it, you should not omit or refuse to refer to relevant facts and information that may contradict your hypothesis. However, I am not at all saying that freedom of speech is not very precious.This question has made me contemplate whether or not intellectual honesty is a duty. I have tried to be intellectually honest with myself, and painfully, I don't think it is.Outright plagiarism can be a legal issue. It's also an honesty and ethical one. But, the pursuit of truth, considering relevant facts, even when such things may contradict one's hypothesis and, presenting facts in an unbiased manner, and not twisting them to give misleading impressions or to support one view over another? I think it would be a good thing if everyone was required to observe this. But, that's not life. Sometimes a person couldn't maintain their sanity if they had to face all the facts about their life. Society, and even romance, accepts the idea of adversarial argument (How else could we have the Canadian House of Commons, or a dating website?), so you are entitled to be selective of facts and how you want people to interpret them.There are real issues of excessive political correctness. However, if your idea of intellectual honesty convinces you that some people really do deserve to be made offended, the legal protections given to others really will limit where you can do your offending.Martin LevineThe right goes too far when it verges into racism and fascism. At what point does the left go too far?August 25, 2018What does being “left” really stand for? There are a couple of competing, partial synonyms, being progressive, or being liberal, or social democratic, or socialist. In some ways these are states of mind.But what is “The Left?, This implies a group of people, organized and bound together by their adherence to certain beliefs and policies, that are engaging in a political programme to take power and implement their objectives.I don't know of any countries where people with left, or partially synonymous beliefs, are so united, that they all form one political front. It's certainly not the case in Canada or the USA.“Going too far” sorts of suggests that an alarm bell ought to ring, and an admonition go out, when people or groups on what is more or less “The Left” have begun to step over a certain defined, line. Who makes up the definitions and who is in a position to to, figuratively, ring the alarm and draft up the admonition? Ought it to be done from within whatever The Left means in the local context?Canada's Official Bell RingersIn a parliamentary system you have a certain, built in, “call-out” system for whatever The Left might locally be. Currently in Canada, at the federal level, it is more or less Her Majesty's Official Opposition, the Conservative Party of Canada. There are two parties to the left of it in the Canadian House of Commons, the Liberal Party of Canada (very slightly left of centre) and the New Democratic Party (social democratic to socialist.) This system is official. Her Majesty's Official Opposition is there to describe what they see as the mistakes and bad ideas of the party in power, maybe decry individual bad politicians who are more to or less to the left, explain just why the left wing policies are so bad, and what they would do is better.Were the Conservative of Party to be the party of power, they would still have the same function of decrying Liberal and NDP policies and politicians, and explaining to the Canadian electorate why they should never be in government.Of course Canada has its non-politician bell ringers, the media, the big business community and various other influencers. Whatever the Canadian left might be, it has a lot of oversight from outside. This frequently works, although the Liberal Party of Canada has a certain history of “doubling down” when they hear criticism they find unfair or humiliating. Political parties tend very strongly to be organized around an intense inner circle of top politicians, advisors and ideologues. This isn't just a political structure. It's an intense inner world, full of pride and emotions, even romance. It's probably the best job that some of these people will ever have. How can one bear vulgar criticism when one is so important?Left America Could Badly Use Some Focused Bell RingersIs the Democratic Party of the United States “The Left”? Well, maybe some groups and individuals and groups are part of it. Then there are a whole bunch of people and groups that are outside. This is different from Canada. There aren't one or two political parties that contain so much of The Left, or its partial synonyms, that they basically “own” most of it.Particularly in the USA, how do you “call out” all these disparate people and groups? Who is in a position to define what is “over the top?I am a Canadian. Could an American please explain to me what Nancy Pelosi's political programme is, and how much of the American left she controls? Ms. Pelosi is an older person. Who is her ideological heir apparent? What is the influence of Bernie Sanders? He certainly has a defined programme. However, if one aggregated together all the American voters who see themselves as left of centre, how many feel influenced and disciplined by him? Mr. Sanders is also a person of years. Is there anybody in particular who will take over his reins, and recreate the Democratic Party as the big tent, left/progressive party of America, with a plan to win the Presidency in 2020, and majorities in both houses of Congress?My Canadian question is, also, who are the recognized bell ringers of whatever the American left now is? Barack Obama used to do a fairly good job. But, who provides the discipline from within right now?I believe that the Liberal Party of Canada, and the New Democratic Party, are lucky to have the Conservative Party of Canada. The Conservative Party of Canada very definitely seeks to own conservatism at the federal level. While they do not have a highly ideological programme (More generally, their programme says that, “We can give you a competent Prime Minister. We will be more careful with the taxpayer's money, and we will not look down on the little Canadians, the ones who aren't so educated, aren't the most sophisticated, aren't the most networked, and who aren't the ones who get to live in the leafiest, most pleasant districts of Montreal, Toronto and Vancouver.”), they have a pretty good idea of what they don't want to advocate.The Canadian news media this past week have been full of Maxime Bernier, a leading Conservative Party Member of the federal Parliament. He has been advocating against agricultural supply management and against multiculturalism and diversity. Andrew Scheer, the leader of the Conservative Party of Canada, told him that was not acceptable, because the Conservative Party of Canada is strongly in favour of both (Farmers and members of ethnocultural minorities are a large part of the big tent that could see the Conservative Party become the governing party in the October 2019 federal elections.) Mr. Bernier would not desist from expressing his views. He got shown the ideological front door and is no longer a member of the Conservative Party of Canada.No Big Tent, No Defined LeftI could suggest that the, “enhance and guard your ego” approach to politics, goes beyond the headquarters of the Liberal Party of Canada. Why, after all, do people engage in politics? How many do it out of clear, clean altruism, with no concern to feel good about themselves, impressive to one's peers, attractive and powerful? I don't think there are a whole lot of people like that.That is where the official, political “big tent” comes in. The big tent says, “I don't agree with some of what you say, or particularly you, or your lifestyle, or the people you hang out with. But you are close enough. Let's get together and go win an election. Let's write up a platform, but, because we have our differences, we will leave it vague and not mention some things. Then, altogether everyone, let's go out there and market it. I would rather win public office than be a purist.” Big tent is saying, there have to be limits on everyone's pride, everyone's zeal, everyone's ideology, or at least, expressing it. Once you are in power, then maybe you might get into that inner circle. Then you can have some serious fun.Decry From Within?The Republican party of the United States is not currently in a position to be a consistent critic of whatever the American left is. The supposedly Republican President is more of an ego and anger-based free agent, twisting and turning to avoid prosecutions. “Lock her up” is not a meaningful critique of the American Left. He can't do that critique.The senior Republicans of the Senate and the House of Representatives don't seem interested, or maybe they just can't either. I am not sure why. Some of the the Republican senior politicians are also old. Maybe there is a reluctance to be seen as a political competitor to Donald Trump Jr. Or, maybe I just don't understand that the Republican Party is not like the Conservative Party of Canada. The American system doesn't seem to allow for one individual to be the recognized head of the Republican Party in both Houses of Congress, and with official control of the Republican Party apparatus. As I understand it, the expectation is that the President will be in charge of his members of both houses of Congress, plus the party machinery is. But if he ever was, he isn't now. The federal Republican Party has had its head lopped off.Without decryment from outside, whatever the American Left is, has to do it from within. Fox Media isn't in a good position to do it, not even CNBC. Maybe, if Bernie Sanders selects a clear heir apparent, that heir could. They could maybe approach it from the position of, “What will not give us that big tent that we need to become the Government of the USA.” If there was a person like that, it wouldn't be too hard for them to identify when individuals and groups in the American Left are going too far:-I am proud, I am very angry and I am sure I am right. Some of the so-called “Social Justice Warriors” sadly fall within this category. You accomplish absolutely nothing by marching around with pink hair, loudly shouting slogans and shaking your fist.-I don't care about the cost. A new or expanded social programme is going to cost taxpayer money. Be cavalier about that and your big tent will collapse like it was struck by a downdraft in a severe thunderstorm. Sanders, the Next Generation, needs to be able to say, “No, America can't afford it.”-I am going to take your property. It is nice to fantacise about utopian socialism, but very few Americans will fantacize along with you. You are going to scare a lot of Americans into re-electing Donald Trump Jr. in 2020.-I just so want to be in that back office. The Ottawa back office of the Liberal Party of Canada probably has more potential to bring the Liberal Party down then the Conservative Party of Canada. If an obnoxious, insular subculture forms there, the Conservative Party of Canada will know, and they will have a massive campaign plank. Supposed leftists who want The Left to be their personal conduit to a well-paid secure job and a swollen ego will bring The Left down.-It is all about me and mine. Those who honour social wedges are going too far. Some identity politics is unavoidable. However, when you position is, that we are the persecuted guys, and all progressive politics is about us, it will sink the American Left. Being Left means supporting a political programme that, as much as it can, is for everybody. It does not matter that you are very aggrieved about what has been done to people in your group. You have to look to the protection and support of everybody, even the ones who you think are perpetrators.-I am doing it for the social life. Politics can be a good way to find people who are on your wavelength. But, you can end up with the outer equivalent of that back room. You can end up in that often-stated house of mirrors, people with the same views endlessly bouncing them off each other. Then, you become loyal to your new friends. You want so much a member of that group that you will start advocating for things you don't really in. You participate in demonstrations when you should. You won't argue with the people in your inner circle, who express views you think are really nasty.Sure You Have Freedom Of Speech, But You Don't Have It In My PartyAny behaviour that stops a big-tent progressive party from winning office in a democratic system is going too far. Realistically, in the developed, democratic world, a left-wing party is one that wants to create solutions to many problems, for as many people in the country, particularly for situations that the free enterprise system can't or won't resolve. This means party discipline and boundaries to individual or group behaviour. Individuals and groups that won't comply need to be shown the door. Then they can advocate for whatever they want, just not in a political party.Doing this requires a party with real disciplinary structures. Those structures needs to identify supposed party supporters who aren't compliant. In a caring party, it is worthwhile to sit down with them, see if they are providing important new information, and talk with them about compromises and new solutions. However, somebody in authority does need to be empowered to decide that a group or individual is going to far, and needs to leave the party.Martin LevineWhat are your political views?August 23, 2018Politics are inherently specific to the country you are in. I would have to answer in the Canadian context, although I have lived in other countries.There is another question today about ""Why do most Jews tend to be left wing?"" I'm not all that left wing myself, but, maybe, for some of us, there is a little bit of truth. I see politics as always being on the defensive. It is almost like a real life game of whack-a-mole. If someone isn't criticizing you for personally having killed Jesus, then it is your ""cosmopolitanism"", or your banker capitalism, or your Communism, or your Zionism, or your bad attitude towards young, blonde, blue-eyed women. If I hear some Canadian politician whining about diversity, I wonder if he is pointing the finger right at me, or whatever he thinks I am. I start to get scared.Canada is rife with this sort of thing. It comes, not just from leading politicians, but from advocacy groups, the postal workers' union, the United Church of Canada, members of the federal and provincial legislatures who happily invite self-proclaimed terrorist supporters to their events, etc.Politics Starts from Number OneOne could describe my statement above as being about just that. Is left-right the start of my political ruminations? No. My personal fears and concerns are more important.I believe that, this is very often the case. You could be a dairy farmer, a nurse represented by a bargaining unit, a residential real estate agent, a construction worker, a small retailer, a retired farmer in a small Prairie town. You have certain needs and preferences around that. That, politically, is where a whole lot of people start from, even if they live in a dictatorship. Certainly in a democracy, political parties are trying to market a product, their promises above all, and a suite of policies.To a considerable extent because of the social media, we hear a lot from political ideologists. They talk very loudly and get themselves a core of enthusiasts. However, it really takes a dictatorship of a particular kind to convince much of the population that they are one, featureless block. The Nazis were very good at this type of indoctrination. Stalin, maybe not so much. Raw terror was a better social controller than trying to convince every citizen that authoritarian socialism is the solution to everything. Victorian Britain had a strong ideology of racial superiority that appealed to many British people of the time. I believe that both Czarist and communist Russia had a strong, widely-liked presumption about Russian cultural superiority.Politics Is A Media ProductNot that many people are going to personally encounter a leading politician. We rely on traditional and other media for most of our political information.Unless you are talking about someone free-forming in a politically-oriented blog, or people declaiming their political views in something like Quora, media politics is an industry. I think of Marshall McLuhan's observation that, ""The medium is the message."" The mechanics of whatever medium it is, plus the career interests of those who compose media stories, can be a lot more important than the content.There is a lot of talk nowadays about the twenty-four hour news cycle. So, say for broadcast television, what does that mean? Unless it is a completely non-commercial product, TV news is about selling advertising. (How many people would be prepared to pay for a subscription news channel, as opposed to spending their money on Netflix?) This means that news coverage can only be allowed to cost the media company concerned, a certain defined amount, and that advertising revenue must be maximized.So, it is 7:30 in the morning, on a weekday. You are stuffing down your breakfast cereal and coffee, before rushing off to work. You turn on a cable news channel. What do you see, the stories of the last twenty-four hours, made to seem as new, important and emotive as possible, repeated, repeated and repeated, in part because more content would cost the media company a lot. The news starts repeating itself before you get to the bottom of your cereal bowl.Say you are having a slow morning at work, so you have the time to consider what the cable news channel told you over your cereal. Donald Trump is unpredictable, has had various girlfriends (The broadcast includes a still photo of a wonderful Playboy Bunny.), and uses vulgar, accusatory language. The NAFTA negotiations are about to be completely wrapped up, or will cataclysmically fail, by this afternoon. Included, is a brightly coloured chart of the impending collapse of the Canadian auto industry, based on the opinion of one or two economists. (Cable news channels have been providing this type of treat to Canadians for the past year.) A few grandmothers in British Columbia are demonstrating peaceful civil disobedience against new oil pipelines, yet again. It makes for the same attention-getting visual, inspiring, self-righteous, middle-class grannies in hippy clothes, versus the patriarchal and authoritarian, right-wing, bulldozer. It is really, really, very important that pre-market trading indicates that the Toronto Stock Exchange will open down fifty points from yesterday's close, the news reader looking very grim.I am sitting at my office work station, trying to pretend I am not unbusy. I think about this morning's cereal broadcast, and begin to feel like an 1890's Yukon gold prospector, panning away futilely at some frigid creek, that has not even one tiny nugget left in it. I didn't learn one damn thing that I didn't already know about, and maybe decided that I don't care about, long before. If I had a smart TV, and really wanted to learn something politically relevant, I would have been far better off to check out the latest Web edition of the Statistics Canada Daily. I could observe that multiple-unit residential building starts in the Greater Toronto Area are grossly below what is needed to satisfy demand, and then I could have something new to shudder sincerely about. Or, maybe I would have had a better start to my day by listening to classical music, and then asking myself what the federal government is doing about providing generous grants to Canada's symphony orchestras.Much of modern politics is driven by content in the formal media, that fails to prioritize, fails to put events in a meaningful context, attempts to generate an emotional response when it is not warranted, and repeats the same stories in a way that comes close to brainwashing.Should You Play Your Own Devil's Advocate?As I say above, my primary political stance is fending off cheap shots, that could turn dangerous, from various individuals and groups in Canadian society, that personally object to me. because of whatever they think I am, Semite behaving badly, crafty international banker, personal advisor of the Grand Rabbi, dues-paying member of the Illuminati, evil lizard from outer space, etc.Then, I sort of refine my political views by opposing them, playing the Devil's Advocate against my own political wishes. As such, I have to object to anything that penalizes me, when I have no or minimal responsibility for whatever the penalty is about.Generally, I want very much to see myself as lefty-lib. I support equity, affirmative action and job equality and freedom from any type of harassment, for women. However, frankly, some of what once were highly justifiable causes are shading off into extremism, opportunism and bigotry. I am not a patriarch. I am not responsible for the atrocities that the grandparents of modern British-origin Canadians committed against indigenous ones, nor can I agree that attempting to shore up resourceless, periodically flooded reserves, with infusions of tax money, is going to help First Nations people. Rather, I support tax-supported assistance to help indigenous Canadians be successful in urban life. I think that urban reserves can be a good idea. However, there has to be a lot of integration. Sometimes you just can't be successful in Winnipeg unless you speak English, behave in a middle-class way and wear a business suit.I do not agree that any equity or affirmative action programme ought to be ongoing. I believe that every such programme should receive a periodic audit, and when the objectives have been reached, be shut down. If it hasn't been, and I lose a promotion as a result, I am the one who is suffering from discrimination.Politics is, above all, about taxing and spending, and how much gets spent on what. I strongly support the comprehensive Canadian social safety net. However, I have the uneasy feeling that income taxes for working and middle class Canadians are as high as they can reasonably be. As I understand it, there simply are not enough very rich people in Canada that, raising their income taxes, and closing off their tax loopholes, is going to raise enough money for major new social programmes. Consequently, I believe it is very impressive when a Canadian politician presents what, in any given year, can reasonably be expected in terms of government revenues, the entire, audited cost of each government programme, and can explain what has, or has not been achieved. In the interests of Canadian social democracy, every social programme at every level of government, should have clear, publicly-stated, single year and multi-year objectives, but, also publicly available annual and multi-year audits. I am very impressed when a party in power, or a municipal mayor, admits that a given programme has simply failed and must be scrapped.Watch The MunicipalitiesAs a personal view, poorly functioning municipal governments are a much greater part of Canada's problems than they are given credit for. It is very unfortunate that some of the traditional media see municipal politics as the reporting little leagues. A lot of Canadian municipal politicians take developer interests too seriously. (Of course, developers make campaign contributions.) Sprawl is still happening far too much. Infrastructure is being provided to different parts of a municipality on the basis of social class. Zoning laws are designed to impede densification. Infill housing and higher buildings are prohibited. Retail zoning keeps some streets sterile and unwalkable. Even bar closing laws are antediluvian.I believe that larger Canadian cities need a parliamentary, party system of government, with platforms. (As I understand it, this is already the case in Quebec.) For example, so we want to have intensification, how does your municipal political party propose to do it? I would be impressed by a provincial government that would make the necessary changes to bring it about.International Affairs Do Not Need A Lot of EmotionsI am not a Liberal Party supporter, but I credit the current Liberal federal government, for not responding to emotionalized American trade negotiating tactics and statements with more emotions. Foreign trade is about business and it is really complex to negotiate. It requires negotiations by professional trade experts, sitting behind closed doors. Arbitrary timelines, driven by media attempts to create an exciting story, should be rejected outright. The attitude should be, ""It will be done when it is done.""Canada is not a powerful enough economic or military player to be decisive on the international scene. I am impressed when a political party admits it.Watch Your BureaucratsHaving been a bureaucrat all my adult working life, I would say, don't trust them. There is plentiful self-orientation in any civil service, avoidance of responsibility, more than a dollop of stupidity and sufficient amounts of laziness.Canada, and its provinces and municipalities, have to rely on its public sector bureaucracy to exist, and, especially, to run its social safety net. But the bureaucratic system is set up to provide secure employment and freedom from embarrassment or responsibility, for the most senior bureaucrats. At the federal and municipal levels, ""ministerial responsibility"" is used as an excuse. This is more important than the public interest.Whether you are conservative or liberal in your bent, think how things would be, if poor advice from an individual, identified, Associate Deputy Minister or Director General, was admitted as the cause of a failed, unfair or overspending programme? What if the identified senior administrator was given the right of reply, without prejudice? How would it be, when for any current or proposed programme, the government responsible was required to account for the size, pay level and deployment of all the employees involved, and justify the ratio of senior managers to line workers? What if the government responsible was required to explain what sort of employee training was going on, why, and to which types of employees in particular?I believe that, of all the policies, changes and expenditures that one could demand from government, this is maybe the most important one, and it won't happen.Martin LevineWhat is something most science fiction gets wrong?August 20, 2018This question is rather similar to ""Which unrealistic science fiction tropes annoy you the most? Why?"", which also appears in Quora today. I cannot think of any science fiction tropes that really annoy me, but there are some that do not seem to be realistic, in terms of what the future is likely to offer, and there are some that are not so well ""fleshed-out"", due to production costs and audience sensitivities.I should note that some of the Answers that I have seen for these two questions really are to the point, and amusing. I should also note that I am a Star Trek fan. I would tend to call Star Wars, maybe science fantasy.It's All AmericaI can understand why the producers and writers of Star Trek had to walk on their tippy-toes around this one. We know that the human race managed to recover from a Fourth World War, develop a planet-wide government and, using warp drive, subspace radio, phasers, photon torpedoes, tractor beams, transporters, etc., go out in space and, with the kind assistance of the altruistic and compassionate Vulcans, became a part of a NATO-type alliance gone interstellar. (We aren't precisely told whether the United Federation of Planets is also a European Union-type free trading and free migration zone.)However, at least the Planet Earth part of the Federation, is distinctly American in tone and in values. (It is basically a life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness situation, except that somehow, the world has a kind of comprehensive, Canadian-type, social safety net.) We also know that, Iowa, Alaska, and presumably other parts of what was the USA, are still identifiable entities. San Francisco is very certainly still there, complete with the Coit Tower, the Golden Gate Bridge and the Transamerica Pyramid. So is Anchorage.And, for us Canadian Trekkies, we know that the University of Manitoba is still up and running. ""The Trouble with Tribbles"" and one or two other references, indicate that Manitoba is still, kind of boring, whether it is still a province, became a State of the Union (Aiyeee!), or whatever. And, just additionally, London is still there and so is Paris, complete with the Eiffel Tower still intact, and the outdoor cafes.So, what kind of Fourth World War was it? At best, I guess it was, a limited nuclear exchange not that focused on North America and Europe, combined with the partial decline of the nation-state system (Except that in, Star Trek: Enterprise, it is made clear that the Royal Navy still exists. So, who runs it? Is there still a Westminster Parliament, a Ministry of Funny Walks and British Fed-Exiteers?) I can see why, just flat out saying that, the United States of America was disbanded on such and such a date, would outrage a sizable part of Star Trek's American core audience. However, you also get the strong feeling that worldwide peace, prosperity, free trade and open borders was achieved, by every other country simply agreeing to join the United States of America.Actually, the world-as-America trope goes back a long way before Star Trek. It appears in the Twilight Zone, in black and white. and with everybody still 1959 uptight. In fairness, Star Trek: Enterprise did try to provide clues about what happened, alt-right folks objecting vociferously to the Earth having an open border for Federation migrants, demanding solar system isolationism to make Earth Great Again, and wearing anachronistic business suits to express their social conservatism.So, What Happened to Money and Religion?Again, the lack of specifics doesn't just apply to Star Trek. But, it is sort of glaring there.We are lead to believe that poverty has been vanquished from the Federation, although, in Star Trek: Voyager, it makes a near comeback as a result of nearly losing the war with the Klingons. However, money sure hasn't dropped out of the Ferengi home world, and others.So, how, exactly, do the economics of Planet Earth and the Federation, go on? It is made clear that there are still star-travelling freight ships, so goods are still being transported around, presumably for sufficient due compensation. What happens with trade with other, still-monied, warp capable civilizations? What about trade secrets and intellectual property?Captain Picard and others lead us to believe that, as a result of highly-advanced technology, the Federation can crank out so much goods and services, that nobody could be in want. But, does that mean that you get your living accommodations by application to a governmental authority? Does socialistic distribution apply to your furniture, your wall hangings, your art work, your food orders (Perish the thought that all your calories would come from replicated blah!), your clothes (Paris is shown in Star Trek: The Next Generation, as still having haute couture.), etc. How did Harry Kim swing having a bachelor pad in the conveniently historic district of San Francisco, meaning that they didn't have to go to the high cost of depicting a futuristic, detailed, street scene? Deep down, I suspect that there is a two-tiered system operating, no-cost basics, but you still need money for the good stuff (The Canada we all want for the future.). Harcourt Fenton Mudd kind of alludes to this in two different series.I am not suggesting that religion is the flip-side of money. However, I cannot help but notice that people with names from my ethnocultural group pop up in Star Trek. No more Judaism anymore, or what? (In Blade Runner, it is made clear that Chassidism is doing just fine.) Does Dr. Bashir have any recollection of his religious heritage? Of course, there is the question that Star Trek, and any multi-episode science fiction series, needs to completely avoid, just what happened to Christianity?In the meantime, some other civilizations are just as religious as they can possibly be. Certainly, the Bajorans are not short on doctrine. However, Britain is still keeping calm and carrying on, but there is no Archbishop of Canterbury? If a future me got posted on a starship, and, in all likelihood, I am completely socially-isolated, am I allowed to have a holo-synagogue, holo-delicatessen and kosher holo restaurant, or a holo 1958 Las Vegas nightclub? Nightclubs exist on holodecks, but, what if I want to have one with a Yiddish, vulgar, deeply offensive, misogynistic comedian programme? Is the starship chief medical officer going to write me down as seclusive, supposedly because I am spending too much time on the Holodeck, instead of compromising my principles and my ethno-cultural heritage, by hanging out in the Ten Forward Lounge?It's Still The Same Old Story. A Fight For Love And Glory.Star Trek, and not a few other science fiction stories and series, are written from the point of view of spaceship crews with military-type discipline. However, presumably only a space North Korea could have a substantial part of its entire population in the military.While I am not a Star Wars fan, I have to concede that they have combined warp drive technology with the concept of grubby, nasty, human, non-human, or multiple-species environments. The sentient entities in those environments, practise slavery, get drunk in crumby bars, have impure thoughts, get really aggressive and unpleasant with each other, and lie, cheat and steal, more or less the reality of human life as we have known it, probably since our pre-human male ancestors were pounding on each other with anything available, and bringing home neat stuff (like food and shiny rocks) to impress the females. Given that this behavioural pattern has existed for several hundred thousand years, is another three hundred going to make a difference?Given what is probably the entrenched, human genetic predisposition to meanness (It's not just the Klingons who have grumpy, negative emotion, limited anger control, DNA.), I don't think you can ever have a happy, big hug future, no matter how many replicated goods you throw at people, and, no matter how many senior Starfleet officer declarations about the Federation's high moral values, get stuffed down civilian throats. (Personally, I think they should have just blown Qo'noS to tiny bits.) And, the reverse of human nastiness is religion. I don't think ""facts"" have any real relevance to what you want passionately to believe. It's all Fake News, isn't it? Praying, and a sermon from a firebrand cleric, is always going to be more emotionally fulfilling than watching a documentary on the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation.Star Trek sometimes leaves me with the feeling that the future Earth must be a sort of high-tech version of middle America in the 1950's. Everything is just right. It's all good. We don't need dissent now, really, do we? The original Twilight Zone was actually made in the 1950's and early 1960's. Rod Serling's view of the future was that, no matter what, social class, prize fighting, miserable parts of New York City, cheap bars full of loser guys who can't get a date, authoritarian dictatorships, nasty, bigoted, little towns, and utterly horrid children will keep on trucking. In the one episode where they don't, people with seclusive, anti-social attitudes, are dealt with by massive doses of anti-depressants.And there's that one episode where the future Captain Kirk is having a nausea-inducing plane ride, and notices that there is some hairy-looking ape guy standing on the wing, making menacing gestures and seemingly looking to bring the plane down. Does Captain Kirk-to-be invite Mr. Hostile Apeman into the cabin for a respectful, intercultural exchange and negotiations? No! William Shatner whips out his handgun, illegally opens the emergency exit door, and resolves his alien air crash issues by filling Mr. Hairy and Gruesome full of lead. That, to me, is realism!But, Some Of It Is OKMost space-faring species being generally humanoid, and delineated just by particular facial bumps and projections? That could be real because of physics and biology. The human body plan is the way it is, at least because of the need to consume nutritional materials and have the minimal number of appendages, plus sensory organs, to identify objects around you and move them to different places. Bipedal walking is a pretty good way for a sentient species to move about. Having lots of extra limbs or tentacles means you have to find the additional nutritional resources to support a lot of extra nervous tissue.Warp drive possible? Even classical physics as it stands now, leaves open the doorway to it being theoretically possible.Lots of warp-capable species flying about? I don't take the Fermi-paradox too seriously. It is highly probable that Earth civilization isn't worthwhile enough for advanced aliens to bother contacting, or maybe the non-interference directive really is out there, in which case we are all extremely lucky. Also, some UFO visit evidence is awfully hard to refute. I suspect that they have been here, but that, accepting this is too frightening to deal with.And, everybody is fighting? If different species are warping, that means that they are operating in a common space. Unless the entire galaxy has been absorbed by the United States of America, most likely they will invent the phasers and photon torpedoes, and beat on each other. You can't replicate, entire, resource-rich, planets. You need to get out there and blast your opponents, in order to get your hands, or whatever appendages you have, on them.They Have Got Us ThereBeing old, I remember when cowboy shows and Howdie Doody were what you got. The film and TV industries saw science fiction as a bunch of non-commercial nonsense.Then, William Shatner jumped off that airplane wing, and became Captain Kirk. Maybe it is my Jewish-Canadian bias, but, without William Shatner and Leonard Nimoy, would science fiction have become the huge TV and film genre that it is now? And, it is not just about science fiction. The two actors created a vision of the future that is so positive and so encouraging, that enough of the general public wants science to create it. What if DARPA were to issue a release that, willy-nilly, they had discovered warp drive? Many of the now numerous science fiction fans, after jumping for joy, would know exactly what they would want to happen with it, that is, to boldly go where no man (OK, non-gender-defined person!) has gone before.I think Rod Serling also deserves a very honourable mention. Mostly, he depicted a future that most of us would not want, but, as science advanced, he made some of us think a lot about how not to get it.Martin LevineAre people from other countries enjoying the hostilities being waged between American Trump supporters and those opposing his presidency? What are your own opinions about America’s “Second Civil War.” Some say the first one never ended.August 7, 2018There are a lot of people in a lot of countries. Doubtless there are some that despise the USA, and like to see it in disunion. Of course, a foreign political leader might be pleased to see the USA weaken, so that their country can be more powerful in the world.This Question is almost three Questions. I am assuming that the second sentence might imply, how do foreigners see the supposed second Civil War? I presume, as well, that the third sentence asks, whether us foreigners believe the first Civil War never ended.I suppose the question could invite responses from Americans, about how they think, foreigners think, but also from foreigners about how they think, and how they think, other foreigners think.People In Other Countries May Have No Idea That The Civil War Happened And May Not Think Very Much About What Happens In The USA""People in other countries"" includes a whole lot of different people. My various travels to different countries, as a Canadian foreign service officer, taught me to accept something I could call ""the tyranny of the present and where you are"". Evidently the USA is a very powerful country, but, to the extent someone cares about anything to do with public affairs, the ones that effect things right around you, right now, tend to be the important ones. So, here I am, a resident of suburban Ottawa, with a government job downtown. I need the City of Ottawa to provide prompt, high quality snowplowing service after every one of Ottawa's numerous, heavy snowstorms. I need the local elementary schools to be good quality because I have two little kids. My spouse/partner drives to work but I take the bus. I need the bus service operated by the municipal OC Transpo to run, on time, without buses whipping past me at the bus stop, and throwing the abundant snow in my face, because they are full.Yes, I know Donald Trump and his base are out there, somewhere, but I have just spent a fair number of minutes reading local news and engaging in social media about the above. I may even have taken the time to compose and send an infuriated email to my local city counsellor, expressing my intense frustration that the bus didn't come on time this morning, and my view that someone else should have to pay a higher property tax assessment to get the bus service reliable, just not me. I have the NHL playoffs to watch now, not CNN and not FOX, which, I, conceivably, don't know exists.And, I live only an hour's drive from the United States border. (If you want to see Donald Trump's base, visit northern New York State, courageously defending America against us sly, evil, weak, backstabbing Canadian foreigners.) What about those real, heavy duty, foreign aliens, an ocean away? I have lived in New Delhi and Manila. I could tell you about some dire local problems, that exist, right now.Please Watch What You Call A WarMy Government of Canada travels took me to countries in the immediate aftermath of a war, blown-up buildings, mass graves, opposing militias who would just love the United Nations arranged truce to end, so that they can get back to shooting, raping, plundering and genociding each other.Some excessively emotional, not very knowledgeable, unempathetic people, shrieking on social media sites, or even on FOX (Yes, I, as a personal alien foreigner, admit that I know FOX exists. I have time to know that FOX exists because I live in downtown Ottawa and walk to work, and I don't have a spouse/partner or little kids.) is not any kind of a war. The current President making lengthy, rambling, emotive speeches, and 3:00 A.M. strange-sounding Tweets, with bizarre accusations against individuals, is not a civil war, either. The President is not making a civil war unless he persuades the military to attack Congress, and Bernie Sanders, Nancy Pelosi, et all, react by organizing a militia, or in, addition, organizing remaining parts of the military who want to remain loyal to the Constitution, or also organizing whole states, who want to fight back. Even if Donald Trump attempts to have only the most personally-loyal-to him Republicans, win the primaries, that is not a civil war either.None of this is Kosovo, or Bosnia, or bombed out buildings in Belgrade. It is an American something else and it has precedents. The McCarthy period was not a time of mutual love and trust among Americans. Richard Nixon was known to indulge in an occasional deception or two, and some of his staff felt that break-ins were an appropriate political technique. Bombing Cambodia and denying it, was about an international war, not a civil war in America. The American business oligarchic period, around the turn of the twentieth century, was not a Civil War.The multiplication of cable channels, and the coming to be of social media, has exaggerated the emotionalizing around these repeated events, but these events have been going on for a long time, and even before the real Civil War. I wish some perceptive political scientist, American or even foreign, would invent a term for these American events. ""Culture Wars"" doesn't quite contain all of them.Some years ago, an American historian named Richard J. Hofstadter, had an insightful article published, in Harper's Magazine, called ""The Paranoid Style in American Politics"". That's part of the definition, but only one aspect. What can I, the died in the wool, alien, foreigner suggest? Maybe, ""Socio-political, peculiarly American and not so infrequent, anger, fear, deception and disagreement, national spasms"". OK, that's really clunky, so I invite any Quoran who identifies with the American intelligentsia, or with the American unintelligentsia (both sides, not just the Alt Right), or even FOX, to invent a term with a better hook.Did The Civil War End?Yes, near the town of Appomattox Court House. The fact that it did not result in Southerners becoming proper Bostonians, is not a continuation of the grievous loss of life, blown up and burnt buildings, torn up railway tracks, horrible battlefield amputations, and prisoner of war death camps. The Confederate surrender did not resolve the multigenerational problems in the South, that were sure to continue. The United States is not the only country that has grievous, regionally originated, political and social issues that continue to fester, (Try Italy, try Spain, try the United Kingdom, at least for now.) without armed conflict.And, Donald Trump's base is far off being just Southern. The Rust Belt and the Midwest were not rebels in the Civil War. Looking from outside, the Old Confederacy almost seems like a bystander.The tyranny of the present and where you are, apply in the United States too. If you live in a Rust Belt region, and haven't seen a decent job appear, where those now-closed factories were, in the last thirty years, you are not looking to argue about states' rights. If you feel that America's elites, or most of Congress, couldn't care less about you, it is not that you want to participate in an armed rebellion. It is that you have really big personal problems that, were in part, caused by political and big business decisions that hurt your local community really badly, and you want rightful redress to be given to you, not an excuse to take up arms.Is Anybody Happy?Depending on what country you live in, and whether you are Vladimir Putin or somebody else, I don't think most of us foreigners are getting our jollies, watching chaotic and irresponsible political behaviour in America. If nothing else, if you do pay attention to stuff that happens in the USA, it is really irritating and distracting.I could offer Canada, now defined by the current American administration as a nasty foreign country, par excellence. We have a federal election coming on October 21, 2019. We would really like to spend our political time on having typically Canadian nice, civil, conciliatory, and frequently unproductive but, good subjects for national media commentators, debates about Canadian stuff. We would like to discuss our right now, our domestic issues, things that really matter, like persuading the provinces to accept common, national trucking highway standards, the good or profound evil of interprovincial beer sales (Big one, big one!), why the better-off provinces have to pay for the poorer ones, why so many Central Canadians despise Albertans, and how to make yet more excuses about the largely miserable situation of Canada's indigenous peoples, without spending any more money about it. Instead, the precious time. of our Prime Minister, and our provincial Premiers, is being wasted by accusations and threats slung from Donald Trump, his staff, his trade negotiators and his base. American domestic politics are wasting political time in other countries.And, its painful, but some of us foreigners admit it, we rely a lot on the United States being half-way coherent, even in its domestic behaviour. A lot of us foreigners would prefer an economically stabilized, viable and problem-solving America, no matter under what rules we trade with it. Congressional gridlock does not cause us joy, and the USA running up its national debt, does not make us feel cozy and secure.Despite the cries, and the complaints against us foreigners, which us FOX-aware aliens hear, we know that a strong American principle, not just a right-wing one, is that, we are special, we are exceptional, there is no foreign advice that has any value to us, although we will advise you. How would you expect us foreigners to feel?Some of us foreigners are even capable of empathy towards America's individual people, even if the Trump Administration is making us feel weary. We see so many Americans proclaiming ""My life is hard, I have no power over my what happens to me, bad, very influential, people are against me, everything is unfair, I fear the future."" Americans are proclaiming this very loudly, left and right both, and some of the proclamations get heard by at least some of us foreigners, right around the world. It is very saddening, particularly because we know that a lot of these complainers are good people, who deserve better.It's sad. It is pitiful. We do not understand how so many people can feel so low, when their country has the world's biggest economy, and a huge military, which ensures that no foreign power can successfully attack the USA. And, here is a human issue that transcends nationality, how can so many people be well-intentioned, willing to participate in a political process, and have access to information, but fear each other and just can't get things right? Will the same thing happen to us?Martin LevineIf we repealed NAFTA, would that actually bring back jobs to the US?August 1, 2018It doesn't seem like it would bring very many jobs back.Canada Is One Thing And Mexico Entirely AnotherPerhaps NAFTA itself was not an ideal approach for the United States, in terms of regulating its international trade relations with Canada and Mexico.MexicoAmerica's trade issues with Canada are quite different from those with Mexico. Mexico is a low wage country, and much of the USA's frustration with Mexican trade, centre around that. Surrounding any United States trade negotiations with Mexico, is American anger about undocumented immigration on its southern border. These issues have no relevance to trade with Canada.The NAFTA agreement made it cumbersome for the USA to negotiate with Mexico about the pressing issues between them. In the multilateral NAFTA deal, Canadian sign-off is required. Because a principle objective of the agreement is, no tariff barriers between the three countries, the USA is left with limited scope to apply special, separate tariffs against particular Mexican goods. Essentially, NAFTA grants Canada a veto power over any agreement that the USA and Mexico make, about their trade disputes and their problems.We see the problem right now. Two very important issues in the NAFTA negotiations are the American demand for a sunset clause and the American insistence on no independent, dispute resolution mechanism. Mexico may be willing to offer concessions on these issues but Canada, in all likelihood, will not. From the Canadian point of view they would reduce NAFTA to being nearly useless. Mexico and the USA will not get a Canadian sign-off on these concessions, even if both countries have agreed to it.CanadaCanada has wage levels approximately similar to the USA, depending upon the currency exchange rate at any given time. Despite the Trump Administration's nationalist approach to international trade, and President Trump's avowed dislike of multilateral trade agreements, the USA seems to be struggling to find things to dispute with Canada about. The USA is currently actually running a small surplus in its trade in goods and services with Canada, losing on goods but winning on services. Despite President Trump's expressed outrage about the Canadian dairy industry, withdrawing from NAFTA will not produce new jobs in the United States dairy sector. Canadian dairy exports to the USA are very small. Even if the United States withdrew from NAFTA, and banned all Canadian dairy products, this would have a negligible effect on the United States dairy industry. If the USA withdraws from NAFTA, Canada would have little or no reason to grant the American dairy industry additional access to Canada. Currently American dairy exports to Canada are five times higher than Canadian dairy exports to the USA.The other major industry, that the USA has identified as being a problem with Canada, is the trade in automobiles and auto parts. If, for the sake of argument, the USA withdrew from NAFTA, and banned the importation of all Canadian made cars and car parts, it isn't clear that the United States automotive industry would benefit very much. Subsidiaries of the big three American car companies build most of the cars that are manufactured in Canada and are exported to the USA. Those plants use a lot of American parts. The effect of banning Canadian-made cars would be to end the Canadian demand for those American parts. This, initially, could quite severely hurt the American auto industry.It is not clear when, or if, this ban would return auto and auto parts manufacturing to the USA. Canadian aluminum and steel are an important supply of materials for use in the construction of American cars. The Trump Administration has made it clear, that the primary purpose of imposing high tariffs on Canadian aluminum and steel, supposedly on national security grounds, was actually to practise ""linkage"" and force Canada to concede on other issues in the NAFTA negotiations. With no more NAFTA negotiations, what would the USA do about those tariffs? We are already seeing predictions that the tariffs will raise the cost of cars in the USA, and depress the American market for new cars. Eventually, American manufacturers might retool and expand in order to replace car parts and cars sourced from Canada. However, if the market for new cars is depressed by high materials costs, it might not be worth their while.In a no-NAFTA environment, would the USA end the tariffs on Canadian steel and aluminum, because there is no linkage left and nothing to negotiate about? In the case of aluminum, American production capacity is very run down. It would take years to build more smelters, plus the additional power generation capacity, for the enormous amount of electricity the smelters consume. Unless the United States Administration subsidizes the cost, private American companies would have to identify a business case to engage in these extremely costly, multiyear projects. Unless they have sufficient cash on hand, they would have to convince lenders and investors too. It isn't certain when, or if, new American jobs would materialize.The Old Canada-United States Free Trade Agreement Lurks In The BackgroundNormally, the cancellation of a free trade agreement between two or more countries, would cause their trade relations to revert back to regulation under the rules of the World Trade Organization. However, this is not the case for Canada and the USA. Before NAFTA there was the Canada-US Free Trade Agreement:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ca...NAFTA superseded this agreement but did not cancel it. The old agreement is still there, in a sort of slumber underneath NAFTA.There appear to be different views about what would happen to the old agreement, in the event of the cancellation of NAFTA. I have seen some suggestions that it would automatically reactivate, and again govern trade relations between the two countries, at least in the interim. However, the more common opinion seems to be that a vote in Congress would be necessary, to either reactivate it or to terminate it.So, the scenario is, Congress considers the matter. The Trump Administration may or may not see fit to make a recommendation. They could ask Congress to terminate the old agreement, unequivocally causing Canada-US trade to be governed by the WTO rules. Alternatively, they could seek Congressional authority to renegotiate it with Canada. In effect, this is asking Congress to let the old agreement return to being effective, at least in the interim. The United States negotiators would either force satisfactory concessions from Canada, or return with a recommendation that no satisfactory concessions can be obtained, and so the old deal should be cancelled.Congress has to ask itself, is terminating this old agreement worth it? There is still a good chance that the old agreement will allow trade between the USA and Canada to be balanced, or slightly in the favour of the United States. By then, without NAFTA, the US and Mexico may be in the process of negotiating a bilateral agreement, that satisfies American concerns about automobile manufacturing, and, some other issues that the USA deems important, about its trade and immigration relationships within North America. Perhaps it will have a border control component. The USA already has good control over its softwood lumber imports from Canada, which had been an ongoing, serious irritant. There is a risk that reverting to the WTO rules would strongly motivate Canadian exporters, and the Government of Canada, to try to ""detach"" from American markets and look for import-export opportunities elsewhere.Congress would need to face a basic reality, Canada will remain only a limited market for American goods, not because Canadians resist them, but because the Canadian economy and population just aren't very big. The population and economy of Canada is smaller in size than that of California.Canada buys a lot of machinery and materials from the USA already, particularly because domestic Canadian suppliers do not exist or cannot satisfy Canada's needs. However, there is a large part of Canadian market demand that the USA cannot compete in. That is, the market for small appliances, electronics, clothes and a lot of other consumer items. This is because, the capacity of the American economy to produce these goods has been eliminated. As a Canadian, I would have no problem with buying a toaster, or an HDTV, made in the USA, as opposed to one made in the People's Republic of China, but those products do not seem to exist.There is a good chance that Congress would conclude, that the Canada-US agreement is good enough. Both countries could agree on the need to update it. There isn't any other scenario where changes in trade with Canada would generate much more American jobs, or, maybe any more at all. Congress might vote to keep the old agreement, and not threaten Canada with cancellation. Trade discussions between members of Congress and Canadian governmental and private sector trading interests are already routine. Congress has plenty of means to engage Canada in discussions and negotiations about ongoing trade issues. Congress has other trade issues then Canada, and they are a lot more pressing.Take Your Trade Frustrations Where They Belong And Look At Your Own EconomyWhat if Americans were to prioritize their trade problems with other countries by order of magnitude? Canada would be low down. Mexico would be considerably more. The European Union and Japan are big markets, but they do not have low-wage advantages over America. However, there is still scope for some improvements that could be advantageous to American jobs.The Trump Administration has made it clear that America's big, big trade problems are with the People's Republic of China. Cancelling NAFTA won't help with this at all.The United States has another serious problem with the low-waged world, which is sort of like ""Whack-A-Mole"". Industries in the People's Republic of China are already showing signs of moving production to various other, lower-waged nations, for example, Vietnam, Thailand, India, Pakistan, etc. How many different countries can the US pursue in international trade negotiations, and what will the USA get?The USA might still get some concessions from the People's Republic of China, that might help America jobs in certain industries, such as, anti-dumping rules, elimination of non-tariff barriers, and respecting American intellectual property. This might in particular help the American steel industry and also industries where the USA has developed advanced expertise. But, there is no way to recover American jobs in manufacturing small appliances, electronics, clothes and some other consumer items. The People's Republic of China is not the only low-wage country out there.Another Answer pointed out that roboticization, for example, in the automotive industry, may eliminate any job gains that could come from eliminating foreign competition. The coal industry is being diminished, in part, by the increasing American production of natural gas and the potential for large and small-scale energy production via wind and solar power. Trade barriers will not cancel out inadequate educational standards for American workers, or dairy industry subsidies that cause overproduction, and drive smaller dairy farmers out of business.Was NAFTA A Mistake For America?The USA freely agreed to it, but maybe NAFTA could be seen as a mistake for the USA. It has complicated their efforts to resolve some serious issues with Mexico. In retrospect, perhaps it might have been better for the USA to continue the old Canada-USA Free Trade Agreement and then deal bilaterally with Mexico. The USA is very unlikely to get any new bilateral agreement with Canada, if it insists on a sunset clause, no independent dispute settlement mechanism and the abandonment of Canadian dairy supply management. Even if it did, it would not help American jobs very much.I have the feeling that Congress will have to resolve the NAFTA issues, perhaps in direct negotiations with Mexico and Canada. Congress is likely to be sensible and accept that the real detriments to American job growth are elsewhere. Congress has many things to deal with. They will want to wrap up the NAFTA issues and move on.Martin LevineIf Canada, Mexico, the EU and China became trade allies against the US, will the US survive in the trade war that Trump initiated?July 31, 2018What ""trade allies"" mean could use some definition. It isn't very likely that Canada, Mexico, the EU and China will create some sort of ""Take Down America"" agreement, and follow through with a bunch of bans against American products and services, punitive tariffs, bars on their nationals buying American services (including tourism in the USA), etc.It isn't in any case very likely, that any of these countries, not even China, do not want the USA to survive. The current American administration has taken an ""emphasize the negative"" approach to America's international trade. However, there is a lot of that trade that is not very controversial and where both sides see benefits. Also, the idea of ""trade"" that is circulating in the USA, does not encompass a lot of international economic activity that is not the exchange of goods, manufactured in one country. International investment goes on, including investment in hard infrastructure, such as factories. Businesses and governments from the various countries purchase each other's securities. The trade in intangible services goes on. And, some products and services get produced by a multinational effort, to the point where you cannot assign them to one country.Canada, Mexico, the EU and China do not have the same trading and international investment interests. Chinese trade practises, and its use of foreign investments for political and intelligence purposes, are of concern to these other countries as they are to the USA. Canada and Mexico do not have all same views on international trade as does the European Union. Various negotiations are going on, as these different countries and groups of countries try to reconcile their trade with each other, never mind the USA.While international trade is very important to the USA, trade problems will not bring the whole country down. The USA has a huge productive capacity, a lot of national resources, a huge internal market, and a lot of scientific and technological research and innovation capacity. None of this is going to dissolve altogether.International Trade Verges On Being A Distraction For AmericansCompared to some other public issues in the USA, it is easy to talk to Americans about the perils for America of international trade, America's trade ""enemies"", and, how American can ""defeat"" them.International trade, how tariffs and non-tariff barriers actually work, investments, security sales and product standards, are complex enough that, only a very well-informed specialist can fully understand the ""whole picture"". So, Donald Trump can make simplistic and emotive arguments to please his base and not get challenged. Commentators have no real way of responding in a concise and comprehensible way. It is quite understandable that Donald Trump uses foreign trade arguments to preserve his base and garner some support from the rest of the American electorate.However, what other ideological stances can Donald Trump market? He does not advocate for some of what traditionally have been seen as ""core"" Republican principles. He does not seem especially concerned about running up government deficits or increasing America's national debt. Given his lifestyle, he is not in a position to advocate for social conservatism or traditional American values about the family.Donald Trump has attempted to use undocumented immigration arrivals as a political club. However, he is not speaking to an issue that concerns some Republicans, should overall immigration to the USA be sharply cut in numbers? He has made it clear that he finds Mexicans to a large extent, distasteful. However, he is not elucidating a cultural programme for America, something to the effect of sharply restricting the use of any language but English. (For example, as in the Province of Quebec, banning and restricting signage in any language but the province's official one, French.) He does not appear to be an enthusiastic advocate of state's rights. He is not adverse to offering tax-payer supported subsidies for various purposes. He is certainly not a ""hawk"" on Russia. In fact, as a foreigner, I would have to ask Americans, what makes Donald Trump a Republican?When a politician campaigns on the basis of, ""Make America Great Again"", they are campaigning on an intangible. So far, the only discernable programmes that Donald Trump has offered in support of that goal, are to combat what he describes as trade abuse by foreign countries, and build a border wall. Donald Trump could not be described as a ""policy wonk"". It appears that he mostly just wants to get re-elected. He does not necessarily support Republican candidates, unless they are very loyal to him personally.Can Trade Distractions Bring Down America?It may be the case, that foreign trade issues for America, are turning into a distraction and a decoy. Resolving foreign trade grievances will not make America great again. A general ""win"" isn't possible, and would not so critically improve America's position that America's problems, or certainly not the problems of individual Americans, will be resolved. Whatever concessions the United States obtains, will only be a relative small component in resolving America's problems. The current American Administration's focus on foreign trade could turn into a future, severe detriment to America. This is partly because time trickles away and other, maybe more important problems, do not get underlined to the American public and do not get resolved. Some possible examples:-What can the United States Government do in the way of a focused, prioritized, deficit and debt reduction programme, with timelines?-As a major part of that, does the current United States Administration want to conduct a full review of America's expenditures on defence? Are they prepared to certify that all current expenditures are optimized to secure America's national defence?-Should an American Administration attempt to resolve the culture wars with legislation and or with constitutional amendments? This goes beyond simply a bland endorsement of family values. It could be by means of providing economic supports for the traditional, nuclear, married family (For example, paying a subsidy and offering tax concessions or enhanced housing grants and loans to families, married in the traditional sense, where the female parent stays home and provides full-time child care. Or, a constitutional amendment, that states that a homeowner is always entitled to own the defensive firearms of their choice and use them with lethal force, when anyone who might behave in a criminal way intrudes on their property.)-Given that this is a Republican Administration, should there be a federal legislative programme which would deter multiculturalism? This, for example, could be an Official Languages Act, including Quebec-type restrictions on any signage but in the official language. In addition, in the interests of national security, require states to take measures to assimilate immigrants and their children, and not accommodate them. So, for example, no town council meetings in any language other than English, no applications for services in any language but English, no government website, no brochures, in any language but English, and no heritage language education, in public or private schools.-Concerning America's struggling working class, should there be sunsetted, constantly audited, single purpose programmes for education, retraining and mobility to where the jobs are? Since this is a Republican administration, rather than expecting a bureaucracy to do them, you privatize them.I should stress that, I, as a foreigner, am not advocating for any of these measures. Were I an American I would strongly disagree with some of them. But, the USA is a very different country from Canada and, many Americans do see themselves as conservatives and want conservative solutions to problems. The Republican Party won the 2016 elections.America Crashes OutRecently, I have answered Quora Questions about the prospects for a British, Brexit ""crash out"", with no new trading agreements with the European Union. In Quora we have seen individual British people, and their media, express great anxiety about what would happen. And we see individual British people, very angry at each other. It does not appear, that the current Government of the United Kingdom, can negotiate any new agreement that will not cause a large part of Britain's population to feel embittered, betrayed and angry. As time passes, the odds of a crash out, with no agreement, are getting stronger.I am concerned that individual Americans and their media will consider it a crash out, when the Trump Administration's trade initiatives produce no new agreements, or agreements that do not come close to being the ""victory"" that Donald Trump has promised. Neither any of the agreements that the Trump Administration can hope to reach, nor a crash out, will make any American feel that the USA is on the way to being great again. Instead, because the Trump Administration has raised expectations so high, there is a bad risk that there will be feelings of betrayal, talk of conspiracies and secret deals, outrage, looking for scapegoats, etc.In the meantime, the Trump Administration will have lost some significant opportunities to really make international trade work better for the USA. They could have conducted negotiations to modernize NAFTA and treat it as a ""win-win"" opportunity, not a zero sum game. Rather than vague promises, it could possibly have secured a time table from the European Union to reduce all tariffs and co-ordinate product standards. Maybe it could have done something that would cause many Americans to feel America really is great again, that is, lead an international coalition on trade with China. These opportunities have been lost.In the meantime, resolving the other issues that I mention above, should have received more American attention than foreign trade, since the 2016 elections. By comparison, international trade negotiations ought to have been at the bottom of the list. Given the results of the 2016 elections, this would mean someone trying to carry out a traditional Republican platform.Looking at from outside, the USA sometimes appear to be anger-ridden country. The additional anger, from international trade negotiations that may end up looking to many Americans like a ""humiliation"", a ""failure"" ""deceit"" or a ""betrayal"", will spill right back through American society, including the House of Representatives and the Senate. The USA will survive but it will be further unable to make important decisions at the federal level. This means a weaker America, moving in the opposite direction from Great Again.Martin LevineWhat's your take on the recent rise of the alt-right politics and nationalism in the European Union?July 30, 2018I have lived in Austria and the United Kingdom, so I have at least a little experience with this region of the world.Obviously there is some of this going on, but, it is not clear how much the population of any given European country agrees with a sort of alt-right objective. In fact, ""alt-right"" is probably not the best term to describe some aspects of European politics. Those politics are not that driven by minimally-organized political extremists, screaming on the Internet. However, nationalism in Europe certainly is real.There are a lot of countries in the European Union. One thing I learned from living in the European Union, is that you can only extend the concept of ""Europe"" so far. The EU is made up of very distinct countries, each with their own languages, politics, internal resource limitations, etc. These various countries do not necessarily accept each other as ""brothers"", or even ""cousins"". Europe is full of old memories that die hard, or maybe just are not going to die no matter what.The European Union Is Not Fit For All The Purposes That Some Europeans Want It ForThere are various issues facing the countries of the European continent. The European Union was not created to cover all of them. The EU is primarily about structuring the international trade relations among its members. That role has advanced into addressing food and other product standards, the environment, regional economic development, the encouragement of scientific and technological research, etc.I think what has happened, is that this outward stretch of EU activities has gone about as far as it can legally go. Border security is still predominantly a national responsibility in the EU countries. The EU does not have a comprehensive mandate to develop one, ""European"" culture. NATO, rather than the EU, is the main military alliance in Europe. The European Union does not have a mandate to set immigration selection priorities for a united Europe, or to impose common standards for immigrant integration. However, these are some of the most fractious, frustrating and divisive issues in some European countries. The EU is not empowered to moderate and develop compromises for these issues, country by country. Also, despite its economic power, the EU has no authority to change the social class structure of each EU country. The social class relations in any EU country are meant to be ""givens"" that the EU should not question, but just work around.So, expectations get created in individual European countries, that the European Union cannot fill. This can cause the electorates of each country to wonder what the EU is really good for.Quasi Federal But Not That MuchThe European Union is a quasi-federal entity, not a real federation. However, it creates a phenomenon that we see a lot of Canada. The federal government behaves in a way that causes problems to download onto provincial and municipal administrations. Then, the federal government does quite a lot of handwashing regarding any negative consequences. Serious gaps in services, and serious budgetary problems arise.Currently, in the European Union countries, the issue in particular that really does drive nationalism and bursts of hard right political views, is migration. There is immigration from outside of the European Union and migration within. The immigration from outside issue seems to be one that the European Union sees as at the grey edge of its powers. From the top, there appears to be an informal bias towards, well, ""be nice to them"". So the expectation is that the EU countries ought to admit undocumented immigrants who enter EU waters by boat, or otherwise, and let them move freely, at least within single countries.The current federal government of Canada has a roughly similar policy, but more formally stated. However, it does not necessarily want to take charge of the results. In Canada, border control is exclusively a federal matter. Canada is currently receiving substantial numbers of asylum seekers who are trying to leave the United States, although nothing on the European scale. The federal policy is to admit them and let them move freely around Canada. Sooner or later, as resources are found, those asylum seekers will get their claims adjudicated, and then will be admitted for permanent residence here, or be asked to leave. However, in the potentially very lengthy meantime, how those asylum seekers survive, is a problem that the provincial and municipal governments are largely left to deal with. It is really expensive and drains resources away from other priorities. A lot of the asylum seekers settle initially in the Province of Ontario. The Government of Ontario has presented the federal government of Canada with a CAD$ 200,000,000 bill.The European Union policy is that asylum claimants should remain in the first EU country they arrive in. However, there is limited public confidence that this will be enforced. Further, how much can one expect from the south European countries where most of these asylum seekers land? Malta is tiny. Spain, Italy and Greece do not have the most vibrant economies in the EU. Their populations see the download and some become angry.Free migration of labour within the European Union is one of its four freedoms. This was not as much of an issue before the EU expanded to include a number of relatively poor, post-Communist, East European countries. Then, for some countries it became a bad, bad, nationalism driving issue. Without the intense resentment, that significant numbers of British people feel about migration from Poland, the Brexit referendum might not have passed. Eastern Europe has a large Romany population. Very unfortunately, their migration and their presence is resented by substantial numbers of people, in some European countries.Whatever polls are done, tend to indicate that Canadians are relatively tolerant of immigration, as long as it is tightly controlled and regulated, and, as long as immigrants are required to comply with a certain level of integration. The federal and provincial governments have elaborated and resourced programmes for that, and programmes for a modest, rather limited level of multiculturalism. In heavily-populated, socially stratified Europe, there is not as much scope for acceptance. National cultures are old and established. The European Union has not provided Canadian (Or Australian)-type selection, reconciliation and inclusion policies. They get the blame for unpopular immigration and do not provide solutions.Then, for some other issues, the European Union takes a stand of, ""Well, just put up with it."" Rather rigid social class structures, as well as rigid labour practices, remain and do not get that much challenged. The EU is not prepared to say that, even just economically, the British social class system is wrong. They only have a limited amount that they will say or do, about some regions within European countries remaining chronically depressed. EU regional development policies do not come close to compensating. Conversely, the European Union does not do all that much, about some of those regions in given EU countries being a permanent drain, on residents of better off regions within the same countries.Make Protracted Mistakes, Overreach and Under Reach And Get A Bad BacklashIt appears that anger about immigration is the main driver of nationalistic and extreme right-wing sentiment in much of the European Union. The European Union made and continues to make some serious mistakes about immigration, and it produces a backlash. Free movement of labour from the new EU countries was allowed much too quickly. ""Be nice"" does not work with border control, particularly when some European countries must pick up a huge bill and suffer labour market effects and infrastructural loading. The free movement of labour does not take into account the immigration issues that are particular to individual EU countries. Particularly, Great Britain is a heavily-populated island of limited size, with a locked in class structure and very limited tolerance of non-Commonwealth multiculturalism. The United Kingdom is an apple cart, that high levels of immigration will certainly upset.And, visibly taking the ""just put up with it"" stance does not work very well. Insisting that the European Union is good for every nation's economy, but tacitly saying, that social class structures, the cost of in-nation transfer payments from richer to poorer regions, and chronic regional underdevelopment, are of secondary importance to free trade in goods and services, and freedom of investment, sounds like hypocrisy and indifference to the problems of non-elite Europeans.Much of what the European Union is about, is complex economic arrangements, that in particular, give big, multinational European corporations maximum access to markets in a way that benefits them. The EU does not focus on popular democracy. The EU four freedoms system is not very flexible. It can override local problems and local sensitivities.There are various aspects of the European Union system that make local people in local places discontent. However, I think the failure of the EU to address migration issues, in a tenable and realistic way, has pushed the frustrations felt by people in some European Union nations, right over the top. I don't think we would have seen Brexit, anti-hijab laws, or the popularity of the Italian Five Star Movement, without these failures. The immigration problems have exacerbated the situation in some East European countries, where accepting liberal democracy is a shaky work in progress.Can The European Union Do Anything?The European Union needs to admit it has failed severely on migration issues. Its policy, of pressing some South European policies to own most of the responsibility for undocumented arrivals, is failing. The EU needs to accept, that there is a Europe-wide consensus, that Europe has only distinctly limited needs for immigration, and only limited ways to benefit from it, and recognize it in EU policy.It is too late to, again, restrict overall migration flows from poorer, East European countries. But, free movement of labour, no matter what, goes too far. Polish people are a very valuable part of the European fabric, but insisting that Britain should accept hundreds of thousands of Polish migrants, in a short period of time, was just unreasonable.The European Union governing structure is asking member countries to take an open and rather lenient stance to undocumented migration. Even a relatively immigration-tolerant, spacious country like Canada, would not accept the continued high level of undocumented arrivals that some EU countries are experiencing. Canada received one large boat arrival, some years ago, on its Pacific Coast. Canada put the passengers in a detention camp in a remote part of rural British Columbia.The European Union could badly use some clear statements about the problems being faced by working class European Union citizens, especially the ones trapped in chronically depressed regions. When the EU is actively pursuing a ""be nice"" strategy to asylum speakers, and to big European corporations, this absence is blaring. Sometimes free movement of goods and labour , and freedom of investment, backfire badly on weaker people in a country.Some people everywhere will always have far right views and over the top nationalism, but by action and inaction, the European Union has done a lot to stimulate those attitudes.Martin LevineHow useful are our tools for analyzing social, economic and political life, considering their failure to consistently predict or act upon key events such as the 2008 financial crisis or the recent rise of political polarization?July 26, 2018Not everybody has the same tools. Some of the better ones are costly, for example, paying an investment broker to manage your portfolio.Analysis doesn't tend to be all that effective, if all you have to work with is your native intelligence. Generally some training is needed. For example, some political science education is likely to be helpful if you want to analyze politics. The same for economics. But, above all, nobody can be an expert at everything.I am not suggesting that going to university is the only way to get some training. There is so much available on the Web, or in libraries, or on cable business, news and cultural channels.But, as another Answer said, some of the most important information, that would assist making educated predictions, is not made public. And, it is not all concealment and trickery. In Canada, a lot of the most important decisions occur in meetings of the federal Cabinet, which are, explicitly, highly secret. Some of these decisions have a very powerful impact, but we will not know what, if anything, was decided until a decision is announced. Not everything that went into that decision is going to be recorded in an accessible record, in part because some of the most powerful discussions are verbal and informal. We will not find out who was discussing with whom, about what, or how influential they were, or what cocktail party they went to, or who they had a posh expense account dinner with.It is really the same for private sector decisions. Corporations do not have to report all their own decision making or who their main influencers are. Concerning the 2008 recession, outsiders have little information about how competent corporate executives are. And, it is the same, in relatively democratic societies, for personal decisions. Polls can easily fail because the people who get polled do not wish to disclose details about themselves, their lifestyles or what they really think. They don't have to.There is another really important restriction on getting enough information to predict things, particularly things outside your personal life. It does not exist because it has not been gathered. For example, we see fearful questions in Quora about how dangerous ""multicultural"" immigration might be. But, we do not have very detailed information about how immigrants to Canada form their views and opinions, or what, if anything changes over time. To really get some good information you would need to do longitudinal studies. (In this context, it means going back periodically to the immigrant and asking them how they now view things, maybe six months, maybe one year, maybe two years, five years and ten years after arrival. Or, even ask their kids.) These types of studies can be very expensive (You would need a carefully selected, sizable number of immigrants or else your study could be effected by small sample size and random sample biases.) and politically sensitive, so not get funding, because you may find out facts that get reported in the media and badly upset a large part of the Canadian public.Instead, policy analysts and developers give advice to politicians using surrogate data, such as employment rates at various times after arrival, official language acquisition (There are two in Canada.) and the prevalence of terrorist incidents. But, this does not really answer the multicultural concerns that some people have. An immigrant can be fully employed, have a good working knowledge of English and French, not have any interest whatsoever in committing terrorist acts, but live in a complete silo, in an ethnic neighbourhood, declining to have anything but working relationships with people outside of their own ethnocultural group, despise some other religions and ethnicities, believe that people who consume alcohol and watch sports, instead of engaging in prayer and religious studies, are inferior, think feminism is false and wrong, etc. They simply know that there is little or nothing they can do about their general disagreement with Canadian society, other maybe than voting for candidates from their own ethnocultural group, or any politician who presents as being sufficiently social conservative.That Confirmation Bias Will Get YouWikipedia gives a rather detailed explanation of what ""confirmation bias"", means:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Co...If you have confirmation bias, you do not want to accept certain realities that you find very unpleasant. But, if you cannot accept them, not much is going to be left of your ability to predict things.Let me offer some confirmation biases of my own. I want to believe that people are fact-oriented, that they do not let their emotions get in the way of making decisions that are good ones in terms of their social class interests. I would like to believe that people are mostly driven by a strong desire to maintain and enhance the material interests of themselves and their loved ones. I want very much to believe that people see other aspects of their lives as optional and changeable and of inferior importance to making a living, making sure you have a dental plan and a good pension, etc. I want to believe that people will vote that way. I also want to believe that most people are at least a little bit empathetic. In other words my belief system is sort of typical of an older, urban-oriented, Jewish, half-queer, pseudo intellectual.But, maybe I am believing some nonsense and as a result, I have no way of coming close to making accurate economic, social and political predictions.A relative of mine back home in Winnipeg gave me an example of the prioritization decisions of a friend, which made me quite unhappy. My relative and the friend, both getting towards retirement, were talking about their jobs. The friend said that the main thing was that his job had paid for his season tickets to the Winnipeg Jets (Winnipeg's major league hockey team, which returned to the city after a lengthy absence, and which, if I could be allowed to contradict my own beliefs, has restored their pride of many Winnipeggers in their city.) How dare that friend think like that! How dare he not accept what I so wisely know, that your job is the primary meaning of your life, not some sports team that you drink beer and buy silly, overpriced souvenirs to!Pollsters can sometimes be a little bit like me. They are university-educated people doing a white collar job. If you cannot accept that certain beliefs that are held by a whole lot of not so necessarily highly-knowledgeable or sophisticated people, are critical to their lives, and how they act and vote politically, that poll is going to result in incorrect results.So, I can't get it that, for many Americans, their pride in being American, and their belief that the USA is the best country in every possible way, is critical to their self-esteem and gives them their optimism and motivation in life. They do not worry about the economy because they know that, as long as there is a President who believes in their values, he will use America's vast power to keep those aliens and unpatriotic, disloyal Americans, in their place. They know they have the right to bear arms and that any downside, like crime, can be resolved by supporting your local police. They know that their job is just a pay cheque anyhow and that what really matters is NASCAR and the NFL. They are not interested in contrary arguments from the media, because most of the media are just lies and fake news, put out by a bunch of New Yorkers who don't respect them.So, although I don't want to, I predict that it is quite possible that Donald Trump will win the 2020 election. People don't just ""wake-up"" and change their minds.How Much Can You Even Predict Your Own Personal Life?Someone once said that nothing is certain except death and taxes. I cannot see any reason why they could be wrong.It is much easier to predict your own personal life, if it has become stable. Life is even more predictable if you live in an order-oriented, social welfare state, like I do.I have heard it said. A career in the Canadian public service may be profoundly unsatisfying, but it is worth it, because, when you retire, you get full pharmaceutical and dental benefits, extended medical benefits and a rock-solid, defined benefits pension. Now that I am old and retired, I have great difficulty not agreeing. I agree in part because there are a lot of Canadians who do not have the superior-quality retirement benefits that I do. The remaining parts of their lives are unpredictable and potentially disastrous.Depending upon your attitude when you are younger, a large part of your personal life can be making the latter part of your life as predictable as it can be. Short of a nuclear war, global environmental catastrophes, or the invasion of Canada by space aliens or Donald Trump, life for me is relatively secure and predictable. The main variables, other than death and taxes, are the threat of losing ones' cognitive abilities and when you need to go in the Jewish Old Folks Home. Other changes are somewhat optional or controllable. Like, should I lose Ottawa and go home to Winnipeg, where apartments are substantially cheaper, the people are friendlier unless they are committing one of Winnipeg's relatively numerous criminal acts upon your person, and it's home, even although in January it is a suburb of Antarctica?But, what happens to the mill worker, in a one-industry lumber town? They have no real information about whether that plant might shut down, or the United States Department of Commerce decides that it hates your whole province. They do not have a shot at my secure public service retirement. Like those other old folks who don't have my relatively speaking retirement paradise, they do not really have any real way of predicting what the next day will bring. Their only real backstop is that they live in a social welfare state.Remember Star TrekI watch You Tube. What if NASA or some guy in the Midwest in his garage, invents Warp Drive? We have certainly seen the personal and social bulldozer effect of technology, from the 1950's right up to now.But I sooth myself. Despite the fact that the Enterprise has jumped out of my TV screen and really is there, parked in Iowa or flying around the cosmos, it is all good. The worst that can happen is that the Winnipeg Jewish Old Folks home has a Holodeck with an entertaining, wholesome and appropriate, Belorussian Ashkenazi Orthodox life in Bobroysk in 1840, programme.Hold on though! What if the Vulcans really do take a shine to us and teach us to live a healthy life until age 250? There's my wonderfully comatose retirement, out the window. The Government of Canada tells me, we are not going to pay you that very nice pension and benefits for the next 184 years. Back to your GOC work cubicle! Or even worse, my back to work, sucker, job, is now on the Enterprise. I can look forward to doing an entry level, night shift, sit there and watch the warp nacelles, job, until I retire again at age 220.So, in summary, when you make your predictions, remember that there are a whole lot of people who have motivations you don't want to think about, or, in managing an economy, haven't a clue what they are doing. And, be humble about those wild cards, the starship Enterprise suddenly rolls around the corner and parks outside, and Captain Kirk and Mr. Spock are going to take you for an extended, compulsory, ride in outer space.Martin LevineWhen will the era of global dominance by the USA end and why?July 24, 2018Did the USA ever have global dominance?It does not appear that there were any periods before World War II, when the United States was globally dominant. There was a period after World War II, when much of the British, European and Japanese economic infrastructure had been destroyed. The United States had a prosperous period when, relatively speaking, its economy was dominant. However this was before the era of United States participation in so many international trade agreements that so many Americans now find vexatious. Before these agreements, the American ability to dominate other economies was somewhat constrained.Then, there was the period after the fall of the Soviet Union. The United States was declared the world's only remaining superpower. However, did it achieve global dominance? It doesn't appear so.Dominating the World Is Really HardI should acknowledge what some other Questions in Quora forget. There is no evidence that the mass of the American population ever saw global domination as something they wanted to happen. Even before the current period of American trade anger began, the popular American narrative was about America being very vulnerable and in peril. This is a large part of what the American 1950's were about, the USA under immediate threat by clever Soviet plots from within the USA, to subvert the American way of life and make the USA a Communist puppet of the USSR. McCarthyism faded a little bit. But, from the 1960's to the late 1980's the dominant narrative was, Russia as an existential threat, followed, kind of far back, by the People's Republic of China.A Vulnerable USA Under ThreatMaybe that 1960's to 1980's narrative was a little bit right. The Soviet Union had rejected the concept of ""socialism in one country"". Looking at it in a factual sort of way, the Soviet Union did have a plan to ""bury"" the USA, as Nikita Khrushchev said. This consisted of gaining dominance in the developing world, by a mixture of supporting insurgencies, co-opting leaders who were hostile to the influence of the United States, foreign aid projects, bringing foreign students from the developing world to study in Russian universities, bribery, threats and propaganda. They were looking to win dominoes, according to the domino theory of Cold War relations. The Soviet Union built up a big nuclear arsenal, formidable ground and air forces, but not so much its navy. They caused countries that they somewhat controlled, such as Vietnam and Cuba, to participate in their planWhat was the preferred Soviet end game? Probably to ""take over"" the developing world and isolate the USA and Western Europe, with North Africa, the Middle East and Mexico under Soviet Control. Then, the coup de grace, via economic strangulation, forcing huge military expenditures by Western Europe and the USA, and by this means, demoralizing the United States and Western Europe (And Australia, Canada and New Zealand) into ""folding"".Until the Soviet Union came to a close, this threat was always there, although in its last few years, the Soviet Union and its Warsaw Pact regimes, were weakening and diminishing.But, Even After The End of the USSR, America Didn't DominateThere was euphoria after the end of the Soviet Union. There was the feeling that the USA had righteously won the Cold War, and that the Pax Americana would rule the world. That is all it was, euphoria. Why?During the domino era, the USA did not score victory over the USSR and did not come to dominate the developing world. There were some efforts to control individual developing countries. The USA installed the Shah of Iran. It invaded a few of the smaller countries, for example, Grenada and the Dominican Republic. But, much of the developing world essentially told the USA to take a hike. Neo-colonialism did not run in favour of the USA. The United Kingdom and France maintained their influence over much of their foreign empires,With the Soviet Union and its anti-religious influences dead, the reality, that a large part of the developing world's population are passionate believers in Islam, had a sort of rebound. These countries would not accept American ideas of democracy, human rights and freedom of religion, period. Most of these countries had entrenched elites, who preferred a type of protected crony capitalism and kleptocracy to American ideas about free enterprise. They would not permit free foreign investment and free trade with any country, and certainly not the USA. Islam provided an ideological basis to ""freeze out"" America.And, then, the reality that some countries in the developing world are really, really big in population. India, Indonesia, Pakistan, Brazil, even the Philippines. How do you gain control of them? They are too populous and too large in territory to invade. They are too big for American foreign aid projects to have anything beyond marginal influence. Their size makes them complex, with many competing politicians, ethnically-diverse populations and a variety of interest groups. There are not simply a few national influencers and leaders, who you can bribe or replace, so that you gain control of the whole country.The 1990s And OnThe end of the Soviet Union was not the end of Russia. Even after those parts of the Soviet Union that were not primarily of Russian ethnicity had left, Russia was still by far the most populous European or partially European country. It still had an enormous territorial extent and huge natural resources. The United States had not gained control of Russia.Prior to the end of the Cold War, the People's Republic of China was sort of the Threaten America little brother to the Soviet Union. However, since the end of the Cold War it has become more and more economically formidable and a major, major economic power. The USA never had control of mainland China and they certainly won't now.It is kind of interesting to consider the failure of the Manifest Destiny concept of the Western Hemisphere, that was popular in the USA around 1900. It didn't happen. Cuba sits there, a short distance from the USA, ostentatiously rejecting American influences and the American way of life. The USA failed to gain hegemony over Central and South America, even over the smaller, weaker countries. The Banana Republic model was not suitable for dominating the whole region.It is even the same in the Caribbean. The USA dominates its own territories there, but does not have complete control over Jamaica, the Dominican Republic, the Barbados, Trinidad and Tobago, etc. Even the American corporate community couldn't do it. They look to maximize their profits and reduce their costs. Trying to take control of even a smaller country is really expensive and may not yield enough profits to justify the cost. We have not seen any repetition of the Mafia-Batista model, which allowed US interests to dominate Cuba up until their revolution.Donald Trump Expands The Concept Of America In PerilPresident Trump's key message is that the USA is under a state of siege. Some of that siege comes from within, from bad news media and disloyal Democratic politicians. Some of it is from dangerous ethnocultural groups within the USA, and evil bureaucrats. However, in particular there is a dire threat to America from countries that were, supposedly, its friends, particularly the European Union and Canada. Mexico was never America's friend, but Donald Trump has augmented the Mexican threat dialogue, to include Mexico attacking the southern border of the USA and working assiduously to destroy America's economy. The People's Republic of China is a frightful, deliberate, economic threat, not just a military and political one.Generally, the Trump Administration has enhanced the dialogue about bad foreign countries, by reminding the American public that supposed friends are engaging in vicious economic plots against America. When Donald Trump says, ""Make America Great Again"", he is not suggesting that the USA currently has, or ever did have, global dominance. Then, there are still those unconquered developing countries out there, who President Trump has described in a rather pejorative manner.He almost sees the USA as a damsel, who he is saving from the railway tracks.The USA, Escaping From Being Globally DominatedThe USA has never been globally dominant. I think most of the American population knows that. If any of them thought that the USA could achieve global domination, I think the Korean War, Vietnam, Fidel Castro, Iraq, Afghanistan, Syria, the oil crisis of the 1970's, etc., convinced them that the USA couldn't. Donald Trump is simply reminding them of the economic part. Even then, the USA can't come close to global economic denomination. Rather, the USA is trying to protect its economy against the globe.And, I think that is more generally the long term theme. Certainly since the Second World War, the predominant American theme has been, preventing the rest of the world from dominating the USA. Underlying that theme, is the assumption that, the rest of the world has nothing at all that the United States ought, consensually to accept. Rather, beyond America's borders, the world is a mess of dangerous and or disorganized countries. Their populations are encouraged to believe wrong and evil things. Those countries seek to undermine the American way of life with illegal immigration and bad ideas. The seek to augment their military forces in preparation for an attack against the American homeland. They organize terrorist acts to intimidate the American population. Willfully, the more economically powerful ones are attempting to subvert the American economy, and make it subservient to foreign interests.Even as a foreign alien, I concede that the USA has real enemies. There are countries, whose governments seek to harm the USA. There are countries whose populations are just as nationalistic or more, and adopt a paranoid stance towards the USA. There are countries who engage in grossly unfair trade practises.What seems to plague Americans is, what do you do about it? Do you become as isolationist as you can possibly be, seek to isolate your economy from international influences, and make your conventional military forces even stronger? Do you put up with behaviour you do not like, from countries who ally with the USA in a way that is, however, generally useful to America? Do you compromise? Do you engage in formal agreements? On a selective basis, do you militarily attack countries that are publicly threatening the USA? Do you expend large amounts of money to maintain American military forces in bases overseas? What if America's relations with other countries enrich parts of the American population but beggar others?This is not the first time that so many Americans have been agitated about their external relations. The USA seems to go through cycles. Since the early 1950's it has been dire fear, then, our allies are with us, then, we have conquered our worst enemy but why we are we still not dominant, then, look at all our new enemies, then, is having allies worth it, and then, once again, dire fear.My Advice To Other Alien ForeignersIt is obvious that the USA is not seeking global domination. It is quite the reverse. A large part of their population is scared of the rest of the world. Reply with patience and understanding and do not make threatening moves. Remember that the USA is not all Hollywood and that many Americans are in dire economic shape. Remember that, like anywhere else, it is America's elites that do the real talking. Let other countries work on keeping adequate relations between themselves. Remember that many Americans really are fearful and let them work it out.Martin LevineWhat will be the eventual outcome of Mr. Trump's trade deals, trade wars, etc.?July 20, 2018No one can accurately predict the future. However there do seem to be some evolving trends.No Quick Resolution of AnythingThe painful Brexit negotiations are a reminder of how difficult and slow comprehensive trade negotiations are. The United Kingdom and the European Union have now been negotiating over a long period. It is about eight months from the Brexit date and very little has been resolved. If anything the negotiations seem to be heading towards paralysis.The Brexit negotiations illustrate a problem with comprehensive trade negotiations. The more comprehensive and complex the negotiations are, the more likelihood there is that there simply will not be an agreement. Then, you end up with a really bad predicament. In the case of Brexit, Britain may end up in the humiliating position of having to ""fold"" and ask the European Union to consider Britain's Article 50 declaration of withdrawal, null and void.In the absence of a negotiable agreement, the other alternative is the ""hard"" Brexit, ""crash-out"". I doubt that this will produce the overall calamity some anti-Brexiteers are predicting. (Some are predicting food shortages and dire shortages of pharmaceutical supplies.) Some sort of interim arrangements will be made for really essential types of trade, until border and port infrastructure to accommodate customs and product standard examinations and tariffs, just based on World Trade Organization rules, is built up. However it appears inevitable that there will be considerable disruptions, significant remigrations of people and the beginning of British job losses, as some firms leave Britain in order to stay within the European Union environment. The WTO rules were not designed to provide a guideway to the orderly dissolution of an economic union. There will certainly be confusion about how to unwind various aspects of British-European trade. This uncertainty will not help Britain's economic situation.You Don't Get Freedom and Independence For NothingIt is the same for Britain as for the United States. It is certainly true that bilateral and multilateral trade agreements constrain your country's freedom and independence, albeit on a consensual basis. Individual citizens might see the situation as a constraint on their personal liberty.However, renegotiated agreements, if you can get them, are still a constraint on your country's autonomy. Your country might, for a while, get more favourable terms of trade, but in the context of a binding overall agreement, new problems are bound to arise.So, if Brexit is too much of a burden on Britain's independence, or NAFTA is on that of the USA, the solution is to withdraw from them, and bear any costs as the price of freedom. The question that I have put to Americans before is, what would you prefer, cheap imported consumer goods from low-wage countries that destroy American jobs, or higher consumer prices and seeing working Americans thrive?""Crash Out"" of NAFTA?I am trying to think of a catchy way to describe the USA withdrawing from NAFTA, comparable to ""Brexit"". ""Naftexit"" maybe?This is what Donald Trump promised his base he would do. Instead he opted for renegotiations. It seems he thought that Canada and Mexico would very quickly fold, leaving him and his base with a proud, unqualified win. A lot of British Brexiteers did too. This strategy has failed. President Trump is now talking of making a bilateral agreement with Mexico, without addressing whether he would withdraw the United States from NAFTA. He says that he will not continue the NAFTA negotiations until after the mid-term elections. He sounds a little confused.Canadian politicians and the Canadian media have really discussed endlessly what to do in the event of an American NAFTA withdrawal, with no replacement, not even with two bilateral deals. Underneath the sometimes a little hysterical commentary, a couple of truths have emerged. One is that the USA has a right to withdraw without any other arrangements, and may do so, and Canada will get seriously hurt, at least in the short to medium term, and Canada will just have to deal with it. The other is, given the American demands in the NAFTA negotiations, it is very unlikely that a bilateral agreement, at all acceptable to Canada, could be arranged, so that won't help either.Mexico's new President-elect won't take office until December. This makes it unlikely that Mexico would be able to close a bilateral deal with the USA right away, presuming it wants it. I doubt they will. In the NAFTA negotiations, the USA has demanded that Mexico sharply raise its factory wages. There is the expectation that Mexico will do ""something"" to deter illegal border crossings. They won't.There is no question that Canada's economy will be badly hurt by the American termination of NAFTA, particularly Canada's automobile and auto parts industry. However, this sector of the Canadian economy isn't what it used to be. It couldn't withstand competition from Mexico or other low-waged countries.Much of what Canada exports to the USA is commodities, not so much consumer products, oil, aluminum, steel, uranium, softwood lumber. The USA is not self-sufficient in some of these commodities. There is also a lot of trade between the USA and Canada that is not controversial or an irritant. Tariffs under the World Trade Organization are already low. Trade will go on.Softwood lumber is a good example of a commodity-specific arrangement. It was left out of free trade. There is constant friction and recriminations to the WTO, but, the USA and Canada agree to quotas on how much softwood lumber Canada can ship to the USA. The trade goes on. It is highly likely that, for the handful of industries that are an irritant, similar arrangements would be worked out.In the meantime the Government of Canada has just now created a prominent new federal Cabinet role for a Minister of International Trade Diversification.https://pm.gc.ca/eng/news/2018/0...Personally, I wonder whether this may be the start of the Government of Canada throwing in the towel on NAFTA.Europe, China, the Others?The United Kingdom is in the process of learning the hard way what happens when you mess with the European Union. Britain simply is not powerful enough to force a deal on favourable terms.Neither is the USA. Trade with the USA is important to the EU but not absolutely important. The European Union has a very big internal market for its goods and services. Their trade negotiators are very seasoned. Just a few days ago the EU completed a trade deal with Japan. They have a tentative one with Canada. They will continue looking for other deals and will be very aware of markets that the USA is in the process of losing, and that they can pick up.What about predictions that the EU will disintegrate? If the United Kingdom cannot get an adequate separation deal, what can smaller and economically weaker countries do? Some of the high unemployment countries of the EU avoid a lot of unrest because their workers can freely take up work in the better off ones. The poorer countries get subsidies from the richer ones. The UK has always been the one country in the EU where many of its citizens reject the concept of ""Europeanness"". The other EU countries do not have this issue, apparently not even the Republic of Ireland.China is a huge country both in population and territory. It is also an authoritarian one. The Government of the People's Republic of China has ample means to suppress individuals and groups, who would suggest that China is so desperate, that it must accommodate the USA. Their relationship with the USA has never been a good one. The Government of the People's Republic has plenty of media control to whip up anger against the USA, and propagandize the Chinese people into accepting some privation, in order to keep China free of the USA. The USA cannot win an all-in, all or nothing, finger-pointing trade game trade with China. The People's Republic of China is the source of a large part of all the cheap consumer goods that get sold in the USA. I mention it above, but my guess is that no American Administration would have the courage to tell American consumers to do without them. In the meantime, China will pursue its Silk Road trade initiative, and undermine the USA.Us Aliens Will WaitThe mid-terms are approaching. The Trump Administration continue to dig itself into unnecessary deep trouble. Vladimir Putin big hugs are superfluous. The Mueller investigation continues. And, Donald Trump keeps on getting into trouble with his former girlfriends.Yes, some Republic legislators are slavish to the point of cowardice. But Donald Trump's credibility continues to erode with all but his base. The damage the USA imposed on itself, with its aluminum and steel tariffs, continues to worsen. The Chinese market for American soybeans and pork is on the verge of collapse. The European Union, China, Mexico, Canada, Turkey, India and others are taking reprisals, some of them against congressional districts where a large part of Donald Trump's base lives. We will see how well that base is doing next January and how much authority is left to Donald Trump to do much of anything.The Likely Result?Congress, even most of the Republicans, may decide that they need to reassume their constitutional responsibility for international trade. Enough of Donald Trump's base has learned that, as much as they adore the man, there is no big trade win out there and the potential for lots more hurt. American trade negotiators, carrying out the will of Congress, return America's trade negotiations to being just negotiations, with no drama, no expectation of triumph, more compromises, and a much lower profile.Or, Donald Trump retains enough power to carry on the trade drama show. Chances are that Canada, Mexico, China and the European Union will walk away, work on more international trade diversification, with the requisite international agreements, and sideline the USA. Even a country as reliant on US trade as Canada, accepts the reality, takes the hit and works just as hard as it can to move on. Jobs for the American working class and American farmers slide away. The USA experiences spot shortages of certain key commodities.The WTO rules are adequate enough to cover a lot of the world's international trade, so trade does not stop. The American economy weakens, there is more unemployment, and growth slows, but the USA continues to trade. However, the European Union and China squeeze from both sides, and the USA is not the dominant power in world trade that it was before.Martin LevineWhy has liberalism become more associated with the elite in recent years?July 18, 2018“Liberalism"" doesn't really have any firm definition. Other Answers have pointed out that ""liberalism"" used to describe a philosophy that some nowadays might describe as conservative, an adherence to free market principles and maybe some Libertarianism.However, in the context of this question, I presume that liberalism means a desire to create and maintain a country where governments believe in social programming, the redistribution of wealth, plentiful government regulation of the economy, a very strong emphasis on minority rights and affirmative action, a rejection of the validity of religious and traditional influences (That is, strong secularism.), a willingness to subsidize activities that governments see as a benefit to society and strict equality of all lifestyle groups, with no references to ""tradition"", ""heritage"", etc.However, this type of liberalism is still capitalism and free-enterprise oriented. It isn't socialism or communism. Liberalism is really capitalism mitigated by a social safety net. There is no particular reason for a capitalist country to require racism, religion, traditionalism or intense heritage orientation. All of these could actually compromise the capitalist objective of forcing human labour to its highest possible level of productivity.Liberalism doesn't seem to dictate how a country ought to run its international affairs. Liberalism isn't pro or anti free trade. It is necessarily for or against multilateral trade agreements. It isn't pacifist. Liberalism does not necessarily forestall taking an isolationist approach to your country's international affairs.Notably, there is no standard liberal approach to immigration or how undocumented immigration is deterred. Liberalism does not necessarily equate to open borders or amnesties.What Happens When Liberalism Has No Political Party?Canada has a set of political parties called Liberal parties. The Liberal Party of Canada is the federal party and is currently the governing party at the federal level in Canada. The Liberal Party of Canada presents what it sees as a liberal political platform and set of programmes.Most of the provinces have Liberal Parties that seek to elect members to the provincial legislatures and hopefully, win a majority so as to become the governing party of the province. Currently five of the ten provinces have Liberal Party governments. These five governments all have political philosophies that are roughly comparable to those of the Liberal Party of Canada, with regard to matters that are within the provincial sphere of authority. British Columbia has a Liberal Party that, until recently, was the government of that province. However that Liberal Party is more of conservative party, maybe a bit more like the older type of liberalism.But, the United States does not have a Liberal Party, not at the federal level and as far as I know (Please correct me, Americans.), not at the state level either.I maintain that the Democratic Party, neither at the federal or at the state level, is not a liberal party, and hasn't held itself out as such. The United States only has two major parties at either the federal or state level. As I understand it, in the USA, there are legal constraints that make it quite difficult to form third parties. If there can only be two major political parties, then they both have to be ""grab bags"" for various interests and views.Third parties are much easier to operate in Canada and drain off a lot of the grab bag. The two major parties in the federal Parliament of Canada, are the Liberal Party of Canada and the Conservative Party of Canada. However, one of the reasons for the success of the Liberal Party of Canada is that, to the left of them, in the federal Parliament, there is the New Democratic Party, which avowedly is social democratic and socialist in character. That means that a Canadian voter who strongly believes in free enterprise and private property, but likes the idea of a comprehensive social safety net and strict equality and equity between all social groups, can vote Liberal and not compromise their own core beliefs.There is also a Green Party at the federal and some provincial levels, for Canadian voters who would like to focus above all on the environment. In the federal Parliament, Quebec has the Bloc Québécois, which, in principal, support's Quebec's departure from Canada but, in the interim, seeks to maximize the benefits for Quebec while it is still in Canada.By contrast, who constitutes the supporters and elected politicians of the federal or state Democratic Parties in the USA? To the extent it has a discernable programme, the Democratic Party is pro-capitalist and pro-free enterprise. It is friendly to some social programming but not necessarily all that much more so than the Republicans. (Even Donald Trump has not attempted to end social security, food stamps, Medicare, veteran's benefits or state welfare. President Trump doesn't even advocate scrapping Obamacare altogether, until he can agree with Congress on what he sees as a superior replacement.)The Democratic Party is just as dependent on big business as the Republican Party. They accept that big business can influence them and lobby them.Looking at it from the point of view of an outside alien, what differences would I say are the most significant between the federal and some state Democratic and Republican Parties?Democratic Party-The Democratic Party advocates a lot for ethnic, racial and lifestyle minority groups. They are generally supportive of feminism. They favour only limited religious, traditionalist and heritage influence on public morality. They endorse equity and affirmative action strategies. They tend to believe that political correctness is good for America.-They are somewhat open border and immigration amnesty oriented.-They do not feel much sympathy for Caucasian, working class and rural Americans. Rather, they tend to see them as part of America's problems. The Democratic Party is urban oriented. It seeks to end traditionalist and heritage justifications for certain situations in the USA and replace them with a secular, urban-oriented perspective.-Notably, the Democratic Party leadership, as a whole, does, not endorse the policies of Bernie Sanders, who is generally in favour of increased social programming and aid to the working class, and to a certain extent, is what one might call a modern liberal.Republicans-The Republican Party is generally opposed to what they view as excessive emphasis on affirmative action and equity programming.-They believe that religious, traditionalist and heritage values are very important to the well-being of the USA. They strongly endorse public displays of patriotism.-Some of them are very concerned about the growth of federal and state debt in America.-To some extent, they believe that decision making on a range of issues should be left to the discretion of the state governments and not federalized.-Currently, many Republicans feel that the United States is not being treated appropriately and is paying more than its fair share of the costs in various multilateral agreements the United States has entered into. They believe these agreements must be renegotiated.-Notably, while the Republican Party has received a considerable number of participants with racist, religious-based and anti-feminist views, the Republican Party can only go as far as endorsing patriotism and a focus on the importance of the traditional family.No Liberal-Conservative, Then You Get Strongly Elitist PartiesThe differences I describe above are not liberal-conservative ones in the traditional sense. The differences are more about cultural stances, personal feelings about different ethnic, racial and lifestyle groups and feelings about what public cultural displays are good for America. They are feelings about budgets and about the distribution of decision-making between the federal and state governments. The differences are also a commentary on who are the good and bad influencers in America. Some Republicans might say that the Hollywood elite are bad, immoral influencers. Some Democrats might say the same about the evangelical churches.I would agree that both of the large parties in the federal Parliament of Canada are dominated by core elites. However, these elites have chosen to identify themselves with entire platforms, that could be described as moderately liberal or moderately conservative. They are willing to permit a limited discussion by the general membership about the platforms.So, you could be a run of the mill Canadian, and join the Liberal or Conservative federal or provincial parties. You could be selected as a delegate to a policy convention. You might be granted permission to dialogue with the party leader or senior party officials about the platform and programmes of the party, at a focus group or a town hall meeting. You might be allowed to participate in nomination procedures for your party's candidate, even questioning them about various issues. If you submit a respectful email or brief to your party's local Member of Parliament, or the party leadership, it will not annoy them. The Party may be receptive to grassroots descriptions of problems or suggestions that may have merit in terms of garnering votes. As long as your views are not inimical to those of the elites or prominent individuals within the party, they might even be considered. The Party might be interested in elevating promising young people who can do a policy and budget analysis, have good self-presentation skills and might eventually be good nominees for the federal or provincial Parliament.But what does a non-elite liberal do when there is no party in their country that is a liberal party? It might be more appropriate to say that the United States has various prominent individuals or groups, who have some views that could be described as part of a liberal platform. Perhaps Bernie Sanders is as close as there currently is to an all-around American liberal. Then there are Hollywood advocates of respect for lifestyle minorities. There are groups that advocate equity and affirmative action strategies. There are groups that advocate for specific social programmes. There are groups that advocate for ethnocultural multiculturalism and reject traditionalist and religious-based arguments about what is good for America.But, what groups are there that argue for the ideological ""purification"" of the Democratic Party, so that it firmly rejects the excessive influence of corporate elites and specifically declares itself the liberal party of social programming, of ethnic and gender parity, the party of the working class and unions, the party that wants to expel religious and traditionalist influences from American public life, and has a specific platform about how to do it all?Instead, that grassroots liberal will be confronted by a very corporate, elitist Democratic Party leadership that do not pretend to be all around liberals. The grassroots liberal could try to argue with the Democratic Party elites. They could try to influence groups and prominent individuals who advocate for ""bits"" of liberalism. Maybe that would be worth it, but each of the groups has elites and celebrities. Convincing the leaders of one group does not mean that you have convinced the leaders of any other.With no Liberal Party as such, there is no chance of advocating for one liberal, American political platform and set of programmes. Instead, the grassroots liberal ends up struggling with corporate-oriented elites and other elites of various kinds.Martin LevineIs the concept of the American 'melting pot' inherently 'racist' and outdated?July 16, 2018Is America Really a ""Melting Pot""?An ideology can be far off being a reality. Also, there isn't one common definition of ""Melting Pot"". If Melting Pot means a situation where immigrants and their children are so totally absorbed into a fixed, homogenous mainstream that nothing is left of their heritage culture, than the United States is not a Melting Pot.I rush to say, that this is not a Canadian making more dismissive statements about the USA. Canada has an opposing Mosaic theory, where immigrants and their descendants are encouraged (or maybe forced) to maintain elements of their heritage culture, in the context of a harmonious Canadian whole. This is just as much a disconnect, with a tenuous relationship with Canadian reality. If anything, Mosaic has the higher potential to damage the rights and equality of individual Canadians, than Melting Pot has the same risk for individual Americans.Racist?The USA still receives a substantial number of Caucasian immigrants. Unless one is applying an idiosyncratic interpretation of ""race"", racism would not apply to this group of people.Even if one is a person of colour, there is an individual, non-forced, selective component to how one integrates and how one prefers one's children be integrated.We see it in Canada. Skin colour is not synonymous with culture and values. For example, you are an immigrant of South Korean origin in Vancouver. Like many South Korean immigrants to Canada, you are a practising Christian. Not infrequently, a Korean-oriented congregation, of a given church already represented here, will make arrangements to use an existing church while the Canadian-born congregations still does. Often this helps that church survive, where the Canadian born congregation has been shrinking. I believe the same happens in the USA.So here we have it, an immigrant with Korean facial features who understands that they and their children must learn English in order to thrive in America. Their value system is based on a church that is already well-represented and well-regarded amongst native-born Americans. They come from a country where democracy was painfully built up after the end of the post-Korean War dictatorship. They probably take democracy less for granted then some native-born Americans do. If they wished, they could still send their children for supplemental Korean language training. The children's grandparents might visit America and teach the children something of their Korean heritage. Perhaps they purchase a Korean-language channel from their satellite provider. They use the channel to watch K-Pop and recent films from the Korean cinema, not to get politically worked up about political issues in South Korea.And then we have the numerous Filipino immigrants to the USA and Canada, mostly English-speaking Roman Catholics. They might like to make the occasional trip back to the Philippines with their Pasabulongs (Gifts that expat Filipinos are traditionally expected to bring back to family and friends in the Philippines.) Also, they might enjoy a satellite channel in Tagalog, Ilocano or Cebuano. Otherwise they seem to feel rather comfortable in Winnipeg and Seattle.This type of situation is very representative of what happens to immigrants and their kids in the USA and Canada. There is a lot of expressed concern about immigrants of the Muslim faith who supposedly ""refuse to integrate"" and determinedly harbour anti-democratic values. There is little evidence that most Muslim immigrants to the USA or Canada feel that way or that they want their children to. And then, there are the large number of immigrants whose religious heritages are not deemed antithetical to Canadian or American values, Hindus, Sikhs, members of the Buddhist faith, Taoists, Baha'is, etc.Racism is always a danger. However, in relatively democratic, commercial-oriented countries like the USA or Canada, immigrants of colour do not have their religious, cultural or values heritage compulsorily stripped away at the port of entry. They can have that cable channel, they can join a folk-dance group, they can have a heritage language church, mosque, synagogue or temple congregation. They are allowed to freely attend delicatessens. They are permitted to have banquet halls and cemeteries that cater to their own group and observe various dietary laws there. If Grandpa or Grandma visit and tell their grandchildren some stories about the Old Country, it is permitted.Perhaps a small extract from Canadian history might help to put the racist argument in context. By the mid 1960's English-speaking Canada had become a very mixed country in terms of national origins. But, the diversity was a result of Caucasian immigration from various European countries, the Ukraine, Poland, Hungary, Iceland, Norway, Denmark, Sweden, Finland, Russia, Germany, Italy, Portugal, Greece, Malta. Non-British, European immigration had started in a big way in the 1890's. For decades, more fearful old stock Canadians had tried to define this diverse immigration as a threat. They insisted that Ruthenians, Italians, Greeks, and even Germans, were different from the British race. But, after decades, they had to concede, examining the facial features of a Canadian-born Caucasian, and determining with confidence whether they were Ukrainian or Scottish, was a delusion. Then, these folks won medals in World War II and ran for Parliament, in English. To this day there are still the banquet halls, the cemeteries, the delicatessens, the satellite channels. but, Canada has outrun the racial component of this basic reality.For America, were Bobby Vinton, Frank Sinatra, Dean Martin, Danny Thomas, Jerry Lewis, etc., a racial issue? What about J. Lo and Kim Kardashian?Outdated?""Melting Pot"" and ""Mosaic"" are ideological statements about how immigrants to a given country, and their descendants, make their peace with their new home. As long as people are permitted to migrate permanently from one country to another, this issue will never get outdated.You can almost call it a hierarchy of needs and wants.Tier One- This is the ""Yes, you will!"" part of the Melting Pot. You and your kids need to continue eating in your new place of residence. Unless you are loaded, this means that you have to integrate enough to get a job.You would probably like to stay out of jail. Your kids need some type of education. If they grow up and meet another grown up kid, they might need a legal way in that country to get married, presuming they still believe in marriage anymore. Maybe you would like to fulfill that immigrant dream and buy your own home. Again, unless you or some generous person in your family is very well-fixed, you need a locally approved way to get a mortgage and register a land title. If you want to buy and run a vehicle, despite your cultural pride, you will have to submit to your state Department of Motor Vehicles. (In English-speaking Canada, we like to use the hoitsy-British term, Provincial Ministry of Transport.) If you are really lucky they might have a driver training manual in your heritage language.So this, more or less is a high level Melting Pot that still is imposed upon the immigrant and their descendants, even if they are non-controversially Caucasian.Tier Two-Then moving, down, you get into a quasi-melted integration Twilight Zone region. Or, you could call it the Fondue Zone. What about that satellite channel? What about that heritage language worship congregation? Are you prepared to take the big step, and wear national costume to a wedding or your chosen place of worship? Will you tolerate your children learning nasty words in your heritage tongue? Do you feel comfortable with letting them watch back-home firebrands on the satellite channel you paid for, to watch those films, videos and variety channels, not them? What about cracking jokes about other ethnocultural groups that, on a heritage basis, you don't like, just not in the workplace or anywhere else that might trigger massive reprisals? What about letting them or not letting them watch real American pop videos that sort of reflect contemporary All-American youth values, with Bruno Mars and Rihanna. (OK, she didn't start out by being a staple of modern American pop culture but she came to America and poured some Barbados into the Melting Pot.) You can do these things if you want to. You can get away with it.Tier Three-Then, you get into the opposite end of the Melting Pot, the ""No, you won't!"" as compared to Tier 1, ""Yes you will, whether you want to or not"". That is, no you won't practise marital customs that we don't like, not even in Utah No, you will not burn the Stars and Stripes on someone else's private property, like major league baseball parks. No, we don't care what your religious principles are, when it includes sending funds to overseas terror groups, or worse, begging them to do stuff here, no, you won't. No, you will not be saying inappropriate things to female workers in your workplace. No, we are not going to make your heritage language an official one here. Yes, you can have a heritage-oriented private school, but also yes, you will teach the state or provincial curriculum there, your teachers have to be licenced according to our standards, and, if they say nasty things to the kids, we will prosecute them heritage or not.So, It Is Not About Race or OutdatedThis is in part because the ""Melting Pot"" never existed in an illusory, absolute, one size fits all sense. Tier One and Tier Three melting is still in effect, both in the USA and even in social big hug Canada.But then there is that broad, allowed Tier Two. As I said, in Canada, racial fantasies were employed for the longest time against it. However, particularly when it was being applied mostly against fellow Caucasians whose Moms and Dads happened to be from elsewhere, the resistance to it started to appear plain dumb, and also illegal.Given the countries they are, neither the USA nor Canada can stop that, not so melted, we add to the cultural fondue and no, we don't care what you think about it, zone.So, the Melting Pot, at least in parts, won't stop. Nor, will the Fondue Pot. And racism is just plain racism, in the United States or In Canada. The Melting Pot was not about the race of immigrants. It was about their culture and how much of it either country would let them pass on to their kids.Martin LevineWhat was wrong about Trump’s suggestion that all nations end all tariffs and trade freely? If you support tariffs, why should the US allow other nations to impose higher tariffs on us than we do on them?July 13, 2018It's Not Just TariffsIt's important to remember that tariffs are not the only trade barriers in the world. There are plenty of non-tariff barriers. Then there are absolute bars on entry of goods from some countries. This can be because of a trade reprisal but there are other reasons, such as failure to comply with national product standards, safety, environmental issues, etc.ServicesAlso, it is really important to remember that much of world trade nowadays is trade in services, not just goods. The service trade can take various formats. If I, the Canadian, go for a holiday in Fort Lauderdale, that is international trade in services, in favour of the USA. It would be the same if I attended a university in the USA, or took an online course from a university in the USA. Or, if a consultant from one country is permitted to go to some other country and provide consulting services, that is international trade in services. Or, the consultant could be providing the service on line, from home, and that is still international trade in services.This international trade in services has become huge. Some developed countries have economies that produce more services than goods. Despite all the disputes about steel, aluminum and milk, modern Canada is more of a service economy than a goods-producing one.They Won't Buy It AnyhowAnd, here is another really significant trade issue. A given country, or group of countries can say, ""Sure, we will let your products in duty free!"". Meanwhile, they know that your goods will be difficult to sell, because of local preferences or local nationalism. Having lived in Europe, I know that American cars don't have that great of a reputation. Ford would have a very difficult time, trying to compete head on against Mercedes, BMW, Audi, Volkswagen, etc. Also, you would need a huge bricks and mortar investment in dealers and repair shops, unless you could convince local dealers to sell your cars. That friendly sounding country knows that.What Do You Do About Wages?The shelves of the big box stores of America are lined with cheap goods from overseas. Why are they so cheap? To a large extent they are made in countries with really low wages. Wages in the People's Republic of China, Thailand, Bangladesh, India, Mexico, etc., are a fraction of even the minimum wages of the USA. Those goods are not on American store shelves because of low tariffs.And, Exchange Rates and Union Scale?Let's talk about a big type of service, that is, film and TV production. So many of America's favourite films and TV shows are made in Vancouver, British Columbia. Lower that Maple Leaf flag. Run up the Stars and Stripes. Drag in some US Postal type mailboxes. Tell your local extras to dress and act American. The ones with vocal roles might get a speaking coach to help them sound less Canadian neutral and more American. Then, you have got your pseudo Seattle or pseudo-Portland, Oregon.Potentially, the USA is losing millions of dollars in film and TV production. British Columbia has union pay rates, but they are cheaper than Hollywood's. Also, the Canadian dollar is only worth about 76 American cents. The American producers get a made-in-Canada bargain.Damn Those Subsidies and Special Breaks!Canada and its provinces subsidize various industries and give them various sorts of breaks. So does the USA and its states. So do lots of countries.A subsidy can manifest itself in various ways, money you get from the government and money you don't have to pay to the government. The subsidy could be an outright government payment per job created. It could be a concession on corporate income taxes. It could be a rebate on goods and services purchased locally. It could be a municipality excusing you from property tax or paying taxpayer money to train your workers.In Canada there is a particular type of break that Donald Trump hates. We have provincial agricultural marketing boards. We call it supply management. You can't produce milk, eggs, etc. unless you get a licence and a quota. Enough product gets produced for the Canadian market but not much more.Totally unfair to American farmers, yes? Hold on a minute. Supply management means managing production to meet domestic Canadian demand, and not much more. Canada doesn't seek to become a big exporter of these goods. That means, Canada doesn't challenge high-producing American farms for external markets, or producers anywhere else. Canada has lots of pasture and lots of room for more chicken farms. Don't worry, the farmers of Wisconsin, Canada won't use it.We Aren't Trading, SorryThat dairy supply management thing again. Donald Trump getting red in the face about the Manitoba Milk Marketing Board.As I said recently, free trade agreements are not free trade agreements. They aren't the same as an economic union. In NAFTA, the USA negotiators accepted it. Canada doesn't want a whole lot of international trade in dairy goods. The USA and Canada negotiated small export quotas to each other. Canada gave in on other stuff too.So, no, Canada does not charge a 270% tax on all dairy imports from the USA. There is no tariff at all on American milk within the quota. The Canadian tariffs kick in when American dairy imports run over quota. Remember, Canada deliberately favours security for dairy farmers over low-cost milk for the consumer. Foreign yes? But Canada is a foreign country.We Won't Get It At Your PriceUnder NAFTA, most American-made goods enter Canada tariff free and no quotas.However, we don't get to buy your stuff at your price. Canadian taxes on wholesalers and distributors can be high. So are retail sales taxes. So are transportation costs in a huge, thinly-populated country. And, there isn't all that much retail competition here. (Small populations mean fewer retailers.) Retailers get to charge more. And, the Canadian dollar is worth about 76 American cents. By the time those American goods hit the Canadian retailer, they aren't cheap.That Good Old WTOMost of the countries of the world participate in the World Trade Organization (WTO). The WTO has been working for years to get tariffs down. Most developed countries have low tariffs on most things. But how about the developing countries? A lot of what they produce for their own markets is not cheap. Some of these countries rely on small, not very efficient, peasant farmers, millions of them. Unless they are producing for export, local factories tend to be small, underinvested and with short production runs. That costs. Tariff free access to markets like that is going to shut local farms and local factories and put a lot of people out of work. Then you have illegal international migration. And then you have revolutions.And, some of these developing companies do well with service industries (Like, call centres in New Delhi and Manila.) And some don't at all. They don't have much services to export.So, What Do You Do If Tariffs Aren't It?You end up with nuclear options and some nuclear flubs.So Canada won't abandon agricultural supply management. So the Trump Administration bans all dairy imports from Canada. Who cares? Exports are a very small part of the Canadian dairy market.And then Canada bans American dairy imports as a reprisal. The USA exports five times as much milk to Canada as Canada does to the USA. Canadian dairy farmers will smile.Mess too much with the markets of smaller developing countries in particular, and that will turn into a problem the USA doesn't need, without much gain in the meantime.Ban Their StuffThe USA could impose quotas or outright bars on goods from badly-behaved countries. Exports from those countries are a large part of all consumer goods and clothes sold on American shelves. United States production could eventually replace a whole lot more, but when they land on American store shelves, American consumers are going to feel like they are shopping in Winnipeg. Definitely jobs will be created for Americans (If the USA gets control of its southern border) but it won't be a job for job gain. American shoppers will look for more durability rather than planned obsolescence, and buy less. Maybe a patriotic American would think it is well worth it, to see at least some fellow Americans get jobs. In the meantime, hope, against hope, that the countries whose exports you quota or ban, don't take reprisals that put Americans out of work.What Can You Do About Foreign Wage Levels and Exchange Rates?In the new NAFTA negotiations the USA is trying to make Mexico raise their minimum wages. It doesn't look like Mexico will go for it. So, what do you do?I suppose the USA could impose a supplementary tariff on Mexican goods, to take account of low Mexican wages, or lower than the USA demands. So, say the going rate in Mexico for work in a manufacturing plant is equivalent to US$ 8 per hour and the USA insists that it go up to US$16, or else the tariffs kick in. (The USA could try to break it out by industry, but this would get very complicated.) Maybe this would coerce the Mexicans into raising their minimum wage, maybe.Now, that exchange rate. Charge Canada a special tariff because the Canadian dollar is too low? According to the USA, what should the Canadian dollar rise to, and how do you get it there? Canada has a free market policy for the value of its currency. It used to have fixed rates, but it cost the taxpayer a lot.What about the film and TV industry? Ban American film and TV companies from shooting outside of the US? As I said recently, given that the price of producing in Hollywood is higher than in Canada, American film and TV distributors would have to charge more for product, and maybe the demand would go down. The social media are out there as competitors.Don't Tariff Stuff You NeedPutting tariffs on Canadian steel and aluminum is the USA shooting itself in the foot. Aluminum and steel prices in the USA go up. Unless you know there is a better supplier, don't tariff that kind of thing, not even as a bargaining pressure strategy.The USA In A BoxI get it why a lot of Americans resent foreign competition and the way some countries treat American products, but nothing is all good. At the same time unemployment in the USA is low. These good conditions started in the Obama Administration. Mess around with trade and the USA could find itself back in 2008.I would like to see fair trade between the USA, Canada and everywhere. However it is really hard to make it work. Lower tariffs are almost irrelevant nowadays. It is these other issues that are really tough. At best you can resolve them one by one, slowly. No American Administration can do it fast.Martin LevineIs it justified to be a conservative in a liberal city and completely hate everyone there?July 11, 2018No, it is not an appropriate response.A City Isn't the People In ItCities aren't liberal. Cities aren't people, who have various political views. A city's population is an agglomeration of different people.You see this emerge in political polls. In any given place some people have strong political views, some have views that are just tendencies and a fair number have no political opinions at all. Also, a person's political views tend to be a mix a lot of the time. Some people can have hard left and hard right opinions at the same time.Let me give you a couple of profiles.Liberty Somewhere, Just Not in Your Suburb and You Don't Want to See Other People's LibertyYou could have a Canadian who is in favour of a woman's right to an abortion and the maximum possible freedom of speech, even at the risk of allowing hate speech to happen. However, you are not at all in favour of freedom in the use of land. You live in a pleasant, middle, class suburb. You want it to be just as pristine and wholesome as it could possibly be. You want ever last little bit of land in your suburb to be very tightly zoned . You do not want social housing in your area or anything that could attract “different” or alternative people.At the same time, you could believe that all levels of government should get out of the face of small businesspeople, not tax them so much, not impose as much paper work and regulations on them, and let them open whenever they want and sell whatever they want. But, just not in your burb. You are partially Libertarian, so you strongly believe that the government should not regulate anybody's sex life. If people want to have polyamorous marriages, let them. You just don't want it be flamboyant in your burb.At the same time you are really worried about climatic warming. You concede that business and personal freedom has to stop when it comes to carbon dioxide and methane emissions. In support of your climatic warming concerns, you believe that virtually all immigration to Canada has to be stopped. That is, you are an advocate of Zero Population Growth.I Am So Happy in Canada, And I Want It My WayYou immigrated to Canada a while ago. You like it here.You really like Canada's human rights and anti-hate laws. You like that multicultural programming very much. You really like all those social programmes, because you were poor when you started out here, and a lot of people in your ethnocultural community are still struggling. Generally, you are pretty happy with the Liberal Party of Canada and will keep on voting for them. Or, you might really like the New Democratic Party (Social democratic and socialist). They nominate a lot of visible minority candidates. They believe in equity and affirmative action strategies, for people like you or your kids.However, you see yourself as a social conservative. You don't want anybody to publish hate about LGBT people, but personally, you are really scared of them. You know perfectly well that they love to recruit and that they are after your kids. You despise the idea of gay-straight alliances in schools. Couldn't there just be different schools where they could put those people? Why should they be allowed to parade around and hold hands in public?Then there are religions and ethnic groups you do not like. You know they are bad people. Why is Canada letting them immigrate here?And then, you believe that sometimes, freedom of religion means that Canadian laws shouldn't be equally imposed on everybody and sometimes your cultural rights come first. What if polygamy is traditional in your culture? How does it hurt anybody if your community does it in Canada?But Aren't Conservatives and Liberals More Polarized in the USA?It's just my impression as an outsider. However, currently the USA seems to be a place where some people are talking very loud and the rest not so much. (Actually I could say the same about Canada, but dogmatic people here have learned to be dogmatic with political correct, nice-sounding, big hug language.)So, you have self proclaimed Conservatives and self-proclaimed Liberals, laying down the law and hating on each other, proclaiming it in the social media and in the regular media, if and when they get a chance. But Americans, as individuals, are a very complex mix.Here you are, a young man, crying out your righteous contempt for cucks and libertards. No bureaucrat is going to tell you want to do. You believe in Posse Comitatus. The feds and the states have no right to impose taxes on you. They have no right to tell you where to live and how. You make one exception, the federal government should do its job, seal America's borders and keep those foreigners out. The jobs they are stealing belong to you and real Americans speak English only.And then, you have an older male, Conservative. Social security is his right, so the young folks can shut up and pay for it. You despise government owned medical facilities, except for veterans. But, you are getting a little creaky as you get older. You can handle Obamacare, but it would be nice if they would call it something else (Trumpacare?) You live in a well-secured, gated community. No, other people do not have the liberty to go there. You have a weapon too. If somebody you don't know comes over the wall, you are not going to ask for their five most recent Alt-Right postings. You will stand your ground.And also, sure, America needs a border wall with Mexico. However, your gardener works for less than the state minimum wage, speaks Spanish only, and, even in Spanish, does not start any dumb talk about his “rights”. Yes, there's a barrio at the edge of town, but it works for you. Maybe building that wall can be put off. Instead, they should raise your social security benefits and lower your medicare deductibles. Maybe, later on, the federal government can fix up some Work Permit thing with Mexico. Those folks in the barrio will be legal, that barrio might be a fair amount larger, but who needs to assimilate them? Let some of the signs be in Spanish, particularly if it is a place just for those folks and you don't want to go there.Are All Conservatives Friends of All Conservatives?It doesn't look like it to me. I think if my pristine suburb, ZPG Canadian, ran into my ethnocultural, social conservative, let more of us into Canada, Canadian, they might start arguing, of course respectfully and courteously, and apologizing to each other when they have no choice but to say, “You are a bad person. You are a threat to me. I'm really sorry that you don't fully comprehend that”.Maybe my young, Posse Comitatus, American Conservative, and my social security senior American, might be rather more direct with each other.Politics Does Not a Person MakePeople are parents, lovers, workers, golfers, etc., before they are politics.Say that there is someone in my synagogue who I have seen really loving his kids and treating his wife with respect. He gives like crazy to charity. He is as honest in business as the day is long. He visits elderly sick people with no local family at home, and in the hospital.We get to talking in between praying, and he tells me that he does not like the way the Government of Israel treats Palestinians. I, by contrast, think they are nowhere near tough enough.So, are we going to start hollering at each other in front of the Rabbi? Do I tell him, no, now I know you are an evil traitor, you have no right to pray with good Jewish people, so get the hell out!No, instead my favourite synagogue will kick me and tell me not to return. I end up being the loser.Politics are one part of your life. As a personal view, when we are talking about person to person, they should be the last part. Apply too many political checks to your interpersonal relationships and you lose.Here's an example. You are at this dance club, holding on to the bar, because you don't have too much “game” with the ladies. Then, this gal comes up to you. She isn't dressed up nice girl conservative. In fact, she doesn't use too much makeup and she is downright aggressive.And she says to you, “OK guy, your life as an Incel is officially over. We are leaving now, together. By the time I am finished with you, you are going to be real lucky not to have a heart attack.”You haven't had any serious female company for a real long time. So, what are you going to do now? Are you going to demand to see her official Republican card and show you at least five of her Alt-Right postings that you totally agree with? If you are going to do that, maybe you should start hating on yourself.Hating A Lot of People Makes You Scared, Distorts Your Life and Wastes Your TimeYes, in a given town, more or less people might be what you identify as a Liberal. However, your job has the money rolling in. You just went to the local gun show and you had plenty of cash for the semi-automatic weapon of your dreams. You have been on the Alt-Right hot line and know some local people who know where you are coming from and really get with your ideas. In the meantime, you and the heart attack girl are a regular number.How many people in that town do you want to hate on so much that you are scared about what they and your friends might personally do to you? If you are not scared of them, why spend your time on hating all kinds of people who can't even touch you?I am not suggesting that there aren't certain people who you would really want to hate on. If you want to do it in your political life, you need to find the real bad actors, worry a fair amount about them and talk with your friends about how you can defeat them. Some of those people you think you ought to like, call themselves Conservatives, but don't at all agree with you about what Conservative is. You might want to hate on some of them too.The rest of the population, who cares about them, if you you have your social circle and your companionship and a good livelihood? You are better off to say, the hell with them, they are not worthy of my attention.Then you can live your own life to the fullest, and folks you don't like won't bring you down.Martin LevineIs the rising nationalism in Europe more on the liberal side in regards to regular citizens in the country or is it more on the authoritarian side? I’m referring to citizens of the country and not the immigrants.July 3, 2018I would have said it was on the more authoritarian side, but to some extent Denmark has changed my mind. The following article is from Vox. It is their property. I am providing the link for information purposes:https://www.vox.com/world/2018/7...“In Denmark, children over the age of 1 who live in low-income, heavily Muslim immigrant communities that the government classifies as “ghettos” will soon be subject to mandatory training in “Danish values.””“The law, which was passed on May 28, is part of a broader government initiative titled “One Denmark without Parallel Societies: No Ghettos in 2030.” The plan aims to eradicate what the Danish government says are “parallel communities” in Denmark that are rife with crime and populated by poor, uneducated immigrants from “non-Western countries” who are not being properly integrated into Danish society.”The law even includes teaching the kids about Christmas. As a Canadian Jew I don't know how I would feel if some Canadian province demanded that. (The federal government can't, because education is a provincial matter in Canada.) But, as a Canadian Jew, I know I don't have a great deal of choice.And, Denmark is as liberal, tolerant and kind a society as you are going to get. Interesting though that they define their integration problem with an economic measure. It applies to children of welfare-recipient parents who live in subsidized housing ghettos. Presumably, it doesn't apply to children of self-supporting immigrant parents who live in their own home, presumably in a non-ghetto district, and have got sort of Danish.At Least Think About It Before You Throw Out the Racist TagOne should always be on the alert for front and back door racism. However, I don't think the behaviour of the Danish Government should simply be ascribed to authoritarian racism. The Government of Denmark isn't using dog whistle, oblique language to stir up racism. They have been quite upfront and put their sociocultural cards on the table. They are making three, explicit, easily identifiable arguments:-In Denmark, immigrant economic failure produces cultural failure.-They are saying that cultural failure is specifically, the failure of the children of economically-failed immigrants to become part of the Danish mainstream, and they are specific about what that mainstream means.-The country of Denmark is an historic, cultural, economic and political enterprise. That enterprise has superior rights to any immigrant who wants their kids to be “different”.The Danish Government is also saying that the problem can be solved. They are not bemoaning the failure of immigrant children to adhere to the stereotypical Scandinavian body stereotype. They are saying to the kids, yes, you can be non-white and now, get with the Danish programme. And, you welfare parents, be quiet!Canada Got There First, Although Not in Our Modern, Big Hug WayOur Canada is meant to be the Western Hemisphere home of lovable liberalism. We are the antithesis of Donald Trump, his base and all the authoritarian, racist and generally mean and nasty things they so passionately believe in. So, obviously, we have beat the lefty-lib nations of Western and Northern Europe at their own game. No authoritarianism here, eh. Aren't we splendid!Actually, that is not the case. Modern, big hug Canada is benefiting from a swift kick approach to immigrant integration that it put into place, somewhere around the 1890's and never totally dropped. We can claim to be nice now because we were mean before.Oh, Those Ruthenians!Ruthenians are the people nowadays called Ukrainians. Clifford Sifton, Canada's Minister of the Interior from 1896 to 1905, though they would make fine immigrants to Canada's Prairies, given that not enough British people could be persuaded to settle in that, kind of Siberian, region.The following is from the website “British Immigrants in Montreal”. It is their property:https://www.british-immigrants-i...“Sifton felt strongly that town dwellers, artisans, shopkeepers and labourers were not desirable immigrants as they didn’t make good pioneers and would increase the population of the major cities, add to unemployment, create slum areas and become a “festering sore…which…will remain as long as Canada endures.””“Create slum areas”. It seems that Mister Sifton was awfully prescient about the Danish issue.“ I think a stalwart peasant in a sheep-skin coat, born on the soil, whose forefathers have been farmers for ten generations, with a stout wife and a half-dozen children, is good quality. A Trades Union artisan who will not work more than eight hours a day and will not work that long if he can help it, will not work on a farm at all and has to be fed by the public when his work is slack is, in my judgement, quantity and very bad quantity. I am indifferent as to whether or not he is British-born. It matters not what his nationality is;such men are not wanted in Canada, and the more of them we get the more trouble we shall have.”As the article indicates, the men in sheepskin coats, who were then identified as Ruthenians, were not at all popular with everybody in those good old days. There was this fear they wouldn't integrate, that is, become British.Quickly, Canadian society reached solutions to persuade them to Britify. This was decades before the jolly Canadian multiculturalism. The kids had to attend public schools. There, they were taught that there was one Canadian way to live, the British one. They were required to learn English. They were required to sing G-d Save the King and all the accoutrements. It took some years for the “real”, British Canadians to let them off the hook. The following, from the Manitoba Historical Society, described what was deemed a suitable way to persuade the Ruthenians that resistance was futile, that is to intern them as enemy aliens:http://www.mhs.mb.ca/docs/mb_his...And, while we use nicer approaches in Canada nowadays, and encourage multicultural festivals, the swift kick approach never really left. It shifted from the nationalist right to more of an approach from the politically correct life. Your kids will be taught English as a Second Language whether you want it or not and they will learn the full provincial curriculum. Speak too passionately about religious groups, lifestyles and ethnicities that you don't like and Canada's hate speech laws will kick in. You don't want to raise your kids the Canadian way? The child welfare authorities are looking over your shoulder, the more so if you are on social assistance. Say something nasty to a woman anywhere, you will get feministically punished. Physically chastize your wife and kids and you will get in jail.Denmark, Belgium, Sweden, Italy, Greece, etc, Too Much, Too Fast, No StrategyThe liberal democracies of Western and Northern Europe never had Canada's Ruthenian, you get British now, era. They never had the benefit of that era to elaborate ways to keep immigrants and their kids, “in their place”. Instead the mass of their “difficult” immigrants arrived after these countries had reinvented themselves into a modern, social democratic, mold. Canada has been selecting immigrants for economic reasons for years (Remember, no Siftonian slum areas.) The Europeans never had that type of selection and built up their immigrant populations from refugee claimants and undocumented migrants. You might call their general approach to immigrant integration, “happy go lucky”. The result has sometimes been, Danish-type failures.One probably wouldn't call Italy, Greece, Poland and Hungary liberal democracies. Since they never claimed to be, they can fast forward into being mean, and take an authoritarian approach right from the top.Canada had the benefit of being happily mean and nasty before it got sort of nice. However I believe that, concerning immigration, nice countries like Denmark are plunging into their mean and nasty period now.This does not mean that those countries have stopped being liberal in their traditional context. All that “liberal” was meant to be for residents committed to the local identity, most of them able to pull their own weight and pay the necessarily high social programme taxes. There never was a liberal model to encompass multicultural, economically failing immigrants, and their failing kids.Even a liberal society will protect its own basis for liberalism. If there are too many, needy, unintegrating, ghettoized immigrants, it is almost inevitable that they will be excluded from the liberal society of that country. The parents become cultural enemy aliens. The economic and cultural swift kick is highly likely to follow.Turn Around at the European CrossroadsThe term “crossroads” has been turned into something of a cliche, but I believe that Denmark is manifesting a turning point for the social democratic, prosperous countries of Europe. They have now put into law, that lock them out from the liberal state. Poorly-integrating immigrants and their kids are not deemed to be members of that state. Now they have to behave like Ruthenians and accept that their kids will be compelled into the historic culture of the state. The Government of Denmark has been Canadian, traditional style mean. We re-educate your kids Danish style or you don't get welfare. The next step is kind of obvious and sounds almost Trumpian. You don't qualify for welfare anymore, well, we have to take your kids away.Be Nationalistic So You Can Stay LiberalThe European social states are learning a unituitive reality. If you are getting large numbers of immigrants compared to your population, you can only stay liberal by defining just what your national identity means and being authoritarian about it. Really nasty authoritarianism would mean deporting a whole lot of people. You don't want to do that, so you have to forestall it by being nicer authoritarians, and forcing compliance.If you are a European state that is not a prosperous, liberal minded social democracy, you have two mean and meaner choices. Impose Danish-type laws, or, get seriously more mean and deport people.The liberal social democracies of Europe have no choice about, how mean the other non-liberal European countries get. The European Union imposing fines will not stop them. They liberal democracies can only keep a united Europe together by accepting that the non-liberal countries are entitled to their authoritarian meanness.Martin LevineWhat would happen if Canada, US, and Mexico had open borders, like some European countries?June 22, 2018For a retired Canadian visa officer this is just too interesting a topic to leave alone.That Baseline Before the Border LineIn order to measure the effect of people having free movement across the border lines, you would have to do a baseline study before they start. This would mean a very comprehensive economic, political science and sociological measurement before the border opens, in all three countries and not just near the border. Some data would be available “off the shelf” from existing demographic and economic data series. However, some of it would have to be purpose done.Here's an example of a fast departure from the baseline. Existing American resort areas have learned how to put up with Canadian visitors. However, Canadians would be thinking differently if they could simply go and live in the USA, or Mexico, wherever they liked and just as long as they liked.So, let's see Canadians take the plunge. Some of us live in badly overheated housing markets. What if we decide to sell out? It wouldn't be very hard for an average home sale in the Greater Vancouver Area to yield you about USD 1,400,000 or maybe considerably more.Century 21 has this listing for a charming looking home in Mobile, Alabama:https://www.century21.com/real-e...USD 199,000 for four bedrooms and two and a half baths! This is about CAD$265,000. You could buy for cash and still have well over USD1,000,000 to put in the bank.Yes, you would need private medical insurance but you have tons of money to pay for it. Also, your consumer goods are going, altogether, to be a lot cheaper. Think about gas, groceries, linens, tires, small appliances, liquor, lower state taxes,etc. You could probably save enough out of those things to pay a large part of the monthly premiums. (Presuming the United States Government could stop us for qualifying for Obamacare. Can you imagine the case in the United States Supreme Court!)So, you have this brand new type of foreigner, an entitled, full resident of the United States.We would be able to work in the USA. What if I decide to semi-retire in the sunshine and do some consulting, including consulting to American clients? Nothing could stop me.In 2017 the Mobile Census Metropolitan Statistical Area had an estimated population of 413,955. Say, 25,000 of us Canadians go to live in Mobile. Watch us drive up property values. Watch us compete in the labour market.You'd end up with a Canadian neighbourhood, a nice one, because a lot of us new-Mobileans would have just checked out of the Greater Vancouver and Greater Toronto housing markets. Compared to a lot of other Mobileans we have heavy spending power. Watch us tell the local supermarket that we expect to see Canadian beer pop-up. Watch us tell the local cable company that we expect to see a good selection of Canadian channels. Watch Mobile begin to shift and change.Then, the heavy duty socio-cultural stuff. The aren't going to be a lot of evangelicals and Southern Baptists among those Canadians. There will probably be a fair number of well-educated people among them. After all, they are confident they know how to survive in the USA.Think of the conversations across the backyard fence. Think of those Canadians getting the right to vote in country and state elections. Think of how Trumpian, working class Alabamans are going to feel. Even with that baseline we don't know how things are going to work out. By and large I think most of the Americans of Mobile won't like it at all.Take It CloserEvidently places near the international borders are going to be ina special situation. White Rock, British Columbia is a prosperous suburban retirement town for Vancouver, right on the American border. It is kind of full.And there's Blaine, Washington, White Rock's good neighbour to the south. Blaine isn't especially well off. It stands a good chance of becoming White Rock's Lebensraum.I can think of reverse situations. Downtown Buffalo is directly across the Niagara River from Fort Erie, Ontario, a quiet sort of place. Fort Erie isn't that prosperous. Some of the people are of modest means. What if some enterprising entrepreneur wanted to set up a gated, American-oriented community, just a four kilometre commute to the centre of downtown Buffalo. There might not be much that the Town of Fort Erie could do about it.The same for Windsor, Ontario. Modest property values and directly across the Niagara River from downtown Detroit.So, you have this merging process in some communities along the border. My guess is that the richer, better-educated folks will optimalize their living arrangements. The working class and the poor get displaced. Americans and Canadians who aren't experienced, or don't want to deal with, foreigners, get a culture shock they don't want.Mexico ArrivesThe day arrives when Mexican citizens can cross the border and go to live in the USA as they like. There are over 100,000,000 people in Mexico. A lot of them are poor. Particularly in the southwestern USA there are well-established Mexican communities that can greet them. Some of the people there are family.Just like the Canada-USA border, there are going to be local effects. What will happen to Brownsville and Matamoros when they become one community? The United States Border Patrol will have to stand by helplessly while the people they have been taught to arrest come and go as they please. In 2014 the Brownsville–Harlingen metropolitan area had an estimated population of 420,392. It is one of the poorest places in the USA. As of 2016, Matamoros had a population of 520,367. Matamoros has maquiladoras, but Mexican wages are very low. It would be interesting to watch what is already recognized as the Matamoros–Brownsville Metropolitan Area depart off that baseline. There are a lot of variables. What if the State of Texas doesn't have the resources to enforce its minimum wage laws and flipping burgers at MacDonald's in Harlingen for poor money is still better than what you can get from working at that maquiladora car plant?But, think on a bigger scale a little father from the border. What would happen to the Greater Los Angeles Area? Undocumented Mexican residents would suddenly acquire legal status, unless some transitional period was arranged. But, the transition would end sooner or later. What if another million Mexicans moved into the region?In bilingual Canada we have arrangements. If the English or French linguistic minority in any given area is large enough, they are entitled to federal services in their own language. In some cases the provinces are obligated too. The following story is from the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation. It is their property:https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/m...How will the Greater Los Angeles area cope as its population of legal, Mexican residents grows so greatly? How long could they resist official bilingualism? When would their speeding tickets have to be in Spanish too and will they have to create a separate, Spanish-language public school board?People Move But Trade Stays StuckThe European Union is a free trade area and a free movement area. The EU has various procedures set up to support the poorer countries in the Union. It has a transnational Parliament.What if the European Union didn't have what we call in Canada equalization payments? The Government of Canada distributes money from the better-off “have” provinces” to the less well-off, “have not” ones. The EU does this between countries, in its own way.Say the European Union had let Greece sink, during its financial crisis, right back to the poverty it had in the 1950's. Watch much of the population of Greece leave for Germany and Sweden.This is the dilemma that would face a North America with free movement of people, but no social and economic union. Mexico has not advanced far enough in NAFTA. Unless there was a sudden, very unlikely upsurge in Mexican prosperity, Mexico would become a giant version of that unsupported Greece.Working Class America Takes an Awful HitEven its current baseline state, working class America is not doing all that well. It is hard to imagine how, they would not be the Americans who suffer most from open migration borders.There would be more than one Mobile-type situation. Prosperous migrants would identify various rather economically-limited, but pleasant to live in when you have money, places in the USA. Working class Americans would face economic competition for property and jobs, competition from different cultures and competition for social status, that they aren't prepared for.Then, think about that bilingual Greater Los Angeles. It would be very binational in character. No more reserves of pride for members of the old-stock working class. Instead there would be a situation that would be an anathema to them. No common American identity. They have to share their Los Angeles with a highly motivated, permanently resident, culturally proud, very large group of people who waive a different flag.And the same for the Greater Miami Area, maybe Dallas, Houston, San Antonio, New Orleans, and substantial parts of Chicago, Denver, Washington, D.C. and the Greater New York City area.Once those old-stock working class Americans are humbled, what happens to American politics? What happens to the Republican Party? What happens to the Democratic Party, already a friend to the racial minorities of the USA but wanting to regain at least part of the traditional working class?No American Government Would Agree to ItWithout an European Union-type, socio-economic charter, free migration across the two borders would create a situation that no American government could tolerate. For Canada and Mexico, well, maybe it wouldn't be so bad.The United States would never tolerate making a socio-economic agreement with Mexico. They would never agree to provide Mexico with transfer payments.The American working class would depart from its baseline and sink.Free migration just can't happen. Perhaps in some far away time, Mexican living standards will rise to those of that supported Greece. Then things might be different.Martin LevineNow that people immigrate into the US without assimilating, how can you trust your fellow American? If the immigrant chooses not to assimilate, are they still called American?June 8, 2018Looking at it from outside, we see old-stock Americans flinging insults and hatred at each other. When would an immigrant get the chance to be as despised and distrusted? If you distrust another American-born American, do they deserve to call themselves American?This question presumes that most American-born Americans feel strong solidarity with each other and that immigrants are sort of challengers.This type of solidarity will never happen in the USA. Enough Americans have reminded me. The USA is a constitutional country where the sovereignty of the individual is always paramount. In that kind of country you can not have any all encompassing collectivity. This is the price of being an American.The only society where one could even approach that type of trust is an ethnically - based one, where individuals see themselves as being members of a “family”. Communist-based systems tried to force solidarity, and failed. Canada has a sort of myth about social solidarity, but it is just that, a myth. A limited type of solidarity is created by social programming that tries to reach out to the total population as much as possible. However Canadians tend to prize their regional identities and their ethnocultural heritages. It is not what the author of the question is looking for.Trust Is a Personal Matter, Not a Political OneThe author of the Question is talking about trust in one's personal life. They aren't talking about the limited sort of trust that can exist between two countries, or between a union and management, in a contractual agreement.In order to have a type of trust that is beyond individual to individual relations, there has to be a “we” and there has to be a “them”.So, in this case who is the “we”? I respect the author's concerns. We all want to live in a country where we can trust the people around us. However, I maintain that, except in citizenship, there isn't any American “we”. Instead there is an illusion about belonging that isn't supported by American reality.Myths Can't Create Social UnityArtificial Canadian “We's”What I am speaking of are myths that attempt to bind a country together. I am not just talking about the USA. Some time ago, a very prominent Canadian historian proudly put forward the concept that Canada was a “peaceable kingdom”. This sort of sounded right, because Canada is a constitutional monarchy. It doubtless sounded good on the campus of the University of Toronto, which is certainly a peaceable place.However, the “peaceable kingdom” concept was not much more than a fantasy. The modern, nice, big hug, Canada is a modern innovation. In fact Canadian history has a great deal of violence. This was directed at indigenous Canadians in particular. However there was plenty left around for unionists, ethnocultural groups, people of colour, gays, demonstrators and others.Also, Canada has fought in several very bloody wars. Canada's participation was justified but there was nothing peaceable about it. A sizable part of the history of Canada in the twentieth century, was the country in sorrow as a result of war casualties, and then the painful, protracted struggle of families and communities to recover.Canada never could be a “we-ness” because there are two official language groups. Much of the recent history of English-speaking Canada is the decline of the ethnic, British “we” and the often reluctant acceptance that there wouldn't, ever more, be a “we” Canada. Instead, Canada became a country where different individuals and groups get along by acceptance of laws, regulations, official language acts and workplace codes of behaviour.Artificial American “We's”Here is a concept that some Americans will dislike. The American “we” is a construct much more than a personal reality. Myths were used to bind a nation of very different, very individualistic people, into some sort of politically manageable unit.There were myths about baseball, myths about the Old West, myths about valiant Confederate soldiers, myths about unilateral American victories in wars, where the United States actually fought alongside other, brave armies. There was Manifest Destiny, there was the City on the Hill, there was the solitary Cold War bulwark against Soviet Communism under desperate threat, on its own, in a supposedly collectivist, socialism-positive world.These myths are not what individual Americans really experience. They experience a common identity in their families, in their places of worship, in their ethnic groups, in their lifestyle communities. There is no way that all these different identities can be combined into one, common, “All-American” identity. Really, it is not much different from Canada. The USA is a place where disparate, and frequently conflicted, groups and individuals, are kept a coherent country by the acceptance of federal and state laws, municipal bylaws, workplace codes and the unofficial acceptance of English as America's official language.So, What Is Your Bottom Line on Immigrants?I am not flinging arrogant criticisms against the USA. We have the same problem in Canada too.Can Canadians Trust Their Immigrants?Assimilation, immigration, acculturation and accommodation mean different things to different Canadians. We have had plentiful debates about Canadian values and protecting the beliefs and identities of “old stock” Canadians. Often, the people who are speaking lack a factual knowledge base about immigrants. They don't know how many immigrants are settling in any given part of Canada. They don't know how much English or French the immigrants speak. They don't know what their skills are, and how much individual immigrants can be rational about life in a new country.Canada has had its share of terrorist acts. Individual extremists who identify as being Muslim fundamentalists are presented as being very representative of Muslim Canadians in general.In the meantime, whatever facts are available, do not support an extreme view about the mass of immigrants in Canada. We see plenty of immigrants speaking adequate English and French and obeying the law. For the most part adult immigrants work. If they take out a mortgage they live with the terms. Whatever their own views, they obey political correctness in the office. A lot of them go out to vote and some run for office.I believe that a lot of the concern expressed in Canada, about Canada's identity, is a cry of sadness about myths that no one can believe anymore. It is in your face. The old, more homogeneous Canada is gone. There isn't any tightly-defined, overarching, English-speaking Canadian identity. There will never be one again, to the extent it ever existed.This isn't about whether you can trust all immigrants. Canada has many, many immigrant doctors who are trusted by their patients. There are immigrant members of Parliament who are as trusted as any politician is going to be. There are many, many thousands of immigrant workers who can be trusted to show up for work on time and do what their managers tell them to do.Can Americans Trust Their Immigrants?I believe that Americans have their own cry a cry of sadness, about myths that no American has real reasons to believe anymore. To the extent there ever was an All-American identity and tightly-defined value systems that most or all Americans were expected to believe in, it is gone. I think that, deep down, Americans who want to rely on that that All American identity to feel a sense of pride and community, know it is gone. That explains much of the anger and division in the United States.The United States has a major issue about immigrants that Canada doesn't. Its southern border is poorly controlled. Large amounts of undocumented immigration wears down the confidence of many Americans that their immigration system is under control. It is easy to understand how that creates fear of immigrants. However, just as for Canada, the available facts do not support the idea of most immigrants being untrustworthy. The United States has reliable immigrant doctors. It has many, many immigrants that speak passable English. Immigrants go to work and, just as in Canada, show up on time and do what they are told. Then, there are the visibly very successful immigrants to the USA, creating new science, technology and jobs for Americans. What strikes me as a Canadian is the intense gratitude that so many immigrants show for being in the United States.I have travelled to many countries. I have not seen anywhere, where an individual's trustworthiness was not prized. This is a universal value, not a Canadian or American one.Be Realistic and Lead Your Own Life.I would say the same thing to a Canadian or an American. Let individuals earn your trust. Don't trust or distrust whole groups of people unless you have very good reasons and some basis in fact.Also, be realistic about people. I have to admit it, being a Canadian-born person. There are lots of Canadian-born people who I wouldn't trust with a three metre pole. Canada's jails are full of people who were born right here in Canada. All the joys and advantages of being a Canadian-born person haven't made them, in the least, trustworthy.Having been a visa officer (That is, I was a Canadian immigration officer serving at a Canadian mission overseas.) I can say with confidence, immigrants are just folks. Most of them have moral codes and a concept of leading a responsible life.However, when you see people as just people, you have to accept that people are not infallible and don't always get done what they set out to do. An individual immigrant isn't likely to be “better” than most Canadian people.Canadianism or Americanism will not define your identity as an individual leading your life. Often you will fail, on your own. It's the same for people who immigrate to your country. No individual is ever going to be completely trustworthy and, fortunately, most individuals are not completely untrustworthy. This is your life and the immigrant's life. Trying to hide behind a cloak of nationalism won't change anything for anybody.Martin LevineCan a liberal explain why they view conservatives as ignorant?June 4, 2018I am probably not an ideally liberal person to answer. Also, I don't at all think that all conservatives are ignorant. Some of the things I will say probably would apply to liberals too. Nevertheless I will try to answer, from a Canadian point of view.Lopping The Top Off Of ConservatismIf one could talk about a “high-concept” version of conservatism, it's the assertion that a country as it is, or was, is close to being in the most possible optimal state, as it realistically could be. Consequently, changes in the life of a country should be carefully scrutinized, as those changes may easily be deleterious. Obviously, external forces may require a country to change how it deals with certain situations. That makes it even more imperative to define core values, laws and government policies that ought to be defined, preserved and defended, so any changes don't damage the country.The above is intellectually hard work that takes a lot of time. You probably need a fairly good education, ironically in the “liberal arts”, to do it in a coherent sort of way. Because of that, you can't use populism to do it. You need the William F. Buckleys of the USA to take it on, or I guess in Canada, the Conrad Blacks.What these intellectuals of the conservative world are likely to tell you is that, things take time. If you believe that the USA or Canada ought to revert, to some extent, to what was there earlier, it is going to take some well-defined policies to get there and it will be slow work. They are also likely to tell you that it may take some innovation. For example, if you prize the communitarian, family-oriented values of rural Canada, how do you create them in Canada's growing cities?Liberals don't have quite the same issues. There is an underlying assertion that change is going to be good for most people in a country. Liberals in various countries tend to have a well-understood package of what ought to happen. That is the redistribution of income, using social programmes that have already been, to a greater or lesser extent, defined, using aggressive human rights initiatives, reaching out to, defending, validating and, assuring the equality of various societal minorities, etc. The intellectual spadework was done a long time ago. In any case, since liberals don't have so much in the way of issues with expertise, if another inspiring, liberal intellectual pops up, so much the better.However, William F. Buckley-type intellectuals are in short or almost no supply. Without these types of highly-respected individuals, what started as conservatism can wander off into the darkness. You need your conservative patricians to put a break on things.I Want My Personal Issues To Be My Country's Political OnesTimes have not been good for the working class in either the United States or Canada. Times have been even worse for working class men. The traditional manufacturing industries that gave those men decently-paid, unionized jobs have evaporated. Currently unemployment rates in both countries are low, but jobs aren't what they used to be. Steady, union-rate jobs with fixed benefit pensions have gotten scarce or, depending on where you are, just aren't attainable any more.A big difference between Canada and the USA is that, in Canada the liberal benefit world has been engineered to cover everybody. Canada has a Liberal Party. Canada has a Parliamentary system of government, at both the federal and provincial levels. The Liberal Party, or any party, can only stay in office by means of a maximum reach-out, getting enough people in the different constituencies to vote for their candidates until they get elected, enough to make up a majority in Parliament. Over the years the Liberal Party has built up a menu of social programmes and policies that are designed to get those votes. The Conservative Party sometimes does some of their own and seldom cancels one that is in place.It hasn't worked out quite that way in the USA. There isn't a Liberal Party as such. The Democratic Party doesn't nowadays strive very hard to be one. They did at one time but, at some point, they became focused on minority groups ,and almost conceded working class and rural whites.What leadership do those working class and rural whites have? They know life is getting worse. There isn't a supply of highly-educated, scholarly, old-fashioned patricians to explain the situation to them. There are some talk show hosts, some inflammatory politicians, people on the Internet with blogs, not especially-qualified people declaiming in social media groups, etc.So, you get what you ought to expect. Individual, distressed people with lots of life problems, who want some sort of believable answer to their problems. Their distress is very real. Their pride is in distress too. In some ways the past really was a lot better for them. They have some reasons to say that the USA is more challenged by foreign entities than it was. The Soviet Union was a comprehensible threat. There was a broad national consensus that the way to deal with them was a strong, proud, heavily resourced military deterrent. That's not hard for anybody to understand.But what can the average American do about Chinese economic power and very low Mexican wages? What can they do about lone-wolf terrorists? What can they do about a southern border that is so inadequately secured that the American labour market is under threat?The personal distress and feeling of threat becomes personal anger. However it is the anger of less-educated, less-sophisticated people. It isn't fair to call them “ignorant”, but on their own, they haven't the least chance of developing implementable solutions that might make their lives better. There aren't a lot of knowledgeable people, with administrative experience, that have their back. Instead there are politicians, who present themselves as conservative, who don't have enough altruism or enough ideas to help. So, we have less-educated people, in economic and self-esteem trouble, furious and so not amenable to reason. They can appear ignorant.Resolve the Civil WarCanada's climate can not support plantation agriculture. Consequently there was little slavery here. Canada does not share a border with a developing country. This keeps the anger level in the mainstream population relatively lower. Some members of minority groups have good reasons to be angry, but after all, they are minorities.Canada has its share of racists but the deep, racist, passion is confined to a fairly small fringe of the population. Most people who call themselves conservative want nothing to do with it.The Civil War and its aftermath did not resolve the deep racism of the Old Confederacy. It has been allowed to persist. There are lots of excuses.Get beyond claims of Southern traditions and beyond anger at Black people who live in urban ghettos. How do you provide a rational justification for deep, angry racism? There aren't any conservative patricians to take on the job. Who has statistics to present, or any type of evidence, to support angry racial stereotypes?Racism is a type of conservatism, in that it contends things were better before. But there is no alternative but to see racialist views as the views of very ignorant and possibly quite dangerous, and in the USA, heavily-armed people. These appear to be a sizable part of all people in America who call themselves conservative and American conservatism either has to reject them or accept the ignorant tag. There is no apparent leadership among American conservatives to take a systematic rejection of racism on, so the tag will have to stick.Entertainment Can Make You Really DumbWe see it in Canada too. Even the news media try to act as entertainers. Most Canadian news media are commercial in nature and need to sell advertising. Emotions, fearful predictions, telling people to be pride for no particular reason, sells adds. A commentator saying to an audience, the effects of something or other aren't very clear or are unlikely to be widespread, and, if it happens, there are solutions and life will go on, won't.Science fiction should have to do with the latest series of Star Trek. News that presents the world as a developing, dystopic nightmare full of threats and enemies, is good at whipping up emotions but not good at all at whipping up comprehension, a realistic understanding of perspective, or political opinions strongly related to reality.An educated, knowledgeable person, liberal or conservative, has as fighting chance of understanding that they are being told some serious nonsense. However what is a less-educated person meant to do?The news broadcasters and commentators seem like high status people you ought to defer to. However, they can end up making you much more ignorant.I am admitting that I perceive a skew between liberals and conservatives. Enthusiastic liberals tend to be educated, at least in a formal sense. If they are university graduates they have at least a little bit of training in screening and evaluating facts. No, I am not suggesting that this means they are always right. You can consider yourself a liberal, and be university educated, but you can still lack common sense, lack knowledge, or the interest in having any, about the lives of people who aren't like you, only care about the people you like, be centred on your own interests and completely lacking in empathy. However you are not ignorant. You just lack the will to fully use the education you are lucky to have, or derive a sizable part of your own self-esteem and pride by looking down on people who are an “easy mark” for your contempt.Can Conservatives Become More Educated?It's very tough to be in an economic and social hole. How do you get more educated when you are working at two jobs, scrambling to be earn a survival income?It is very easy to fall into anger when your personal circumstances are deteriorating, you can't think of anything that can help, and the people who are meant to identify and empathize with you, really see you as a tool in their search to enrich themselves and enhance their egos.I don't mean any disrespect to less educated people who are struggling, but if they see themselves as conservative, they need educated, knowledgeable conservatives with policy sense and enough altruism to really want to help them. They need to be told the facts as they stand. They need to know that being racist will just keep you ignorant, give liberals a good excuse to dismiss the value of your life, campaign against you and, if they get power, treat you as people who deserve to be harshly punished.But, who is out there to give them that help? We don't see them much in Canada, where working class conservatives are less angry and sometimes easier to talk to. Who is going to do it in the USA?Martin LevineHow will a trade war between the USA, Canada, and Mexico most likely end?June 1, 2018This general topic will probably keep on going for a while. I might as well add on to my Answer yesterday.It Depends What You Call a Trade WarIf the United States Administration was hoping to score a quick victory on NAFTA, by means of the new tariffs, they have already failed. Neither Mexico nor Canada will fold.The tariffs also have a weird element that is likely to hurt American manufacturers and consumers quite a lot. The USA isn't close to being self-sufficient in aluminum. The only practical foreign provider is Canada. It isn't a good idea to be slinging tariffs around when you are a captive market.Aluminum is of course vital for a lot of American civilian and military production. The Americans will have to keep on buying it from Canada. American importers will pay the duty and then pass the costs along to their customers, American consumers, other American manufacturers and wholesalers, and the military. The United States Administration will use the tariffs as an additional tax on American industry.There is another not very big, but real risk to the USA. That is, the Trump Administration is making Canadian manufacturers pay more attention to offshore markets. Those manufacturers may be pleased to find markets with less capricious, and less irrational administrations. Canada has a lot of productive capacity for aluminum but there is a limit. If Canadian manufacturers can close some good deals offshore, than there may be limits on how much is left to export to the USA.It may not be possible for the USA to ramp up its aluminum production capacity. Modern, efficient aluminum smelters are huge, take up a lot of power and need to be not too far from a port. Properly managed, the environmental risk can be kept small, but there is going to be some. How many Americans are going to welcome this type of thing in their back yard?In terms of a scenario, this principal can be applied to other types of Canadian exports and presumably Mexican and European Union ones as well. If Canadian suppliers find substantial offshore markets for softwood lumber they will be strongly tempted to go for it. Year after year, different United States administrations have tried to suppress imports of Canadian softwood lumber. If Canadian suppliers can find offshore markets for softwood lumber, in a country that isn't interested in practising “linkage”, that is, taking trade action against one unrelated product because they are mad at trade in others, it becomes very attractive.It's not so different from aluminum. If the American home building industry loses access to reasonably-priced Canadian softwood lumber, they will raise their prices to American home buyers. American industries that rely on new homes for a market, furniture, appliances, kitchens, etc., will take a hit.And, that's how it is likely to stay. Canadian producers of various things may look much harder for long-term contracts in countries without a political axe to grind. The Government of Canada has an Export Development Corporation that will help them look.In the meantime, Internet-based trade in services will go on.Canada used to have very high tariffs on a lot of things for a long time. This was part of the “National Policy”. The idea was to encourage the growth of Canadian manufacturing, by suppressing or barring foreign imports.Some factories got built. However, with no foreign competition, there wasn't much reason to modernize or innovate. You end up with understandings between producers, let's not do much. It isn't price-fixing. How do you suppress it? Canadian consumers were forced to pay.This was one of the reasons that Canada became interested in free trade.The USA has more producers than Canada. However, the Internet facilitates lots of communication between producers and industry lobbies, and the intent doesn't have to be too obvious. It makes it much easier to have cozy agreements.So, we have a USA with scarcities and price inflation. Innovation and technology doesn't advance so fast. US production gets suppressed. Foreign producers get educated to look for more secure markets than the USA. Other countries continue to develop free trade agreements with each other and multinational marketing. Consumers can afford imports from those tariff free producers. US producers, handicapped by retaliatory tariffs, get locked out. Any foreign manufacturers who are contemplating starting up production in the USA have to accept that, the production will be for the American market only. Even if you are incorporating American-made parts into your product, other countries may take reprisals.When a country launches punitive tariffs and non-tariff barriers, it's not the same as a war. It's a risky negotiating act. You have got to win big or you lose. If you lose, and don't admit it, then, you have launched a war, but it is on your own producers and consumers.What Will the Future Bring?The United States Administration cannot get the NAFTA agreement they insisted on. If they want to withdraw the United States from NAFTA now, there is a six month advance notice period. Apparently some Congressional approval is required, although there seems to be a disagreement about how much. But, the Congressional mid-terms are now only five months away. Even Republican Senators and Congress members will not want to campaign on NAFTA withdrawal, particularly as foreign reprisals start to bite. Canada, Mexico and the USA are targetting their reprisals at particular congressional and senatorial districts, to inflict damage on some campaigns for election and re-election.Canada and The European Union are now both complaining against the USA at the World Trade Organization. The “National Security” argument may be viewed with derision at the WTO. It may take a few months to get a decision, but it will be until January, 2019 until serious NAFTA negotiations can start again.The USA would suffer severely if they withdraw from the WTO. The WTO is a very complex set of agreements that cover most types of international trade. Locked out of the WTO, the USA will be at a serious trade disadvantage.It's January, 2019. The USA wants to continue the NAFTA negotiations, with their same demands. The answer to their demands will be the same as it was in 2018, no. The USA will no longer be able to use the National Security argument to impose tariffs.The next Canadian federal election will occur on Monday, October 21, 2019. As I said yesterday, if Prime Minister Justin Trudeau wants his Liberal Party of Canada to win that election, he will have to do some serious “walking tall” against the Trump administration. Justin Trudeau has acquired something of a reputation in Canada for being a wimp. However, he is losing that reputation fast. Yesterday he refused a ridiculous demand by Mike Pence, to agree to the five-year sunset clause on any future NAFTA agreement, or else the US Administration would not negotiate with him. He said a flat no and cancelled a trip to Washington. The Canadian media are beginning to complement him on finally showing some tough resolution. Justin Trudeau will very much want to maintain and enhance this new image, right up to election day.In the meantime, the European Union, Mexico and Canada will have had reprisal tariffs in place for a number of months. They will bite and bite and bite. American workers will lose a lot of jobs and pay higher prices for a lot of things.The USA could look about for other tariffs they could apply against Mexico, Canada and the European Union. But then there will be more reprisals and more bite in the USA. There is very little that the USA produces that Canada and Mexico can't buy somewhere else.Canada currently exports most oil, that is not needed for domestic purposes, to the USA. Overseas prices are higher, but Canada lacks sufficient pipeline capacity to get the crude oil to Canadian ports. Disputes have been going on for years about doubling the Trans Mountain Pipeline, which runs from the Alberta oil/tar sands to Port Metro Vancouver. There has been ferocious resistance from environmental groups in British Columbia, and the British Columbia provincial government, to the doubled pipeline. Kinder Morgan, an American company, was attempting to build it, but essentially, got worn out. However this past week, instead of the project stopping, the Government of Canada paid Kinder Morgan a negotiated price for the project and the federal government bought it, nationalizing it. A federal “Crown Corporation” has superior authority to any provincial government. The pipeline will get built. Just as soon as it is completed, as much as possible of that Alberta oil will be shipped overseas to offshore markets, not the USA.That pipeline is also part of Justin Trudeau's new macho package. He is getting yet more praise for being decisive. The reputation of the once powerful federal crown corporations had weakened over the years, with some of the biggest being privatized. Now, Canadians have been reminded that crown corporations can do a lot to resist the USA. They stand a good chance of becomming popular again, with the new Justin Trudeau resolutely promising to use them to stand up to the Americans.Canada has an elaborate system of social programmes. They are used a lot to mitigate problems for people in regions and industries that have taken an economic hit. As long as enough tax money, and profits from crown corporations, is being fed into the federal treasury, Justin Trudeau will have money to throw at individual Canadians who have been hit by the Trump Administration. That new pipeline, owned by a federal crown corporation, will help support the treasury. Canadian retaliatory tariffs against American goods and services are also tax money for that treasury.The NAFTA negotiations may go on and on, while the weakened US administration tries to get the deal it dreamed of. They won't get it. Neither Mexico or Canada will agree to the sunset clause. They won't agree to anything that will critically damage their car industries. Canada will not admit significantly more US dairy products, because the Canadian dairy lobby is much too powerful.Today Donald Trump was musing about the USA having separate trade agreements with Mexico and Canada instead. Neither Mexico nor Canada would have much if any interest. The USA would continue to make the same unacceptable demands and threats. There isn't any point in it.My best guess is that the USA backs down, and with very minor window-dressing, NAFTA stays as it is. The European Union has no more motivation to engage in bilateral negotiations with the USA then Canada or Mexico do. The Trump administration will get nothing there.In the meantime, the USA has lost virtually all of its credibility in trade negotiations, and, as a reliable trade partner. Canada and Mexico will continue to look elsewhere. American producers and consumers will have been damaged and the USA will have nothing to show for it.Martin LevineWhat will be the likely outcome of the new wave of tariffs against Mexico, Canada and the EU?May 31, 2018One could talk about short-term results and mid to long-term results.Short-TermAttempting to justify the new tariffs on “national security” grounds probably wasn't the best move. The European Union has already announced that they will take the matter to the World Trade Administration. If the USA loses, the Trump Administration will be in a difficult position. They could disregard the WTO decision, which might mean the USA withdrawing or being evicted from the WTO. If the USA tries to think up some other reason for the tariffs, they are highly likely to end up in front of the WTO again.The Trump Administration seems to have had mixed motivations in imposing the tariffs. They seem to have thought that the tariffs would force Mexico and Canada to accede to American demands in the NAFTA negotiations. However, at the same time they have imposed the tariffs on the European Union, although there are no impending American negotiations with them.The European Union, Canada and Mexico have all announced reprisals. The European Union is very big. They can impose reprisals on the United States that can be damaging, particularly to the working class Americans in Donald Trump's base.Canada and Mexico together can also inflict major harm on the United States working class. Canada's federal trade officials have had a long time to consider targeted reprisals. Today they and Mexico's administration began to carry them out. So did the European Union. There will be time before the American mid-term elections for the reprisals to bite.Won't Canada and Mexico Fold About NAFTA?No. NAFTA is a complex agreement that covers trade in many different types of goods and services. It also covers some types of labour mobility among the three countries. A new draft of NAFTA, with all the requisite details, isn't close to being ready. According to both the United States Administration and Congress, it will very soon be too late to continue formal negotiations until after the United States mid-term elections.The United States Administration isn't negotiating with some abstract “Canada”. It is negotiating with the Liberal Party of Canada. They are currently the governing party of Canada.Canada will have a federal election in 2019. The Liberal Party of Canada would very much like to remain in government. If they do anything that could be construed as folding or capitulating, they won't.The current Liberal Prime Minister, Justin Trudeau, has already picked up a reputation as being a little weak and indecisive. He has political vulnerability on that side. He needs to look butch. He has already said that Canada would prefer no deal than a bad deal. If he “stands up” to the Americans, and keeps his word, he will look very butch indeed. Maybe his party will win the 2019 election.The American tariffs will hurt some Canadian steel and aluminum workers, but not enough to have a major effect on the next Canadian federal election. The Liberal Party of Canada has been given an excuse. Within the next few days the pre mid-term negotiating period will come to an end. They won't have to do much about NAFTA negotiations until January of 2019.Of course, Mexico is a month away from its own elections. The Trump Administration inadvertently has been doing its best to elect a Mexican President who will be even more unhappy with the USA than several Mexican Presidents before them.That President will also have an excuse. He knows the American mid-terms are coming up. He won't have to do much, if any, negotiating, until January 2019. In the meantime that President can appeal to his base (or most, of the Mexican population) by railing against Yankee imperialism. Effectively, he wins.So, the Trump Administration's situation is that the NAFTA negotiations will not be concluded. The threats and pressures didn't work. The Mexicans and Canadian administrations will have until January, 2019 to wind up their own electorates and “fortify” them for what happens next.In the meantime, the Trump Administration has started a conflict with the powerful European Union, that they don't need to have. There are already a lot of Europeans looking on the Trump administration with derision and hostility. The top EU trade negotiator stated just a day ago that the Trump Administration is behaving like the “gunfight at the OK Corral”. It's interesting that the Europeans know about the gunfight. The EU is strong enough to shrug off the USA. If they win their complaint to the WTO, they will gloat.In the Mid to Longer TermThe Trump Administration has succeeded in doing something that previous Canadian federal administrations have had the greatest difficulty in doing. They have proven to Canadian manufacturers, service providers and exporters that Canada badly needs to diversify its foreign trade.Canada has recently, with the greatest of difficulty, concluded trade agreements with the European Union countries and the countries of the Trans-Pacific Partnership. I can just see the Liberal Party trade agenda as the 2019 federal election approaches, “Now we have these agreements, so let's use them!.So, Canadians know that there are signifigant new markets out there. They won't totally replace trade with the USA but it creates hope.And, Canadian trade with the USA will continue. We are an excellent market for American goods and services. We have stuff that American want to buy, unless they try to buy them somewhere else, probably from countries whose populations don't like the USA all that much (Maybe they have heard about the gun fight at the OK corral too.) and still want to have friendly chats with the Chinese, the Russians and the Iranians. Since those goods would have to come from farther away, they would cost American companies and consumers more.I don't think Mexico will be much different. They Mexican administration may see negotiating with China, Russia and Iran, as a strategy that will please some very angry Mexicans.Scenarios?Since the tariffs won't work, the Trump Administration will have to make some hard decisions before the mid-terms. They could try more and more tariff and non-tariff barriers against Canada and Mexico. This won't make any difference about NAFTA though, at least until January, 2019. But by then the Canadian federal election will be approaching. Justin Trudeau will have to stay butch and his opponents even butcher.Even Canadians can get get annoyed and resentful. And, we don't know what the results of the American mid-terms will be. Maybe the new Congress will not want to locate the OK corral on the Canadian border. Or else, Justin Trudeau will say, it's over.NAFTA never had unanimous support in Canada. Trade negotiations between Canada and the USA may revert to being issue by issue, as they were to a considerable extent before the 1990's. After a short while, that old normal will become Canada's new normal. The main difference from the old days is that Canadians used to think Americans wanted to bargain in good faith. I don't think those feelings will come back for a long time. Canada will get hurt, but, life, hope and overseas export drives, will go on.Maybe the Mexicans never had that much confidence in negotiations with the USA. They certainly won't now and they have alternatives. The USA may never regain the export markets it had in Mexico.If the Americans mess with the European Union, again, they will have an unpleasant experience. They will have Europeans telling them in French and German, to get lost.For the Americans?There America is, in mid-2019. They haven't been able to get NAFTA concessions out of Canada and Mexico. Either the American administration loses and backs down or they terminate NAFTA. American workers will get that much more hurt, Americans will pay a lot more for imported goods, and the Mexicans and the EU will be having happy chats with countries that most Americans don't like. Maybe even Canada will.I said in a comment a little while ago, the Trump Administration is trying to have its isolationism cake and eat it too. Perhaps it would have been better for the USA, if Donald Trump had fulfilled his original promise to his base, and cancelled NAFTA. Negotiating in bad faith and fantacizing about wins that no foreign administration will allow you, is worse than just not negotiating at all. Maybe Canada and the USA could have gone back to the pre-1990's situation, without rancour, and just dealt with trade issues on a case by case basis. If the USA had simply cancelled NAFTA, Mexico would not have had to suffer through months of negotiating insults and threats. NAFTA has not been in a win for domestic Mexican farmers and probably not for small-scale Mexican manufacturers. They might have been glad to see it gone.Canada and Mexico would have gotten over the cancellation of NAFTA and, after a transitional period, there could have been business as usual.The result of the fractious NAFTA negotiations and the Trump Administration hurling insults and lies, is that the USA will have much more difficulty with their trade relations than otherwise. The USA has lost most of its credibility and they have so politicized the Canadian and Mexican populations, regarding trade with the USA, that it will now be years before trade relations will return to civility.The USA needlessly took on the European Union although there were no pressing negotiations going on. The populations of the EU won't forget it either. Once Russia, China and Iran are seen as more reliable trading partners than the USA, there will be nothing any American administration can do to get them out.We end up with a United States that will be much more marginalized in world trade than it needed to be. American workers will lose overseas markets, and reasonably priced consumer imports, that a more competent American administration could easily have kept.And, none of this will help the coal industry or the vanished Rust Belt industries to come back. It's too late.In the long term, American workers end up behind. Former trade partners will not be able to negotiate freely with the USA, because they have to answer to their own populations, which are angry and distrustful. No good will happen within the USA. Canada, Mexico and the European Union may eventually come out ahead, as they develop close trading relationships with much more reliable trading partners.Martin LevineWhy do members of society feel that they are dominated?May 28, 2018It depends what society you mean. If you live in a brutal, authoritarian dictatorship you have obvious reasons to feel you are being dominated.I wonder if this question could be rephrased as “In different societies, who feels that they are being dominated, and what society do they think they are living in?” It isn't completely clear whether this question is making the affirmative statement that, in any society, most, or virtually all people, feel that they are being dominated.However, “domination” can mean something else beyond domination by the state. Long after women obtained the right to vote, women complained of being dominated in the family and in the workplace. The result was a great deal of change in some families, some change in the workplace and lots of push-back from those who liked things the way they were, or the way they think things were.What Does Domination Mean?The BDSM community could probably offer some insights about this. (I apologize if I am offending anyone who feels uncomfortable about BDSM, which is Bondage, Domination and Sadisto-Masochism.) A key element to BDSM is, how does one resolve consent versus domination? What does domination mean if it is consensual and what is the value of being passively submissive as opposed to the one who is the denominator? Many participators in BDSM want to be dominated. It isn't just sexual pleasure. There are complex issues of “surrendering” a position of authority and being released from the yoke of having to take responsibility, finding a mentor in a relationship, being a member of a community that understands you, and so on.How many people experience some domination in their personal lives and explicitly or tacitly agree to some of it? The 1960's in particular was a time when young, educated people in some industrial countries rebelled against some types of domination, or at least, extreme and gratuitous types of domination where the dominator was doing it out of pride, the desire to defend a social group in which they were a member, or out of plain old sadism. (I am thinking of high school principals I knew of in Winnipeg, who were in modern terms, “ego freaks”, social bigots and simply enjoyed tormenting students they didn't like, and didn't want to be successful.)The issue wasn't, for example, that the teacher wasn't the dominant or primary source of information in the classroom, the issue was the teacher abusing their position to pursue types of domination that they were not entitled to.I would offer the Human Resources sections of some of the positions I have been in as an ideal example, domination with abuse of authority.Dominating the DominatorsI believe that unwanted domination, at least in a society where is some recourse, drives much of whatever divides or changes societies. But, there is a proviso, members of subcultures and some groups that have a social identity imposed on them, may see domination a different way.Again, because I am most familiar with it, I offer my home town, Winnipeg, as an example.My high school was, to a particular extent, ruled by the gym coaches. Most of the young guys liked it. The coaches were dominant and authoritarian in the way the dealt with the kids. But, most of the boys saw them as impressive, as leaders. There was one coach in particular who was highly regarded.I didn't highly regard him highly one bit. I didn't and don't like sports. To me the coach was an abuser, a bully. He represented an ideology that, even at my age, I disliked. It was not that long after World War II. To me this chap was a fascist, source material for Nazism.I did my best at gym but I am physically a little clumsy. We were playing some sort of valueless sport, I think it was volleyball or something, that had next to nothing to do with exercise. I missed catching a ball. The coach slapped me across the chest. I told my parents. They told the principal. Even in the primitive Manitoba of the early 1960's, there was a limit. I was excused from gym class for the rest of my time, at this far less than impressive junior high.To this day I am proud. Were it to happen to my child today I would call the police. Hopefully that coach would be subjected to a criminal conviction and never be allowed to work again.Another example, Christmas as an exercise in domination. It still isn't the best now, but in those days Christmas was an exercise in triumphalism. Christmas music dominated the airwaves but it went beyond that. Christmas was presented as an ideology, the supposed triumph of Jesus Christ over what had come before, that is, us. (From what I understand about Jesus Christ now, if he existed. he hadn't the least desire to dominate anyone and never suggested that he was creating a brand new religion to dominate over the vanquished Judaism.) Christmas was an extra Easter with your favourite villain thrown in, us.I am not suggesting that people who believe in and look forward to Christmas should be deterred from celebrating it. However the bigots and sadists of Manitoba used the holiday as an attempt at domination, that is social denigration and exclusion against Jewish Manitobans. The holiday still makes me grit my teeth.The lesson: One person's idea of leadership, of justifiable control, is easily some other person's non-consensual, unjust domination. If we truly believe in a democratic society, we need to take responsibility for the domination inflicted on others. It doesn't matter if you think that a leader or leadership group is doing something acceptable for most people, it's still wrong.Domination When You Don't Know or Don't CareCan an influencer be a denominator? What about commercials? Their message is, you are valuable only when you buy stuff. They also aggressively promote some lifestyles as better than others. In Canada I call it the hockey-beer complex. The good life is watching hockey on TV, eating fried chicken wings and drinking very large amounts of beer. This is advertisers exercising domination by means of brain washing.There aren't going to be commercials pointing out, that watching very highly paid professional hockey players, who will go to any city where the team franchise will pay them a lot, is meaningless to your personal life. Even social service advertisements don't want to take the National Hockey League and the beer companies on, They are not going to say, those fried chicken wings will make you sick, so will a lot of beer and the beer makes you much more likely to get into bar fights and beat up on your spouse or domestic partner. Commercial propaganda is a powerful means of domination.Then, Is It State Domination or Who Is Using the State to Dominate Whom?I notice it in Quora. In Canada there is something of a consensus about what federal and provincial governments are meant to do. Those governments do some redistribution of income, some protection of individuals and groups from domination that has no reasonable explanation, and try to give everyone a little bit of accommodation. However maybe it isn't seen quite the same way in the USA.Of course, in either Canada or the USA , politicians and those who advise them rather frequently use their powerful positions as an ego trip and guarantee that they will get a nice, secure pension.The issue in the USA sometimes seem to be a strong disagreement about what dominance means and who gets to do it to whom.I have heard the argument, no state redistribution of income is justifiable. Politicians and bureaucrats who use their authority to force it on me are abusing their authority and violating my wrights.Or, when the authorities fail to control groups, that in my view are dangerous, that are engaging in unjust social denomination by refusing to do what it is their duty to do. They are discriminating against me. They are allowing sexual and racial minorities to exercise power over my life.Or, when the police use their power to single out Afro-Americans and to conduct unjustified violence against them, the rights and pride of our police officers are superior to that of any complaining racial group.But then, we see the converse as well. What happens when a university anti-discrimination unit decides that any opposition, to what they deem as political correct, needs to be suppressed and punished, to be driven off campus? What happens, when a group that purports to represent a racial minority, attempts to use street violence to obstruct the police, and then claims it is justified, and that anyone who disagrees with them is a racist, or a member of their own group who is a traitor or a hopeless dupe?I would characterize all these behaviours as a grab for the power brass ring, an assertion of a right to dominate and not be questioned.It is that sports coach in the Manitoba of my youth. I am powerful. I am fierce. I have the right to dominate you without question. I am not accountable.I Am Dominated, You Not So MuchAs I said, there are countries where almost everybody is under the heel of authoritarians who dominate with impunity.For the rest of us, look at nuance. Be on guard for unwanted BDSM. Ask yourself, are other people in your society being dominated right before you? Do you think it is justified? How would you feel if you were in their shoes?I stand by what I said. That sports coach might not have had a clue about what fascism is, but he partook of the philosophy, quite instinctively. He had concluded, that he was invariably right. He was empowered to state who were useful boys or who were the useless ones. He hadn't the least concept of empathy, except maybe for people who were just like himself. He felt he was entitled to use physical violence to impose his views.There are still lots of people like that. They form groups to enforce their views and attempt to gain dominance. They have far less regard for consent than your average BDSM'er. These are the most dangerous dominators in a democratic society. They need to be resisted, always. They need to be told how bad they are.Martin LevineWhy do some liberals dislike people who gained their fortune and social status by wisdom, courage, knowledge, and striving laboriously?May 22, 2018I note that this Question uses the adjective “some”, not “all”. This helps me accept the question as a legitimate one.As usual I am best qualified to talk about Canada.So, What Is a Liberal, Nowadays?There isn't any standard definition of what a liberal is. Canada has Liberal Parties, both at the federal and provincial levels. (of course the federal one is currently the government.) But not everyone who sees themselves as liberal is a member of a Liberal Party. Also, in Canada, a fair number of people who might self-identify as liberal, support the New Democratic Party, federally or provincially. The NDP is usually somewhat to the “left” of the Liberal Parties, but not always. The NDP tends to adjust their policies depending upon who the leader is, who the leading personalities in the party are, and also while they are trying to win elections.There are a few other terms being misutilized to describe just who a liberal might be. Being a liberal isn't synonymous with being progressive or being socialist or communism-inclined. Sometimes, in Canada, the term liberal is used as a catch-all for the many individuals in society who are not fond of ideologies and extreme positions, don't relate much to strongly-political personalities, don't want the boat of the Canadian social safety net to be rocked and, if anything, are kind of status quo oriented. I suspect there are a whole lot of Canadians like this.Being Liberal in Government Can Be A StretchIn any developed industrial democracy, liberal attitudes need to get activated in the form of social programmes. The process is, liberal-minded attitudes, get the policy makers to translate those attitudes into identifiable policies, then get specialists to develop the corresponding social programmes and then, if you are government, implement them.However, then the naivety and lack of realism can quickly kick in. Generally, you need experts to develop the policies and even more experts to develop the programmes. Those experts may be less expert than they believe themselves to be and would like anybody else to think. Pride takes over and the policy and programme makers get down in a crouch. Taxpayer interests, test piloting a programme, and accepting that an audit may find it next to useless, are a hard sell. Bureaucratic capture can happen and the well-intentioned liberal with a good attitude doesn't even find out.If you are a liberal, and you see government policy and programme development as a well-intentioned black box from which good things will flow, you don't necessarily want to be told anything otherwise.What Happens When the World, and Quite a Few of the People In It, Are Tough, Dishonest, Devious and Mean?I mentioned in an Answer recently, that people frequently tend, either intentionally or unintentionally, to take up a stance in the world. Some of the liberal stance is what I have described above. The world can be a good place, where good things can happen and things, and people, can improve.That stance is a large part of what makes your world tolerable. It gives you hope and a cognitive scheme about life. It makes you like and trust other people who you haven't even met.But, sadly this happy, satisfying stance is readily subject to challenge. Even I, as a sort of lefty-progressive type alien foreigner, have to acknowledge it. Yes, some people will be very grateful for the social programme that is meant to help them. They will see it as a hand up. They will work really hard. But there are going to be signifigant numbers of people who have no interest in changing and will work the system.I see them even in Ottawa, a city with good social services and a lot of people who want to offer that hand up. Here is a primary principle in the liberal stance, people who can work really want to. Give them special accommodation, give them special education, give them counselling, and they will take it and run with it.But, I have met plenty enough people in Ottawa who are not in the conventional labour force and don't want to be. When you think about it, regular working life in Ottawa is tough, despite all the social-liberal amenities. How do you convince yourself that it is good to wake up at 6:00 a.m. on a January morning, when the temperature is -30 C. and there is a stiff wind? Then, you freeze at the bus stop, then when you get to work your boss is a monster, the pay hardly worth the trouble, and taxes are high.So, say you can combine some welfare, together with some under the counter work, and a little bit of drug dealing, and get yourself an adequate income. Better even if you qualify for disability payments, because the rates are higher. You work at not getting undisabled.Take it to the extreme. Committing crimes can be exciting and profitable. Ottawa's jails are full. The judges don't want to overcrowd them even worse. Even if you are in jail you get your three square meals there. That criminal record means that you are unlikely to qualify for a whole lot of jobs, even if you wanted one. You have a good chance at parole and you know that Ottawa doesn't have enough parole officer and police time to crack the whip.And, sometimes people take drugs because it feels really good. That good feeling is way better than being a nightshift security guard at Ontario minimum wage.Sometimes, this type of life can be happier and more fulfilling than a regular job.However, tell a well-intentioned liberal that, and they are likely to rebel. Tell them that these sorts of folks are draining away precious resources from people who really want to get better. Unless they are realistic, their worldview has been violated. In Canada liberal-minded people tend to be middle class. The conservative critic is telling them about a world they may not ever have seen.Not Liberal, LiberalsPrancing LiberalsIt so often feels really good to strike the pose. The USA used to have a term, “limousine liberals”. Sometimes they weren't all that liberal and were telling the government, don't spend my money on the problem, spend someone else's. I sort of see them as prancing liberals.Go Away and Don't Bother Me LiberalsI see Americans in Quora and elsewhere imaging Canada as the ultimate “bleeding heart” country. We Canadians all just love the disadvantaged so much.No, that is far from being necessarily the case. What your Canadian is sometimes saying, (although it is not Canadian nice to admit it) is that I want that socially troubled person to go away and get out of my sight.And no, I am not pointing my arrogant Canadian finger at the USA, but Canadians get saturation media coverage of America's social problems. We see horrible ghettos, very large numbers of homeless people, vastly deficient schools that can't push a student as far as high school graduation, people with no health care, etc.Those people tend to get in a middle-class American's face. They get hostile. They blame you for their problems. They rebel and being extremely poor, steal. They fight with the police. They overload the limited amounts of available no pay health care.A lot of Canadians dearly don't want anyone in their face. Pay them off! Make sure they have full doctor and hospital care. Give them non-ghetto subsidized housing. Give them that welfare, give them those disability payments, give their kids decent, non-ghetto schools. Tell the police to go easy and be conciliatory. And then, us middle class Canadian folks can live in peace.I'm In it for the Bucks LiberalsSocial programming is excellent for those who want a good secure administrative job with really good benefits. There are going to be a fair number of people who know that really well. Career, pride and money, complete self-orientation, is going to be well out front of doing good.Wisdom, courage, knowledge, and striving laboriously?As the Question states, some liberals have a problem with people who got where they did because of the above. Some, definitely not all.I believe being overcommitted to a certain variant of a liberal life stance can cause these human characteristics to be devalued.If you won't recognize that some people are happy to abuse the system, whether they are recipients of social benefits, or people making good money off of administering social programmes, the role of wisdom, courage, knowledge and striving can fade out of your mind.If you manifest your supposed liberalism by demanding, not just disbursement programmes, but affirmative action and equity ones, with a generous overdose of political correctness, how well are you going to respond when someone says, no, your programmes are ill conceived because:-Wisdom exists and matters a lot. You can't quantify it or redistribute it. There is no social programme you can devise for that.-You can't do it with courage either. You can't use a social programme to make someone courageous, you are, or you aren't.-Getting knowledge is a type of hard work, and a willingness to learn things that you didn't necessarily want to hear. You need knowledge to succeed. If you are not willing to work at it, nothing can be a substitute.-Striving is a trait and some people don't have it. Some of them are pretty good at disguising the fact that they don't want to strive at anything. How can a social programme teach them the zest for striving?Some, Not AllOf course there are plenty of liberal-intentioned Canadians who know the above. They won't be shocked when a conservative expresses what are really facts, even though they might be reluctant to admit they agree.But then, there are the some liberals who have turned their liberal stance into a self-interested intoxicant. Like anyone else with certain views, they need to deny certain realities to stay proud, prosperous and happy.For liberalism to really do good in the world, really liberal people need to have a certain type of courage. They have to prepared to stand and say, facts matter, you are ignoring them. You are letting precious resources be drained out of the social safety net, causing suffering for people who need help, and who would try to do their best if they got it.Martin LevineHow prevalent is classism in Canada?May 5, 2018I believe that Canada is very classist, but in a special sort of way. Social class is enforced here by denying the existence of any class but the middle class. The current federal government augments this by going on about how their primary aim is to help the middle class and people who would like to get into the middle class. Those people who aren't in the middle class are not named. Presumably they are simply poor people.This does not describe Canadian reality. If working class is meant to be “blue collar” there are working class in people in Canada. By no means are all of them poor. Some of them are unionized, some are skilled trades people, some of them own their own businesses.If one wanted to emphasize poverty as a feature of being working class, there are a lot of white collar workers who are poor. You certainly see it here in Ottawa. Nowadays the federal government relies a lot on temporary, employment agency workers to get through its workload. They get paid the Ontario minimum wage, CAD14 an hour. That won't get you far in Ottawa!Then there's the other end of the equation, the rich people of Canada. Calling someone with a multimillion dollar income and all the accouterments, middle class, verges on social silliness.Being Taken Care Of Isn't The Same As Being Middle-classCanada has some good social programming and a social safety net. This can help people who are working-class or maybe poor white collar. However that net doesn't turn you into a member of the middle class. It just makes your life less dire.So, Where Is Is The Harm?At one time, unions were stronger in Canada then they are today. This was before the loss of so much of Canada's traditional industrial base. Those unionized jobs were a man's world. Formal education didn't so much matter. There used to be talk of a working class.However the jobs went away. Canada shifted to being much more of a service economy. So many of those jobs were filled by women.I think that is when the self-identifying Canadian working class died out. It did not help that the old Co-operative Commonwealth Federation, which was strongly union-based, was replaced by the New Democratic Party, so much the preserve of academics, social activists and aggrieved members of ethnic minorities. These were not people who were well placed to define and describe the interests of the working class.So, Who Represents The People Below The Middle ClassWell, that's a very serious problem. Maybe the Ford family?Pretending that the amorphous group of people, who are supposedly below the middle class, are just people who want to join the middle class is damaging. Maybe they don't want to. These people didn't create the housing price disaster in Vancouver and Toronto. They didn't cause the type of globalization that has weakened Canada's labor market. They aren't responsible for the endless wrangling over infrastructural projects, so often driven by economically secure upper middle class people, that result in jobs not happening.This Canadian under class won't disappear into the middle class. Not even the federal government can force people to have “middle class values”.If only populists and demagogues are ready to accept these Canadians as they are, then we will have a Canada that is tilted towards anger and authoritarianism. Effectively, we will end up with the social class conflict we thought couldn't happen here.Classes Within ClassesA sociologist will tell you that the middle class is not all of a piece. Traditionally they spoke of the lower, middle and upper middle classes.In Canada, for reasons that I have discussed in other Answers, the upper middle class speaks very loudly. Partly it's the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation. Partly it's because of powerful and self-protective senior civil servants. Partly it's because of the concentration of social and economic power in Toronto and Montreal. Partly because, more and more, it requires high levels of knowledge and education to do really well in Canada. But, I think also, much of the middle class is laden with high housing costs, debt, the decline of for-life, secure, office jobs and the decline of secure, fixed benefit pensions. The upper middle-class is best positioned to override this stress and keep on talking.Not surprisingly, since so many national media commentators are upper middle class, we don't hear much about this representation problem.It's Easier to Be Upper Class When People Don't Notice You Are ThereIf you got it don't flaunt ItMaybe it is because of the traditional Canadian dislike of fripperies. Presbyterianism and Methodism did a lot to set culture in English-speaking Canada. Also, the Roman Catholic Church in Quebec wasn't known for jollity. The Canadian upper class knows how not to be in people's faces. I think also they have seen from Britain and Europe that too much visibility provokes resentment and jealousy. So let's not have any Canadian Beverly Hills, no Canadian Palm Beach.But the upper class is still there, still exercising its powers and its own interests.Of course, the upper class has quite considerable control over the main stream media. How many commentators really want to identify and criticize them?My concern is that the current Canadian situation, a very classist society that insists it only has one class, is a bad situation that appears to be causing social deterioration. Someone in authority needs to say, the working class exists and they won't go away. They have their own issues which need to be addressed.It needs to be admitted, economically secure upper middle class people are doing a lot of the talking. It also needs to be said, Canada has a strong upper class. They defend their own interests very well. It isn't wrong to acknowledge their existence and consider, what they are doing, and how does it effect the rest of the population.Martin LevineWhy is the western civilization & culture dying out?May 2, 2018I don't think it is, to the extent one can define “western” civilization and culture.In terms of “western”, where does the West stop? Japan and Taiwan have high living living standards, post-industrial economies and democratic governments with high levels of personal freedom. They are not Christian or White though.The Elements of “Western”Maybe a useful way to look at it, is to break out some of the characteristics that are commonly ascribed to western civilization and culture:-Democratic governments-Civil and human rights for the individual-Fully-developed economies that generate a reasonable level of prosperity for most of the population.-Relative equality for women-A Christian heritage but not a Christian theocracy or any theocracy-CaucasiannessSome of these ascriptions haven't been essential to being a Western civilization and for a long-time.CaucasiannessA large and growing proportion of the population of the United States is not white. Is there some tipping point where the proportion of non-white residents is so much that the civilization and culture of the USA would be overthrown?This doesn't seem all that likely. Many non-Caucasian Americans have been Americans for many generations, especially the Afro-American community. It isn't evident that Afro-Americans have a scheme to end western culture in the USA. In fact, American civilization and culture would be very different from what it is without the Afro-American contribution.In order to overthrow American culture, one particular ethnocultural group or coalition of groups would have to have some sort of plan. They would have to have a scheme to end democracy and civil and human rights, destroy the American economy, ban any observance of Christianity, force American women into a subservient position and so on. They would also have to have the power to do it, economic, military and/or political. They could resort to terrorism but, despite so many attacks over the years, terrorism hasn't been effective in intimidating civilizations into disbanding. Rather, the countries that represent those civilizations and cultures simply incur costs, attacking the source of the terrorists, operating security and intelligence agencies, placing radioactivity and explosive sensors at ports of entry, putting up concrete barriers to forestall vehicle attacks, etc.Linguistic Overthrow of Western Civilization and CultureIn the USA and some other countries this appears to be a theme, legal and/or illegal immigrants who speak a language other that country's current official language, usurping that official language either by numbers or by law.Part of this concern is a certain, somewhat buried assumption, that unilingualism is an essential characteristic of any given Western country. However, this assumption would delete Canada, Switzerland and Belgium right out of the West. Even the United Kingdom provides substantial recognition to the Celtic languages that have been a part of what is now the United Kingdom since time immemorial.A prime example of this concern, is the fear of some Americans that immigrants from Latin America will overcome English, and force acceptance of Spanish as a second official language across the USA or maybe the only official language. Maybe, deeper down, there is the assumption that Spanish-speaking migrants to the USA would prefer an authoritarian dictatorship, with a strong element of Roman Catholic religious law. This isn't at all clear.Spanish is the official language of what one would normally consider to be a European country, Spain. Even if the immigrants spoke a language considered as non-western, would they bring a non-western civilization and cultural agenda with them? What, for example, if a lot of Mandarin speakers immigrated to the USA? Would their speaking of Mandarin be a tacit endorsement of the policies of the Communist Party of the People's Republic of China and an attempt to force those policies on the USA?Western Religions Aren't What They Used to BeSome western countries haven't been all that religious for quite a long time. Some of the western European countries endorse secularism as their official ideology. Religious observance in the United Kingdom isn't what it used to be, nor is it in Canada.One could make the argument that non-western immigrants might try to impose a non-western religion on different western countries. Most commonly Islam is perceived as the big threat. However, if that is the intention of Muslim immigrants, there just aren't enough of them to pull it off. It would have to be some Muslim country attacking, invading and conquering a western country and forcing its inhabitants to convert to Islam. Chances are the people in that attacked country, and allied countries, would defend themselves. Several of the prime targets have nuclear arsenals.Economic DeclineThis is a concern that might be real. What happens if the economy of a given country deteriorates to a level where most of the population are poor. Is it still a western country? We have seen countries, that were almost at the prosperous level, decline and slide back. What if the economy of Argentina had not slid into corruption, stagnation and, poverty for much of the Argentinean population? Argentina has a democratic system of government. It has a Christian heritage but the Roman Catholic Church is not politically dominant. The status of women has improved. Again, Spanish is a western language. Would Argentina be a western country, not a high-end Third World one?Containment, Friendly or OtherwiseSo, am I saying that new arrivals in a western country are no threat at all to the civilization and culture of that country? No, not completely. Some of them will be opposed to democracy and believe in theocracy. They may oppose civil and human rights. They may be strongly opposed to equality for women. They might resort to political action. Some of them might resort to breaking the law and terrorism.However, the different western countries seem to have developed some ways of containing this threat. There seem to be two different methods, encapsulation and rejection, or some variant of multiculturalism.I lived in Austria for three years. Austria is a prosperous country with a democratic system of government. Partly because Austria is prosperous and has a good social safety net, “old-stock” Austrians don't really have to take so many of the country's less pleasant jobs. Austria, like Germany, relies on “Gastarbeiters” (Guest Workers), workers from Turkey, Egypt but also the countries of the former Yugoslavia, for this type of labour.However, most of these workers are not “Gasts” anymore. They are multi decade residents of Austria, their Austrian born children and even Austrian-born grandchildren.The Austrians have drawn a very clear line in the sand, as have some other European countries. Your culture is never going to be part of Austrian culture. We will never accept you as real Austrians unless you drop all elements of your original culture and assimilate, to the very maximum that you can do, into our culture. Then, the non-racist Austrians among us will accept you as Austrians.So, these “Gastarbeiters” could work at becoming totally assimilated. Or, they will live in a separate silo all their lives. This usually involves some ghettoization. There is a little bit of a gray area. For example you dress like a local European but still teach your children your heritage language. However, it doesn't go very far.Then there's that Canadian classic, multiculturalism with a cheery smile. However, as I have said in a few Answers, multiculturalism is very definitely about drawing a line with those who are not accepting of “Western” Canadian norms. Multiculturalism gives you a considerable amount of scope in your personal life, without Canadian society decrying you as a person that should not be here. However, there are sharp constraints. No recognition of religious courts, no exemptions from provincial educational curricula, no exemption from family and child welfare law, no acceptance of religious customs that are illegal in Canada, no more official languages, no declaring of non-Christian holidays as official ones, no exemption from municipal zoning bylaws, even about where a place of worship can be located. All will play by the same rules. There will be no violation of political correctness and hate speech is criminal, no matter who says it.Both approaches encapsulate those who are non-western in their beliefs and attitudes. Both approaches protect the civilization and culture of the Western country concerned.The Edge of the WestI have already mentioned Japan and Taiwan. Are they Western?Then, there's Israel. A democratic system. (Yes, even the substantial number of Arab citizens have the right to vote and have civil and human rights.)Israel is prosperous at the western level.However, modern Israel doesn't have much of a Christian heritage. The official language is Hebrew. Given the role of the scriptures in the Christian western world, is Hebrew a western language?One could make a point about Israel's occupation of the Palestinian territories. However, Israel doesn't claim most of that territory for itself. They remain as occupied territories, with people who certainly do not aspire to Israeli civilization and culture. Israel is not trying to convince them otherwise.Then, what about Argentina, and also Uruguay, Chile and maybe Barbados and Trinidad and Tobago. What if they made that last economic push and reached at least the low end of First World prosperity? Are they automatically admitted into the western club?The Threat from Within?Without sounding McCarthyite, there is a real issue about the threat to western civilization and culture from within. In any given western country, there are those who do not agree with democracy, want theocratic elements in government, do not believe in equality for women, other religions, other races, etc. The social media have made their existence more obvious and help them to recruit and organize. That could be a real threat.Can't There Be Non-Western State Challengers?Russia, the People's Republic of China and India aren't generally considered Western.Russia has shown how the social media can be used to attack western democratic elections. Maybe the People's Republic of China will too. India, probably not. They have no motivation.These sorts of attacks are probably more serious than anything immigrants could possibly do.So, there certainly needs to be vigilance. But, one needs to understand what western culture and civilization currently is, not what it used to be. And, while ethnocultural migrations are seen by some as the greatest threat, other threats are worse.Martin LevineWhy is cultural appropriation frowned upon? If it's good-natured, is it not a sign of respect and flattery?April 30, 2018I think there is a little bit of vagueness about what cultural appropriation means.Wikipedia has this to say at: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cu...“Cultural appropriation is a concept in sociology dealing with the adoption of the elements of a minority culture by members of the dominant culture. It is distinguished from equal cultural exchange due to the presence of a colonial element and imbalance of power. Cultural appropriation is often portrayed as harmful in contemporary cultures, and is claimed to be a violation of the collective intellectual property rights of the originating, minority cultures, notably indigenous cultures and those living under colonial rule. Often unavoidable when multiple cultures come together, cultural appropriation can include using other cultures' cultural and religious traditions, fashion, symbols, language, and songs.According to critics of the practice, cultural appropriation differs from acculturation, assimilation, or cultural exchange in that this appropriation is a form of colonialism: cultural elements are copied from a minority culture by members of a dominant culture, and these elements are used outside of their original cultural context—sometimes even against the expressly stated wishes of members of the originating culture.”This is a very diligent attempt at a comprehensive definition but there are still things that are hard to interpret.-What are dominant and minority cultures?-What is a colonial element?-What is an equal cultural exchange?-How do you identify a power imbalance?-Is there such a thing as collective intellectual property rights?-Do cultural elements belong to a particular culture only?Stealing Ideas Isn't The Same as Stealing PropertyThe concept of cultural appropriation seems an attempt to equate attempts to copy elements of a culture, that has been subjected to colonialism, to the actual theft of the physical property of colonized peoples, their land, their possessions, their physical resources and their religious and artistic artifacts. However, when one copies a cultural element one isn't stealing it. The minority culture still has that element. “Appropriation” seems to suggest stealing. However, if the dominant culture of my Province of Manitoba (British-origin Canadians) takes to eating bagels, us Jewish Winnipegers still have, our bagels. The British-Canadian people didn't actually steal our kosher bagel bakery and deprive us Jews of our bagels. In fact, the bakery with the best kosher bagels in town (They are excellent but I know you can't use Quora to promote a business.) is still there, as it was in the 1950's, before non-Judeo-Manitobans ever founded out what a bagel was.Us Jews of Winnipeg were certainly a rather disempowered minority culture in Manitoba. In fact the power imbalance was massive. However, when non-Judeo-Manitobans began to eat bagels, starting more or less in the 1960's, we really did not feel a sense of outrage. There was some bewilderment on our part and kind of a community head scratch.Of course there could be a feedback loop for the minority culture that might be perceived as negative. Think of the Dubliners having to dye the Liffey River green for Saint Patrick's Day.A nastier situation would be, the demand that the kosher bakery in Winnipeg shut down because the supermarkets of Manitoba want to monopolize the bagel business. There is the reality that the bagels from the kosher bakery put all the imitations to shame. However, vigilance is needed!Or, I could indulge in an old Jew's cultural flip out, and insist that placing bacon strips in our sacred bagel is a deliberate slap in the face. However, if I started reciting my theory at any synagogue in Winnipeg, the response from much of the congregation would probably be something to the effect of, stop whining, finish your praying and then go out and get a life!An Equal Cultural ExchangeWhen do different cultures conduct a structured exchange of cultural traits, based on reciprocity? How would this happen? Presumably two official bodies would have to represent the dominant and minority cultures. They would have to sit down in a formal negotiation session, presumably supported by well-paid staffs of lawyers. Of course it would have to be something like trade negotiations and there would have to be equivalences. So, the Winnipeg Jewish community (fortunately not in the least short on lawyers) would have to sit down with the British Canadian Dominant Cultural Organization of Manitoba. We might say, our favourite bagel recipe is worth 100 season tickets for the Winnipeg Blue Bombers. Just give us the tickets and don't ask just how we are going to distribute them. And, if you want after sales service on that bagel recipe, like how to bake them right, that's going to cost you another 100 tickets.Original ContextThe original context concern could apply, but it depends. Putting bacon strips in your morning, fast food bagel breakfast, certainly uses them outside of their original context. However, other than giving me a chance to throw hysterics at my local synagogue, how much does anybody care?However, there are situations where original context definitely matters. Wearing a cheap copy of a First Nations head dress to a Winnipeg Jets game definitely uses that head dress outside of its original context, in a disrespectful and offensive way. That head dress is a ceremonial vestment that belongs to a very dignified context in First Nations culture. It is not appropriate for some drunken fan to abuse it in order to support the home team and maybe get a two-second clip on the late night edition of Winnipeg CBC TV news. An original head dress hasn't been stolen (as opposed to those that have already been stolen), but it's wrong, and needlessly exacerbates one of the worst problems in Manitoban society.Individuals Tend to Do Most of the Appropriation, Not the Entire Dominant CultureIn colonialism, one country with superior military technology and a high level of organization physically attacks another. They send their military forces to invade the country, attack the local population and defeat whatever military resistance that country can raise. Then they establish an authoritarian administration, where officials from the dominant country come to rule the subjugated one. Local people who resist are jailed, tortured and murdered.Presuming the attacking culture represents one culture, then, that culture is invading and conquering the culture of the subjugated country. In a sense, the subjugated culture becomes a minority culture in the sense of being defeated and disempowered.However, cultural appropriation isn't typically a country-level effort to exploit another culture. Individuals or businesses in the presumably dominant culture copy elements of the minority culture. The colonial oppression model is not an appropriate one in order to consider the situation.My boorish hockey fan isn't carrying out a dominant culture oppression plan. They are simply an individual boor, seeking attention. Whatever company made the cheap copy of the head dress isn't operationalizing a state sponsored oppression plan. In all likelihood the cheap copy wasn't made in Canada. It's a commercial product likely produced by a manufacturer in another country and culture. The Canadian wholesaler and the retailers are not implementing a cultural appropriation programme dictated by the Department of Cultural Appropriation of the Government of Manitoba. They, on their own, think they have found some way to make money.Say a scriptwriter for a popular music video decides to appropriate some cultural element from another culture, to make the video more entertaining and saleable. Sometimes Japanese culture gets raided. So they throw in some images from kabuki theatre and sumo wrestling to spice the video up, often gratuitously.However, no one has actually gone to Japan, stolen a kabuki theatre and physically transported it to Hollywood. It there are Japanese-origin actors in the video, chances are they are voluntary paid performers, not dragooned slaves.Also, the video is copying cultural elements from a prosperous country with a big consumer market and quite a lot of cultural stability. That video is not likely to do much if any damage to the culture of Japan or the self-esteem of Japanese people. It is unlikely the images would fall under a Japanese copyright. If they did, someone in Japan would probably have the resources to sue whoever produced the video.What is really reprehensible, is when individuals and entrepreneurs appropriate cultural elements from a minority culture, where the members of that culture are too poor to sue. It is worse where the individual or entrepreneur knows that the appropriation is likely to humiliate and demean the vulnerable people of that culture, or couldn't be bothered to even think about it.Collective Intellectual Property Rights?Maybe this should exist but, for the most part, it doesn't. Property rights really means something you can own and maybe copyright. Intellectual property is a recognized concept for an individual or a company. It is possible to copyright an artistic creation. However a “culture” cannot own or copyright anything. An individual or company that owns and copyrights something may feel that they are doing so on behalf of a culture, but is not the same. A cultural element cannot simply be the property of a culture.So, Do I Believe Cultural Appropriation is Trivial and Unimportant?No, I don't, but the colonial or neo-colonial models don't help to understand the problem.Take my boorish Jets fan. There may be remedies but, currently, collective intellectual property is likely to fail as an argument.-Maybe the City of Winnipeg needs to make periodic, additional public statements, repudiating this type of behaviour and reminding fans of the damage it does.-At a certain level human rights legislation and case law could kick in. At what point does doing this sort of thing become harrassment of an identifiable group of people, those First Nations who originated the head dress?-Multicultural and human rights organizations could initiate a Manitoba or Canada-wide dialogue and take their issues to the media.-Assisting a cultural minority, made up mostly of poor people, so that they can conduct a lawsuit and campaign for additional legislation, might be a righteous thing to do.-And, maybe there is a need for new legislation. Could the concept of “collective cultural property” be brought into law?Yes, there are real issues around cultural appropriation. However the colonization model verges on being irrelevant. Also, collective intellectual property rights cannot be wished into being.Martin LevineWhy are intelligent people often lonely?April 29, 2018This question could be broken out a bit more. Of course the first supposition is that intelligent people are lonely. Then there's a comparative aspect. Intelligent compared to whom? Lonely, compared to whom?Maybe, underlying this question, are several others:Are intellectual people lonely?Are introspective people lonely?Are reserved, non expressive, introverted people lonely?Here are some definitions from the Merriam-Westerner dictionary, at Dictionary by Merriam-Webster: America's most-trusted online dictionary, about the above. Of course all of the definitions are the property of the dictionary:Definition of intelligent1 a : having or indicating a high or satisfactory degree of intelligence and mental capacityb : revealing or reflecting good judgment or sound thought : skillful2 a : possessing intelligenceb : guided or directed by intellect : rationalDefinition of intellectual1 a : of or relating to the intellect or its useb : developed or chiefly guided by the intellect rather than by emotion or experience : rationalc : requiring use of the intellect intellectual games2 a : given to study, reflection, and speculationb : engaged in activity requiring the creative use of the intellect intellectual playwrightsDefinition of introspective: characterized by examination of one's own thoughts and feelings : thoughtfully reflective : employing, marked by, or tending to introspection As a student, he was very quiet and introspective.… encouraging a balance between the fast, upbeat songs and a band's more introspective side. —David T. LindsayThere's an interesting literature that suggests that when people are sad, they tend to pay attention to themselves. They become withdrawn and introspective and very aware of their body and their mind and not very aware of the external world. —Peter SaloveyDefinition of reserved1 : restrained in words and actions2 : kept or set apart or aside for future or special useDefinition of introverted: having or suggesting the characteristics of an introvert; especially : possessing a reserved or shy nature typically with an inclination to solitudeIt frustrates and pains me to hear so many stories about how misunderstood and overlooked most introverted people felt when they were growing up. —Marti Olsen Laney—compare to extrovertedThere is something of an interlock between these five different sets of definitions. You can see a sort of human type of emerging. A person with high-end thinking abilities, coupled with a life based on an attempt at rationality, not emotions, introverted and not very sociable and not expressive.Character Types Go In and Out of FashionPeople my age and older may remember a type of social presentation that was very popular in the 1950's. This was the horn-rimmed glasses, formal business suit, unemotional, discursive, professorial type of guy. These were exclusively males and almost always white. You can still see the old instructional films on the Internet. A gentleman of this type, sitting at a bulky wooden desk, discoursing in a deliberate, rational sounding way, about some topic. A relevant example, Control Your Emotions:Actually, in this example, the professorial guy is not wearing horn rims. However he is wearing a distinctly 1950's pair of glasses. I think he is wearing a men's formal, white jacket, instead of a lab coat. Nevertheless he's got the style cold.Control your emotions, yes! It still resonates with me.Typically, when you were about to make a critical point, what later became a bullet in a PowerPoint presentation, you momentarily took your glasses off and then hit your audience with your moral-rational punchline. You would explain why Communism results from personal failings, like a fear of honest work and a Christian family lifestyle, and why the somewhat related male homosexuality was the result of a domineering, overprotective mother, plus a lack of sports training in childhood. Encouragingly, both could be cured by psychotherapy.So, how did these guys have a social life? Maybe in the staff room at the university or at the Protestant church of their choice.However, in those days of well-established gender-specific roles, it was the responsibility of the professor's housewife to be the emotion holder, ideal for a woman because of their limited intellectual capabilities. You could send the Little Woman out to socialize.I apologize for the tinge of nostalgia in this description.We Need Updated Horn-Rims For the Twenty-First CenturyThen, the hippies happened. Then, the self-satisfying yuppies and then the era of big hugs and the man bun.Now we lack a self-presentation style for guys who mostly think, or think they are thinking, aren't all that in touch with whatever other emotions they might be able to squeeze out and, just don't do big hugs. And then we have those women who really just don't have much in the way of domestic desires and get off on statistics and articles from Science Daily.The intellectual, not seething with passions, no I don't want to vent and I don't need yours either, self-presentation, has almost become the new, reprehensible lifestyle of our era, sort of a replacement for that good, old fashioned, evil Communo-homosexuality. Young, dance club women look at you fearfully. The guys with backward baseball caps see you as a personal insult. If you are older, the grandmother-aged women of your generation want so much to share their emotions about their grandchildren. Show them that you can't emphasize and they will head for the hills.Then there's that office. They want bonding and team building. You are surrounded by milennials who see their job time as hook-up heaven. Introversion and introspection turn into a disciplinary issue.When Do Friendships Become Obnoxious?So much of life is based on not thinking. It's not just intellectual laziness. It's because, without dreams and illusions, people can't live.Generally, you don't have to do too much thinking. An orderly daily life carries you on. Get up, make breakfast, walk to the bus stop, work, walk to the bus stop, go home. On the weekend shopping in your grubbies and your favourite sports bar.What if you started thinking about this? The barren, frozen bus stop two hundred kilometres south of the edge of subarctic Canada. The job means an abusive manager and no promotions, ever. When you get home your spouse has just come home from an equally unsatisfying job and is in no mood for family warmth. The bills to pay for your house in the suburbs, etc.If you were to start thinking too much about this you could render yourself distinctly unhappy, no team player, no joy at a hockey victory by the Ottawa Senators, no unrestricted faith that a Conservative Party majority government will resolve all problems.Your doubts will seep out to your facial expressions and body language. Your bros will quickly notice the change. They won't be your bros anymore.But, in reverse, you will know that your bros don't want to do much thinking. Their emotions are too often about false things. It doesn't matter whether the Senators win or not. It's just a sports game. And your bros don't want to know, look out your car window and your suburb has precious little going for it. Do your own thinking a little more and you can end up asking, why do I have friends like this?How Much Thinking Do We Need?If I had bros they might ask me, why think when you don't have to?Particularly in a well-off industrial democracy with an adequate social safety net, you can get by without needing to think all that much. You don't need to think about daily survival. The social safety net reduces the social problems you might feel compelled to think about.However, if you have a relatively high intellectual capacity, your mental wheels start to spin. Some intelligent people feel a compulsion to think. This compulsion may be the biggest passion in their whole lives. This passion is not easily shared. It can make a whole lot of people uneasy when they are with you. This passion can kill most of your chances for friendships, love and sex.Intelligent With None of the AboveOf course, you can be intelligent with none of the above issues. You may be intelligent with regard to a particular thing, like being a really good club DJ, or predicting next year's bond market. After that particular thinking is done, you are quite able to shut it down and go on to big hugs.Love, Lots of Emotions and Passion, for Intellectuals and IntrovertsIt's like being gay. The economics of social life for intellectual introverts are not favourable.In a Quora Answer a few months ago, I did a very rough estimate of how much of a base population is required to support a gay bar in any given, fully industrialized, democratic city. I came up with about 100,000 people for every single gay bar. This takes account of how many people in a given population are likely to be gay and how many are prepared to openly act it out.The economics for intell-introverts (How about “Intellovert” for a new Alt-Right insult word? An Intellovert is not the same as a Libertard.) are worse. “Gay” defines a fairly specific type of physical activity that requires one to seek out other Gays in order to do. Being an introverted, thoughtful, intelligent intellectual is a lot more diffuse.How large a population would it take to support an Intellovert bar, presumably a place with scientific lectures, analytical karaoke fun nights where you compete to sing out various intellectual constructs, nerd girl wet t-shirt contests, bouncers with horn-rimmed glasses, the whole works? If Ottawa had one I'd be down there like a flash. However, if one could conceptualize the details of such an establishment, what population base would you need, maybe 500,000 people per Intellovert bar? It's not a happy equation.Only The Lonely Know the Way I Feel All DayTaking that classic song by the great Roy Orbison a bit further. It takes one intelligent, rather withdrawn, non-emotive person to know how another such person feels. How these sorts of intellectual hookups could be arranged is a challenge. Maybe the social media could help. However, even when you apply your enormous thinking power to the issue, the answer may still be far beyond you.Martin LevineAre you offended when someone says you are privileged because you are white?April 28, 2018Yes. It's an offensive and bigoted thing to say. It's a contention that, because I am a Caucasian, I must be the same as every other Caucasian as every significant way, with the assumption that every last Caucasian is, “privileged”.What Does Privileged Mean?The Merriam-Webster dictionary gives the following definition of privileged, at https://www.merriam-webster.com/.... The definition is their property:1 :having or enjoying one or more privileges: privileged classes2 : not subject to the usual rules or penalties because of some special circumstance; especially : not subject to disclosure in a court of law a privileged communicationand, they define privilege as:: a right or immunity granted as a peculiar benefit, advantage, or favor : prerogative; especially : such a right or immunity attached specifically to a position or an officeSo what, generally is the “privilege” in being just a general Caucasian and who granted it? Who granted the right or immunity?Unless you are living in a country where the laws specifically assign privileges to all Caucasians versus other genetic groups in the population, then one would have to explain, who in power and/or authority granted that special right or immunity?Pre-apartheid South Africa granted rights to Caucasians by law. However, what other examples are there of countries that grant rights or immunities to all Caucasians?I stress, “all”. There are various ways in which people in a given country could be explicitly or implicitly granted certain privileges. In countries with monarchies and aristocracies, members of the royal family and aristocrats have certain rights. In Canada, certain rights are granted with regard to one's official language at birth and to indigenous Canadians in certain identified groups. (I would like to emphasize that receiving those indigenous rights seldom entirely compensate for the other cruelties that were and are inflicted on Canada's aboriginal peoples.)We Are Not Really Talking About “Privileges”, Are We?The use of the term “privilege” is more of an obstacle to thought about discrimination and equality than a help. So, what are we really talking about?-Discrimination-Unequal treatment-Lack of access to opportunities, intentional or not-Being singled out. The assumption because you have an identifiable characteristic you will demonstrate other characteristics, usually negative ones.Stop Calling Me a “Caucasian” Because You are Trying to Erase What Was Done to Me and People Like Meam not a “white”. I am a Jewish-Canadian, aged bisexual from Winnipeg, Manitoba. Calling me just a white attempts to erase some distinctly nasty things that were done to me and mine, right here in Canada:-When I was a kid, Jews weren't allowed to live in certain parts of Winnipeg because of restrictive covenants. We were excluded from the best clubs and golf courses in town. There were beaches where we had been prohibited from going and where we still were not at all welcome. We were routinely insulted and were discriminated against in the professions. The churches were free to call all of us “Christ-killers”. My parents, who were born in 1918, were forced to live with this nonsense much of their adult lives. Now, we face accusations that all Canadian Jews are collectively responsible for decisions made by the current Government of the State of Israel. We get endless threats on the Internet. And, there's that good old, bloated capitalist thing.-Being a bisexual was and still isn't a prescription for social joy. When I was a kid I wasn't quite effeminate but I was distinctly uninterested in boy's stuff, sports, games, competition and aggression. As a result I received continuous bullying, from the sports coach on down. This wasn't any privilege. I still am subjected to numerous micro-agressions when I admit my bisexuality.-Manitoba was the back of the Canadian beyond and to a disheartening extent, is still viewed that way. I experienced the results personally, coming to university in Ontario. The Laurentian Thesis of Canada was everywhere. Manitoba didn't have huge amounts of oil, natural gas and timber under and over the ground, so didn't rate special consideration. What anybody in Manitoba thought about national political anything was considered distinctly insignificant.-Getting old is not a privilege, even if you are white. Frankly there is a lot of bigotry directed at older men of all races, particularly those not visibly under the supervision of a woman. Too often the assumption is that you are an irredeemable patriarch, a social conservative and some one who desperately would like to assault young women (or both young women and young men if you are an old bisexual) and children of all types.The above are my grievances but tell me that you are a privileged white when:-You suffer from a physical or mental disability or an addiction and have to subsist on government disability payments.-You suffered abuse as a child.-Your parents or parent couldn't be bothered to tend you or see that you got an education.Had We Noticed Social Class?I have said the same thing to feminists, usually upper middle class, who talk about all males being privileged. I ask them, have you heard about social class?If you look at the business magazines of Canada, yes, most senior corporate executives are white males. But, how many males, or whites, get to be senior corporate executives? For that matter, how many of those white males are not of British or French origin?Very few whites get to be in the top echelon, decision making elite, of Canadian business or politics. There are many, many whites working in poorly-paid service and industrial jobs with little job security. Basically, they have no say in anything.The reality is that even in western, industrial democracies, a lot more people are the moved or shaken rather than the movers and shakers. Being white does not entitle you to have any social power or personal entitlements at all. It is quite possible to be white and stuck in a low end, no future job, living in a basement apartment in a dingy neighbourhood of Toronto.Don't Import Racial Concepts That Mean Nothing in CanadaThe term “white privilege” seems to have been invented in the USA. For most of the same reasons I give above I don't think it all that much applies there.The USA has a particular racial issue that is a result of slavery and a strong desire to control African-Americans who had been liberated at the end of the Civil War.Particularly in the South, governments and social institutions such as business and churches have been employed as a means to keep Afro-Americans down. When Afro-Americans migrated to cities in other parts of the USA they were seen as a threat there, and police forces and unequal enforcement of laws were used to keep them down.However, what if these types of coercion hadn't existed, would Afro-Americans have risen to the same socio-economic level as the Caucasian population? Or, would you have a Brazilian-type situation, most descendants of black slaves still poor? The misery caused by a prolonged history of slavery doesn't heal itself. It would take huge amounts of social, educational and economic interventions to resolve it.When one attempts to import the concept of white privilege to Canada, what is it supposed to mean? Canada has no history of wide-scale slavery. Until the 1960's the population of Canada mostly consisted of Caucasians and a minority of indigenous Canadians. Canada had been kept mostly Caucasian by an official White Canada policy that somehow never attained the notoriety that the White Australia one did. One could call the White Canada policy a type of white privilege applied to immigration applicants. However that policy ended in the 1960's.Other than Canada's indigenous peoples, most of Canada's non Caucasian populations are a result of that 1960's policy change.What white privilege applies against those populations? There is no legal support for it. Employers are constantly reminded by human rights commissions, advocacy groups and others of what will happen to them if they are detected to be discriminating by race.In Canada white privilege is not the major issue facing non-whites. Immigration laws and regulations have lead to the admission of family class immigrants, some refugees and children of skilled worker and business immigrants, who enter Canada with serious deficiencies in official language knowledge and education. Even Caucasians with those deficiencies have great difficulty in finding employment. Traditional, British and French-based old boys and girls networks are an obstacle for anyone who isn't from those two ethnicities, no matter how white they are.Blame Yourself, Not MeDiscrimination and unfairness certainly exist in Canada. However, and with pain, I have even had to say this about some Jewish people, is it discrimination or is it you? I have been tempted to ask Jewish people who complain a lot, had you not noticed that other Jewish people avoid you like the plague?The more someone objects to being discriminated against by slinging out bigoted labels of their own, the more I suspect they are not realistic about themselves or don't want to be.It is really hard to face your own deficiencies, simple limits on your intelligence and appearance, the limits on your social skills,the limits of your education, the consequences of your occupational choices and self-presentation, etc. However, sometimes, you can't progress unless you accept responsibility for yourself.Go into a multiracial working environment and insist that every last Caucasian there is more privileged than you, and you will get a negative reaction from whites and other non-whites as well.And, the reverse is true. The more someone tells me that they suffer inequality against just exactly whom, and why, and expresses solidarity with other types of people who also suffer it, the more likely I am to think that they have a legitimate point that I ought to listen to. The more they analyze facts and suggest solutions, the more I listen.Martin LevineWhy didn’t Russia reconcile with the US as Germany and Japan have done? Is it because Russians and Americans are inherently incompatible?April 7, 2018I have spent a few months in Russia so I maybe understand their attitude a little bit.The Russians have a set of issues that make it difficult for them to relate to the rest of the world, not just the USA.A Profound Sense of LossThe Russians are sort of like the British. They had an Empire and they lost it. Some parts of the Soviet Union were kept there by force, an internal empire. The Uzbeks, the Ukrainians, the Kazakhs, might have preferred to do their own thing. Then of course there were the “satellite “ countries of Eastern Europe. And, the Russians had outposts in Cuba, Vietnam, Angola and elsewhere.The Empire was the primary source of pride for many Russians. The Soviet Union had a mediocre economy and suppressed a lot of the personal activities that might make an individual proud, so Russia's world stature was it.I think a lot of Russians feel empty. They feel a sense of personal loss. They want someone to blame for what they see as a very bad situation.What If No One Wants to Invade You?Much of what Russians perceive about the world is because the country was invaded by the Tartars, Napoleon and Hitler. Russia's borders are very long and not readily defensible. The Russian focus on being invaded is understandable. They see NATO at the Polish border. But, NATO doesn't want to invade them.This is incomprehensible to Russians. It is almost like telling them that they aren't worth invading. The result for Russians it is an intolerable situation, prospective invaders just sitting there, no build up of forces, no apparent attack plan. It causes individual Russians to feel stressed and bewildered, sort of a continuous, heavy level of anxiety.A Culture With No CultureCommunism meant expelling and killing the Russian elite. Artists and intellectuals were vigorously suppressed. The Communist party tried to substitute a sort of made-up culture, with propaganda songs and films. While Russia's pre-revolutionary culture was decidedly a mixed bag, Russia's cultural roots were cut off.I believe that, in free countries, cultures have a natural progression. At least to some extent this progression represents the right of individuals to make their own choices. That's how cultures stay vital.The Russian elite did bad things but they were the ones with the knowledge and the resources to fund artistry and keep it going. Contemporary Russian culture cannot base itself on that lost heritage. It is not very vital. Russians see K-Pop flourish while their culture is ignored.The Soviet Union was in some senses a set of labour unions, run by corrupt, authoritarian, violent bosses. The Soviet Union took a poverty-ridden peasantry and turned part of it into a poor, urbanized working class, working often in harsh and sometimes dangerous conditions.Russian peasant life was often very difficult, even during Communism. Uncaring nobles and then commissars ruled with a hard, oppressive hand over the peasantry. Often a bottle of vodka and maybe some religion were the only solace.The most prominent ethnic minority within Russia itself were the Jews. Many Russians feared them, both before and during Communism. They were concerned that Jewish businessmen and Jewish intellectuals would produce an aggressive, proficient, big business class that would try to rule the country. Once Communism had eliminated the traditional Russian-origin elite the fear may have been exacerbated.Contemporary Russia has a culture of brutalized, disempowered, fearful people. There is a certain comparison to the supporters of Donald Trump. These are people who don't have a lot of knowledge and little comprehension of nuance. Their national pride is the only road to personal esteem. (This is sometimes referred to as “collective narcissism”.) Even Americans, with their long democratic tradition, find it hard to resist populist, very nationalist, demagogues. How can anyone expect Russians not to?Economic HumiliationRussia should be a very well-off country. It has huge natural resources. They have brilliant scientists and a tradition of disciplined labour. However, they struggle to move up and out of the second world.The Russians pay a heavy price for relying on Vladimir Putin. He presides over a corrupt business oligarchy. This doesn't produce new wealth for most of the population.I don't think Vladimir Putin and his friends want Russians to become middle class. Prosperous, middle class, people lose some of their interest in charismatic leaders. They start to focus on buying stuff and personal self-fulfillment. They become a bourgeoisie.Russians see small countries with limited resources flourish. Japan, Taiwan, Singapore, Belgium, the Netherlands, the Scandinavian countries all have far higher living standards for the general population then Russia.Russia doesn't produce cars for export. It is not a leader in consumer electronics. They don't have a lot of processed agricultural goods to export. To a certain sense they are what Canadians have long feared being, “hewers of wood and drawers of water”.The Russians know that they are not an economic success. It is very hard to face that your national saviour, the man you so much look up to enforce national unity and defeat foreign aggressors, is deliberately impoverishing you.It would be very hard for Russia to reconcile with anybody. There is a great deal of anger and frustration in Russia. There is wounded pride and denial. There is a desire for retribution, not reconciliation. Japan and Germany committed terrible crimes during the Second World War. They should feel grateful for the relatively lenient way they were treated during their occupations. However the Russians were victims, not perpetrators. They were instrumental in defeating the Nazis. They have no reason to fill grateful.America and RussiaAmerica won the Cold War. The Russians lost, badly. This isn't a promising start for reconciliation. The Americans are dealing with a vanquished enemy.America was able to use economic techniques to make numerous countries friendly. The Marshall Plan mattered a lot. The USA permitted Germany and Japan to reindustrialize and rise up to prosperity. America has provided large amounts of investment for other countries. The USA provides a very large market for many other countries. The American entertainment industries are hugely successful world wide.The USA is a member of the Anglosphere. It has natural friends in the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia and New Zealand.The Russians couldn't do any of this. It has been twenty-seven years since the end of Communism but the Russian economy is still weak. Russian entertainment culture is not exportable. There aren't any other Russian-origin countries in the world.When the USA is interacting with Russia and Russians it is interacting with a country and people who are at a severe disadvantage. The Russians only have military threats, Internet warfare and poison attacks overseas as a response. The relationship cannot be a friendly one.Russia Is a Little Like Like Canada, But With Much More BaggageRussia is an old country. It has a long, harsh history. It is not like the USA. Russia is not a country based on a constitution and optimism. It's a country based on ethnicity.I commented in an answer yesterday, Canadian society has to be rather conformist because climatic conditions require the population to support an expensive infrastructure and personal costs in winter are high. You need to work hard to have money for winter clothing, snow blowers, frost-heaved, damaged driveways, frozen pipes, home heating, heavy taxes and winter vacations to keep from going mad. You have to rely on snowplow crews and heating repairmen to survive. Farmers get one crop a year and have to live off of it. There aren't a lot of really warm places where you could manage on your own in a trailer, grow food year round, ride the range and enjoy the sunshine. Much of life in Canada is a collective effort.If you raised the living standard of a Russian city to a prosperous level you wouldn't have Phoenix or Orlando, you'd have Edmonton or Winnipeg. Russian urban life would have the same issues as urban life in Canada.Canada can tolerate multiculturalism. However, in Russia, ethnicity is everything. Ethnicity trumps laws and ideas. There isn't much scope for diversity.The USA can not sell Russia its ideas and lifestyle. Presenting the USA as the exceptional, the house on the hill, doesn't at all impress them, it angers them. Presenting diversity to them is meaningless.Getting Along With RussiaIn Russia I saw many Russians behaving in good, kind, caring ways. They are not bad people.Having been to a lot of countries, I see nationality and personal destiny as a role of the dice. I'm a Canadian Jew. I get to live pretty good with only modest fears.My grandparents were from Russia. Were I living there I'd probably be a miserable as lot of people, on top of being hated by a lot of people and really wanting to emigrate.Were my grandparents in Germany I wouldn't exist.Were I a Jew in Israel I'd spend a lot of time in military service, with a reasonable chance of getting killed in action.Were I a Jew in America I could strive to be Woody Allen.A Russian who was born and brought up somewhere else than Russia, wouldn't be very Russian. If they were born in Toronto they would be a Canadian of Russian origin with some nostalgiaBeing Russian by nationality and residence is a tough dice roll. They have to deal with it their own way. Lecturing them doesn't help.Vladimir Putin himself is a very nationalistic bully with a good propaganda machine. You can't win his friendship. You have to deal with him by force.He won't be there forever. The Russians will have to move on. Whoever comes next may not be so charismatic. He may not be able to convince the Russian public that they have to put up with a stagnant economy and no way to deal with the rest of the world other than raw force and deceit.Outsiders can't change Russia or Russians. There is no point in telling them about how undemocratic they are. In the long term the best way to deal with Russians is to show them that non-angry international relations can lead to prosperity and pride. This is a long term project and reconciliation can only occur very slowly.Martin LevineIs it okay to speak out and criticize the negative ways of other cultures when it does not affect me at all?April 1, 2018Why not? People often speak out and criticize things that do not all effect them.However, are you sure you are not being effected? Judging from the Questions and comments in Quora, people not infrequently feel threatened and provoked by other cultures, even when there is no demonstrable effect by those cultures on their lives.When Does It Go Beyond Speaking Out and Criticism?Some American who participate in Quora visibly believe that Canada doesn't allow free speech, particularly when it comes to different ethnicities and their cultures. This isn't correct. Here is what the Criminal Code of Canada has to say:“Hate Propaganda318 (1) Every one who advocates or promotes genocide is guilty of an indictable offence and liable to imprisonment for a term not exceeding five years.(2) In this section, genocide means any of the following acts committed with intent to destroy in whole or in part any identifiable group, namely,(a) killing members of the group; or(b) deliberately inflicting on the group conditions of life calculated to bring about its physical destruction.(4) In this section, identifiable group means any section of the public distinguished by colour, race, religion, national or ethnic origin, age, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, or mental or physical disability.319 (1) Every one who, by communicating statements in any public place, incites hatred against any identifiable group where such incitement is likely to lead to a breach of the peace is guilty of(a) an indictable offence and is liable to imprisonment for a term not exceeding two years; or(b) an offence punishable on summary conviction.(2) Every one who, by communicating statements, other than in private conversation, wilfully promotes hatred against any identifiable group is guilty of(a) an indictable offence and is liable to imprisonment for a term not exceeding two years; or(b) an offence punishable on summary conviction.(3) No person shall be convicted of an offence under subsection(a) if he establishes that the statements communicated were true;(b) if, in good faith, the person expressed or attempted to establish by an argument an opinion on a religious subject or an opinion based on a belief in a religious text;(c) if the statements were relevant to any subject of public interest, the discussion of which was for the public benefit, and if on reasonable grounds he believed them to be true; or(d) if, in good faith, he intended to point out, for the purpose of removal, matters producing or tending to produce feelings of hatred toward an identifiable group in Canada”The issue is inciting hatred, not speaking out and criticizing.I should mention that Canada only has this one criminal code. Provinces do not have the right to enact criminal legislation.Also, in response to comments I have received from some American Quorans, freedom of speech is very important but so are other freedoms. The freedom from threats, freedom from incitement, freedom from hate, are just as important as freedom of speech.If You Want to Criticize, Know What and Who You are CriticizingIf you really want to be a reasonable, convincing critic, you need to know what it is you are talking about. Common sense can point you in the right direction.I am most familiar with lack of common sense regarding criticisms of Jewish people. However I am sure every culture has a tale to tell. Here are some obvious deficiencies when people criticise Jews.-The Jewish religion must be the same as it purportedly was 2,000 years ago. How could any religion and culture remain unaffected by the passage of two millennia? A cursory Google search would show the searcher that much of the Jewish religion as it now exists came into existence long, long after the Biblical period.-All people in that group agree about everything. Of course not. Every single human being is alone in their own head. There is not yet an equivalent of the Borg. Again, a quick Google search would do the job. Read a couple of Jewish online publications and you would quickly realize that all Jews agree about nothing. (Nor would any group of people.) If you insist that every Jew has a conforming brain link (maybe an in-brain antenna to pick up commands from Jew headquarters) then you really are a racist.-All people who are in a group you are worried about care passionately about that group's affairs. If you look at your own personal life you will quickly comprehend that things are different. Life consists of sleeping, eating, working so you can eat, shopping, cooking, driving, paying taxes, going to the dentist, etc. How much time does anyone have to think about group matters? And what group are they thinking about? Most Israelis might be concerned about the actions of the Government of Israel. However what about some Jew in Winnipeg, Manitoba. What if they are really passionate about the doings of Liberal Party of Canada? What if they are a practising Orthodontist and what really gets their goat is the policies and practises of the Manitoba Dental Association?-Everyone in the group you are worried about has a lot of input into what goes on. What culture is a true democracy? What country is? Every group has its movers and shakers. And then there are what a Canadian writer aptly called, “the moved and the shaken”. That's a lot of people. For critics of what they imagine is Jewish culture, how many Jews have any say in what goes on in the Jewish religion? The decisions are made by a relatively small number of top Rabbis. Unless you are a Jewish religious scholar, why would they listen to you?Read a Few FactsI have seen both far right and far left Questioners in Quora assert that no facts can be relied on because they are controlled by “the media”, the “deep state”, the “corporate elite” or whatever.If you really believe that, isn't it game over? The side you don't like has had an unconditional win, and all hope is gone. You might as well sit there and wait for “the gay agenda”, “world Jewry”, the “Illuminati”, the “corporate oligarchy”, etc., to knock on your door. Or maybe you should make a desperate last run for it.One should always be skeptical about statistics and look for flaws and biases. But some statistics are worth it.Here is a table from Statistics Canada, the Canadian federal statistical agency. These statistics are for something that can readily be counted, the top ten countries of birth for immigrants to Canada.Top 10 countries of birth of recent immigrants, Canada, 2016number%Recent immigrants1212075100Philippines18880515.6India14719012.1China12902010.6Iran420703.5Pakistan414803.4United States330602.7Syria299452.5United Kingdom244452France241552South Korea217101.8Other countries53019543.7Source(s):Statistics Canada, Census of Population, 2016.The statistics are from the article called “Immigration and ethnocultural diversity: Key results from the 2016 Census”.“https://www.statcan.gc.ca/daily-...In Quora and elsewhere we see concerns that people of the Muslim faith are about to take over Canada. If you believe in cultural takeover scenarios then Muslim people have some serious competition. Look at those Filipinos, topping out! And then there's China, right behind.Most Filipinos are Roman Catholics. Should not the takeover conspiracy people worry about a resurgence of Confirmation ceremonies? Surely there is a plot to turn Mandarin into Canada's only official language?Also, look at where Canada's Muslim immigrants are coming from. The top Muslim country for immigration is Iran. Shia Islam predominates there. Pakistan is predominately a Sunni Islam country. Even just a little following of world news will make it evident that these two groups are most unlikely to cooperate.Then, apply the folks are folks test. Immigrants need to eat, not so easy while they are looking for that first Canadian job. They quickly understand that jobs with full pharmaceutical and dental coverage are plumb. Their kids have been put into English or French as a second language training and the provincial curriculum is mandatory. Not much plotting time and scope is left for your average immigrant.As the Criminal Code of Canada states, if you want to express serious concerns about the Filipino way of life that's fine, “if the statements were relevant to any subject of public interest, the discussion of which was for the public benefit, and if on reasonable grounds he believed them to be true;”So, just get your reasonable grounds by Googling “The Philippines”, read up a little bit and go for it. Speak out and criticize the negative ways of Manila!What Are You Worried About?If that different culture does not affect you at all, or course you can criticize, but what are you trying to achieve? Are you trying to convince others that you are right about that other culture and that there is a clear and present danger? If the culture you are criticizing does not exist in your country, what do you believe should be done? Or, are you just describing a situation that is hopeless?Some of the Questions and Comments I see from my fellow Canadians in Quora amount to a “Lament for a Nation”. (This is the title of a famous essay 1965 essay of political philosophy by Canadian philosopher George Grant. The lamentation was for the disappearance of traditional Canadian political culture.) A lamentation can in some cases be appropriate, but is that all you want to do?Are you trying to propose solutions? Had you considered whether the barn doors have been left open and the horses are long gone?Can you identify a particular cultural practise which should not exist? How would you approach this? Should there be a societal conversation with the offending group so that they understand the error of their ways? Alternatively, what about creating a new offence under the Criminal Code of Canada for that nasty, unjustifiable practise? What about taking their children in care? How much taxpayer resources do you want to see spent on prosecutions and what ought the penalty to be?Is your point that, everyone in that offending cultural group is a really bad person? Then what? Do you lock them up for badness?If the nasty cultural practises are happening in another country, should Canada argue for an armed intervention by the United Nations?Where's Your Proof?I have mentioned this in other Answers. What proof have you that the offending culture, or parts of it, are having a bad effect on your country, another country or the world in general?In Canada we use “multiculturalism” to describe a nice, warm, politically correct state of affairs. But, we still have just our two official languages. The Parliamentary system is still the Parliamentary system. Feminism and political correctness are firmly in place. There are no self-governing ethnic enclaves. There are no special exemptions for ethnocultural schools. There are no ethnocultural exemptions from the Criminal Code or much of anything else except for Canada's aboriginal peoples, who certainly got those exemptions the hard way.Prepare To Be ChallengedYou have the right to speak your cultural concerns. What happens if people from the other culture answer back? Do you want a dialogue? Or, should you insist that those people are made up by a troll farm in suburban Moscow?If the bad culture people respond, should you take the principled position that they are just bad people and ought to shut up?So You Can't Speak Out and Criticize?It's very evident from the Criminal Code of Canada that you can. You only get in trouble if you start crying out hatred and threats against people in the other culture.And I'd be the first to admit, there are cultural differences of opinion that are real, whether they effect you or not.An example that is close to me is Orthodox Judaism versus some types of feminism. Orthodox Judaism is gender role specific. Women are meant to be strongly focused on marriage and children. Feminism objects. The feminists have every right to strongly disagree. They aren't doing anything wrong by stating their views.You could be totally unaffected by this cultural clash. However you are still entitled to state your point of view.So, by all means speak out and criticize. If you are mistaken about facts that come from an unbiased source and are easily accessible, you will embarrass yourself. If you can't show that the cultural practices have any significant effect on anything, then your criticisms may be seen as irrelevant. If you can't suggest what could be done you criticisms may still be seen as irrelevant. If someone responds, they may criticize you and your culture. If your real objective is to decry the existence of the people in another culture, you are violating their rights and that's when your troubles will start.Martin LevineWhy aren't there babas and godmen in the Western world while Eastern cultures revere them?March 30, 2018I lived in New Delhi for a couple of years so I kind of get the context of this Question.“Western World” is not an ideal way to talk about this Question. Even within the Christian world there are very different approaches to theology and observance. The so-called Western World includes most Jewish people. The Jewish religion has people who to some extent approximate babas and Godmen. Japan, Taiwan and Singapore are prosperous industrial democracies but their religious traditions are very different.One feature of Indian life that isn't much seen elsewhere is that babas are frequently very poor, often by design. I understand why many Indian people see this as commendable. However, I wonder how much this reflects the reality that India, compared to a lot of other places, is still very, very poor. I suspect that if the Indian economy rose to at least “Second World” status (something like Argentina or Trinidad) that the tradition of extreme poverty would wane.Hinduism Is For IndiaIndia originally wasn't one country but became so. Hinduism had a great deal to do with creating it. It melded together unrelated language groups into one, self-recognizing identity. Hinduism only has relatively small outposts outside of India.When I say the above I am fully aware that India has a large Muslim minority.India and Hinduism are so intertwined that it is quite natural that religious leaders are very highly regarded in Indian society. Those leaders aren't just talking about the theology and interpretation of Hinduism. They are commenting on the meaning of India, how Indians should be, and how India should be run as a country.The only somewhat western example I can think of is Israel. The Jewish religion had a great do with making the country exist. When Rabbis comment, again they are not just talking about Jewish theology, they are talking about what Israel and Israelis ought to do.Very significantly, Hinduism doesn't have a formal religious hierarchy and an infallible central authority. A single religious person cannot readily suppressed from speaking their views. Judaism isn't that much different. There is no central doctrinal authority and no one to force individual Jews to follow an ideological line.From the Roman Empire Straight Into the VaticanChristianity isn't particular to one European nation. The Roman Empire officially adopted it, controlled the religion and compelled it on the peoples of their vast empire. What is now Roman Catholicism adopted the authoritarian Roman structure and the predilection to suppress “heresy” with extreme violence. The Orthodox churches descended from the Byzantine, Eastern Roman Empire, tradition, and weren't much different. When you believe your religion has a supreme, infallible, central authority there is very little room for different opinions.As the various European nations began to form out of the remains of the Roman Empire, they had to address the role of Christianity. These emerging nations had to struggle to coalesce into nationalities. It took a long time for France and Russia to suppress local dukes and boyars and even longer for Italy and Germany.All these new nations were originally authoritarian in nature and all had monarchies. It took a very long time for the “rule of the people” to become a principal idea in European life. Christianity became the ideological backbone of these emerging nationalities. It provided the justification for the “divine right of kings”. Church law was the basis for the civil, criminal and domestic laws of these countries. The upper levels of the clergy lived handsomely with state protection. Any challenge to hierarchically-dictated Christian theology would also be a challenge to the monarch of the country. There was no role for religious dissent or divergent opinions.Religious Rebellion Then More Authoritarian HierarchyEngland rebelled against the Roman Catholic church, which tried to intervene in state affairs and obtain tax revenues. They were successful. However the result was not religious freedom, it was a new Protestant church, Anglicanism. These new church was just as aligned with state power as Roman Catholicism had ever been. There was not going to be any free speech in England about religion.Martin Luther, the first Protestant Reformer, exploited German anger against abusive behaviour by the Papacy and its bureaucracy. However the result was the Lutheran Church, another hierarchy and another fixed theology.The European monarchs responded with extreme violence when wide-scale divergence from official church doctrine happened. Perhaps the single largest example were the suppression of the French Huguenots:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hu...The French monarchy saw to it that the Huguenots, Protestants in an officially Roman Catholic country, were suppressed, tortured and murdered in huge numbers. The Huguenots were a threat to state power.The European states remained on the lookout for religious dissenters who could create Huguenot-type situations.The industrial revolution happened much later and the development of democratic governments in Britain and some parts of Europe not long after. The different churches did not cope at all well with the misery caused to working people by the industrial revolution. Rather the upper church hierarchies to a large extent aligned themselves not just with the monarchs but with the newly emerging industrial elite. The churches lost much of the faith and trust that the average person had had in them. Instead, non-religious ideologies, communism, socialism and social democracy, offered new ideas and new hope to the people.The USA is a Different Christian WorldI offer that late Reverend Billy Graham, Jr., as an example of a very different Christian tradition.https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bi...“As a preacher, he held large indoor and outdoor rallies with sermons broadcast on radio and television, some were still being re-broadcast into the 21st century. In his six decades of television, Graham hosted annual Billy Graham Crusades, which ran from 1947 until his retirement in 2005. He also hosted the radio show Hour of Decision from 1950 to 1954. He repudiated racial segregation. In addition to his religious aims, he helped shape the worldview of a huge number of people who came from different backgrounds, leading them to find a relationship between the Bible and contemporary secular viewpoints. According to his website, Graham preached to live audiences of 210 million people in more than 185 countries and territories through various meetings, including BMS World Mission and Global Mission.Graham was a spiritual adviser to U.S. presidents and provided spiritual counsel for every president from the 33rd, Harry S. Truman, to the 44th, Barack Obama. He was particularly close to Dwight D. Eisenhower, Lyndon B. Johnson (one of Graham's closest friends), and Richard Nixon. He insisted on racial integration for his revivals and crusades, starting in 1953, and invited Martin Luther King Jr. to preach jointly at a revival in New York City in 1957. He was also lifelong friends with another televangelist, the founding pastor of the Crystal Cathedral, Robert Schuller, whom Graham talked into starting his own television ministry.”In his own context Billy Graham could be called a “Godman”. So was the very influential Pastor Robert Schuller. There are other televangelists with very large audiences and considerable influence.Why could the USA be so different?-There is no state church. The American Revolution resolved that question. It also created some freedom of speech, at least for white people. Without a state church there was no state-compelled religious doctrine.-Compared to any given European nation other than Russia, the USA is enormous. The USA has huge rural areas, particularly the South and the Midwest. This was land that was seized from the aboriginal peoples. There was no traditional peasantry on it. Black slaves were forced to do the most grievous work. Outside of the South most farmers held freehold title in their land. As the railway net spread out, agriculture became less about subsistence and more about production for markets. A lot of farmers were not poor. The result, a very large population of still religious, not so badly off, people, far, far away from the industrializing and more secular cities. There was freedom to go and see itinerant preachers and make donations to them. The preachers could say whatever they liked. Now you can watch the preachers on TV and send them donations online.People from South Asia may find some manifestations of this preacher culture garish and materialistic looking. However the USA is generally a prosperous country. Like most things in the USA, religion is marketed. The market is very large and consists to a large extent of reasonably well-off people. It is not hard for a successful preacher to make a lot of money and live well. Some of them are still sincere.Jewish GodmenHere's a Jewish Godman. Rabbi Menachem Mendel Schneerson:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Me...“As leader of the Chabad-Lubavitch movement, he took an insular Hasidic group that almost came to an end with the Holocaust and transformed it into one of the most influential movements in religious world Jewry, with an international network of over 3,000 educational and social centers. The institutions he established include kindergartens, schools, drug-rehabilitation centers, care-homes for the disabled and synagogues.Schneerson's published teachings fill more than 300 volumes, and he is noted for his contributions to Jewish continuity and religious thought, as well as his wide-ranging contributions to traditional Torah scholarship. He is recognized as the pioneer of Jewish outreach. Many of his adherents refused to believe that he died on June 12, 1994, believing instead that he did not really die but will reveal himself to be the messiah.”Is Rabbi Schneerson that different from Godmen or Gurus in India.?Here is one difference. Judaism requires a lot of books. Not all are online by any means. Basically you need a library. This means you can't be too itinerant. Also, as you can see from Rabbi Schneerson, Jewish people like to see concrete results in the form of kindergartens, schools, etc. Except in Israel, the society around us does not provide them. Even there we still have to provide our own synagogues, rabbinical schools and religious old folks homes. We have to do it ourselves.Not all Jews are totally western though. Consider this:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ba...“Rabbi Israel Abuhatzeira (Hebrew:ישראל אבוחצירא‬), known as the Baba Sali (Arabic:بابا صلى‎, Hebrew:באבא סאלי‬, lit. ""Praying Father"") (1889–1984) was a leading Moroccan Sephardic rabbi and kabbalist who was renowned for his ability to work miracles through his prayers. His burial place in Netivot, Israel has become a shrine for prayers and petitioners.He died in 1984 (4 Shevat 5744). His funeral was attended by an estimated 100,000 people. His gravesite in Netivot has become a popular pilgrimage site in Israel. On the anniversary of his death, thousands come to visit his tomb and pray.”Sounds familiar, doesn't it? We call this great man “Baba”.How Long Will Babas and Godmen Survive in India?What if the Indian economy continues to expand and India finally reaches the level of Argentina? I think India would see a transmutation of the Baba-Godman tradition.A commitment to the saintliness of extreme poverty does not last in a prosperous country. If virtually every home in India had a TV set and cable, or even a computer, how long would itinerant, extremely poor Babas survive? They would start to look for TV studios to work from, and IT people who can give them a good website.This is a mental experiment with no sure conclusion, but in an educated, urbanizing India, how long will extreme devotion thrive? Can the rural hinterlands of India ever be the equivalent of the American South and Midwest?In a society with money, people expect religion to generate physical structures, such as this:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ca...“The Cathedral of Tomorrow was built in 1958 as home to Rex Humbard's ministry. The Cathedral, a round building with the sanctuary in the middle and classrooms and offices around the edges, located in Cuyahoga Falls, Ohio, seats 5,400. It has a domed roof with a large illuminated cross that hangs from the ceiling. The cross weighs 32 tons (to give the domed roof greater architectural strength during wind storms) and is illuminated with 4,700 lights which can change colors. It is one of the largest interior crosses in the world. When the cathedral was built it was the largest permanently domed building in the world without interior pillar support. This gives the audience greater visibility toward the stage.Under Humbard's ministry, Cathedral services were broadcast on 600 television stations in the United States and Canada, as well as on stations in many other countries.”Would a more developed India have one or more Hindu versions of these? Would the Babas and Godmen of India come to resemble Billy Graham, Robert Schuller and Rex Humbard?Martin LevineWhat are the advantages and disadvantages of immigration?February 21, 2018This question could be taken as “what are the advantages and disadvantages for the immigrant” or “what are the advantages or disadvantages for the receiving country”? I will talk about the receiving country.Those who have seen my Answers know that I am strongly in favour of immigration to Canada. However I would not attempt to apply the Canadian example to more than a few other countries. Why could Canada handle it?-Canada is a geographically huge country with a sparse population. There's still room.-At least in the case of English-speaking Canada, whatever national identity there is isn't as racially-based as it used to be.-Canada is geographically isolated. We can control illegal immigration. Most illegal immigrants to the United States want to stay there. Otherwise Canada is very far from other places except Greenland and St. Pierre and Miquelon. By contrast Australia is only a couple of hundred of kilometres of warm water from a very heavily-populated part of the developing world.-Partly because Canada is so geographically isolated, we've been able to focus on selected, legal, permanent immigration. We are able to limit the entry of poorly-educated family members and low-skilled workers.-Partly because the immigration is so much more tightly controlled than many other nations, Canada has been able to focus on keeping the “ethnics” under control. Canada has compact, confident elites that do not dispute each other very much. They are able to formulate and implement what they want to do about immigrants.How many other countries are in this type of situation?If You Can't Control Your Employers Then Don't IndulgeThe European Union and the United States are examples, stop your employers from hiring illegal immigrants or you will have very bad problems.For years, both countries tolerated their employers using illegal immigrant as a cheap, docile source of labour. The results have been calamitous. Very large populations of alienated, embittered migrants have been created, restricted to a social netherworld. Since these migrants don't officially exist as immigrants, they don't have any clear pathway to integration and positive involvement in their new country. These populations are vulnerable to human traffickers, petty criminals and extremists.In my opinion it would have been better if the the European Union and the United States had never accepted these immigrants. It's nothing against them as people. It's the way they got there and the refusal of the recipient countries to deal realistically with the situation. The DACA situation in the USA is a sad result.What would have happened if the United States Border Patrol and the US inland authorities had been allowed to focus their resources on inspecting work sites and prosecuting employers of illegal immigrants? Maybe the USA could have had a rational immigration policy.When Country Equals Ethnicity, There Isn't Much Space for ImmigrantsSome countries base their core identity on ethnicity and race. If protecting that identity is paramount, that country should probably do without immigrants. There is not much possibility of that country ever making peace with immigration.If there is some perceived strong need in that country for immigration, then there needs to be a national debate first, before that immigration happens. Is there something that immigrants could do so as not to disrupt that country's identity? For example, if that country lowered the racial appearance bar somewhat, but demanded near total assimilation from immigrants, would that work?That debate can't just include the elites. Canada can get away with elite control of immigration policy because of its huge size, its emptiness and its isolation from countries that produce illegal immigration. Immigrants don't easily get in the average person's space. But, what about a country that have limited land and limited resources? The elite can isolate themselves from the negative effects of immigration. However the potential for negative impact on the average citizen can be very big.I don't think there is any scope in these sorts of countries for any meaningful multiculturalism. If that country is not prepared to state that it will not tolerate multiculturalism, and make it clear to immigrants that this is what they are coming to, then immigration is a bad idea.Immigration Might Have Been Good Before But It's Not NowThe United Kingdom has a population density of over 260 persons per square kilometre. This small country has a population of about 66,000,000 people. At the start of the 1960's the United Kingdom had a population of less than 53,000,000 people. This can't go on. Lack of population control is one of the major reasons for Brexit.Canada has a population density of less than four persons per square kilometre. The population density of the United States is somewhat more than 35 people per square kilometre, less than 14% that of the United Kingdom. Germany is almost as densely populated as the United Kingdom.As a personal view, some of the most populous countries might do well with a gradual population reduction. Would a United Kingdom with perhaps only a stable population of about 50,000,000 be a less stressed, less anger-ridden place?Germany did a great humanitarian act by accepting something in the order of 1,000,000 refugees from the Middle East. However, aside from any cultural issues, population densities set an upper limit on much more humanitarian action. At a certain level, population density passes a certain threshold and then it will rapidly escalate into a major social issue. In that type of situation, all but the most limited, selected immigration will have to go by the board.Some Countries Could Benefit from More ImmigrationThere are a few countries that might actually benefit from an enthusiastic, selected immigration program.RussiaRussia has a population in decline. The country is very spacious, with enormous resources. Some skilled and entrepreneurial immigration would probably help without crowding the existing population very much.More importantly though, well-selected immigration might help Russians overcome some of their anger and fear against foreigners. Many Russian environments are uni-ethnic. There is no opportunity to encounter non-Russians, except migrants from the former Soviet republics. Some person to person contact would help.ArgentinaWikipedia has an informative immigration article about Argentina:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Im...“According to official data, between 1992 and 2003 an average 13,187 people per year immigrated legally in Argentina. The government calculates that 504,000 people entered the country during the same period, giving about 345,000 undocumented immigrants. The same source gives a plausible total figure of 750,000 undocumented immigrants currently residing in Argentina.”Other data shows that Argentina's net migration rate is still low.By contrast, Canada, with a somewhat smaller population, has been receiving about 250,000 to 300,000 immigrants per year, for many years.Argentina has resources in a spacious country. Its fertility rate is declining. The country has a history of economic protectionism.Immigrants could find business and investment opportunities there, without provoking the fear of foreign control.Immigration Will Only Work Well For a Few CountriesImmigration has done a lot of good for Canada and as I understand it for Australia. However these are rare types of countries in the world.Immigration could have worked better for some countries, but it wasn't allowed to.I would like to apply the Canadian immigration attitude to the rest of the world but I can't. Even within the developed word we see countries more troubled with immigration than benefiting from it. Above all there is that population density limit. Immigration is not a good means for more fortunate countries to help the people of less-fortunate ones.Martin LevineAs USA is a democracy and it's leaders are elected by ordinary American citizens, should they be held accountable for all the horrible things that their government has done to people of other countries?February 6, 2018No, of course not, and I say that as a supposedly lefty-lib, supercilious Canadian.The USA is Big Because It's BigThe USA is a geographically very large country with a very big population, a big economy and a big military. However, this doesn't mean that an individual American is “bigger” than anybody else in a small country. They are just people as average as anyone else, living in a country whether things are run in a certain way, often by a small elite of other people.Be Realistic About Mass DemocraciesAn individual citizen in any democratic country has very limited influence on decisions made by their national government. The average American does not influence foreign policy and military decisions.In fact, the USA has always had a strong isolationist movement. Many Americans don't want foreign involvements at all, good or bad. Their focus is exclusively on the USA. They want to influence national, state and local affairs, things that matter to their everyday lives.Educational levels in the USA are not universally high. Teaching about foreign countries is not necessarily a priority, even in better schools. A sizable part of the American population would lack not only the motivation, but the knowledge to favour or not favour certain foreign policies. Nor do they necessarily have the resources or the time to educate themselves. Consider as well that, in the USA and other countries, social media or even mainstream media put out a great deal of “information”that is of dubious factuality, with many contradictory facts being put out, and a decent share of outright lies.It takes a very high level of motivation for a significant number of Americans to organize on foreign affairs issues and challenge their own elites. In a limited information and limited knowledge environment that motivation is hard to get.Take it farther, how many Members of Congress or Senators have much influence on the international behaviour of the USA? A very large part of all such decision-making power is vested in the President and a few advisors, a few senior Senators who have foreign affairs input, senior officials in a few agencies such as the CIA and the NSA and some top military officers. (The military elite seems currently to be the primary advocates of caution and restraint in foreign interventions!)Then of course there are big business interests that historically have had a lot of power over American foreign affairs, such as the oil companies, and the lobbyists who represent them. It used to be the banana plantation companies.Secret, Secret, Secret, Not for the Likes of You!The USA has a rather strong tradition of keeping information that guides foreign affairs decisions, particularly foreign military affairs, very secret. The average American certainly does not get to review that information and provide input. Sometimes even an American who cares about foreign affairs hasn't the least clue why a decision has been made. Whatever explanation they get from their authorities may have a tenuous relationship to reality.I should stress, this is not a characteristic of the USA only. However the USA has huge military and economic resources to apply against foreign matters. Canadians don't get the secret stuff either but Canada is not a significant international power. The lack of knowledge of the average Canadian makes virtually no difference to the world.Lie, Lie and Lie Real GoodOne should remember the US military forgetting to tell the average American that is was bombing Cambodia. Then there was Iran Contra. Then there was Saddam Hussein's weapons of mass destruction.Farther back, the CIA decided that a democratically elected Prime Minister of Iran had to go. It did not first hold public hearings in town halls and meet with break-out groups.https://www.theguardian.com/worl...Mohammad Mosaddeq wasn't a communist. The British Government participated in the lie. Nobody told Americans that he was deposed because the oil companies wanted him gone.What can any citizen of any country do when their own government's foreign policy establishment lies without compunction, and you have no way to know the truth? What do you expect from Americans?“All the Horrible Things”, Really?Was the American intervention against German and Japanese horrible? Was the Marshall Plan horrible? is American foreign aid horrible? Is the Public Broadcasting System doing documentaries about the countries of the developing world horrible? Was the persistent condemnation by so many Americans of Apartheid horrible? Was the US intervention when Saddam Hussein conducted an unprovoked aggression against his Arab neighbours horrible?Let's develop an index of international horribleness, country by country, and put the USA somewhere on the list. How would the USA stack up against Germany, Japan, the Soviet Union, Pakistan, Iran, Cuba (pointlessly exporting futile and murderous revolutions), Iraq and a fair number of others.If you put these different countries on a scale and balanced each one, with its well-intentioned foreign actions versus its horrible actions, the USA doesn't necessarily have such a high, net negative score. Even without a lot of general public input into foreign affairs matters, the USA has done some massively good international things.How many citizens of the East Asian and European countries would have preferred a USA that was totally isolationist and never intervened regarding anything, like World War II?If You Don't Like What the USA Is Doing, Learn Who's in Charge and Who Isn'tThe USA is not a homogeneous monolith. It consists of a very large, very diverse population. This “America” doesn't decide what the USA does overseas. Those who think the USA does horrible things need to identify the small number of American individuals who have real foreign policy input and then, if they want, “out” them and berate them.A citizen of another country who wants to influence average Americans needs to understand how diverse Americans are. They need to accept that non-elite Americans have to struggle to find accurate information about overseas matters. If that foreign citizen won't do that, then they can't do public diplomacy or make a case. They can't motivate Americans to question their own elites.Taking an accusatory or imbalanced stance, or a simplistic stance on how American foreign policy decisions are made, is a sure way to assure you won't be heard and that the actions you consider “horrible”, will not be known to the American public. To the extent that the American public has any influence on the country's foreign policies you have lost your chance.Martin LevineHow did the mirror universe Terrans on Star Trek stay so racist and yet so diverse as humans?January 23, 2018I commented about this a few days ago but this topic is Uchronia-heaven.What Does Star Trek Mean By “Fascism”?They used the word.Fascism doesn't have to mean National Socialism. You can just have a not-particularly racist, fascist regime. Fascism didn't even rule out some free enterprise. Business corporations can still exist and hire on the basis of evil merit.Star Trek's Terran Empire is meant to be seriously evil but it isn't very hard for people to be vicious anyhow. Some would argue that this is the natural state of mankind.So, we don't know exactly what kind of fascist state Star Trek's writers are talking about. It would be kind of a distraction from the story line to say that, in the Bad Universe, various business corporations that exist in our universe, exist there too. For example, if the story line depicts an evil Microsoft, an evil Paramount Pictures, an evil Toyota, an evil Starbucks, etc., it would makes things rather complex, plus invite lawsuits, particularly if the same senior executive staff exists, just really evil, or at least even more evil than in our nice universe.What Does Star Trek Mean by Racist?I think maybe they wanted to say species-ist, but didn't want to sound like a politically correct lecture on social evils. The term racist is very well known, and evokes Nazism, so as to scare the hell out of everybody.In one earlier Star Trek series episode, all sentient life in the galaxy is the result of the very first warp-capable species throwing their DNA all over the place. Maybe the humans, the Klingons, the Romulans, the Cardassians, etc., are now just seen as races sprung off that bipedal, four-limbed, communicate with sound waves, core.Something that has been bothering me is, where the hell are the evil universe Borg and Q's? You would think at some point they would have clipped the Terran Empire's wings.Nasty, Anglo GalaxyIn my last Answer on this topic, like other Answerers, I suggested the point of departure into the Bad Universe might have been no decline and fall of the Roman Empire, which was more culture than race-oriented. The Romans conquer the world and then segue into a Mussoliniesque, galaxy-oppressing nightmare.However the Terran Starship folks and the Empress seem to be speaking English, not Italian. Nobody is whipping out their universal translators to communicate. So, what have we got, the United Kingdom and/or the USA having going horribly wrong?The English language as we know it didn't start to solidify into Germanic-Romance hybrid Middle English until a couple of centuries after the Norman conquest. This limits the dates for our point of departure a little bit. Some possible British-origin nasties:Mean, Mean Henry VIIIThe Alternative Henry VIII is even nastier than he really was. The Court of Star Chamber triumphs. Away we go, mean England, than mean everywhere.George III Behaves BadlyHe wasn't the most mentally stable monarch Britain ever had. In the Bad Universe he freaks out after a few American victories in the early part of the Revolutionary War, conspires with the most evil members of the aristocracy and the pre-Dickensian business class, suppresses the American Revolution with some Hitleresque tactics and keeps on rolling.The Victorian United Kingdom Goes the TubeSay, around 1890, the British upper class and the then fully-Dickensian British business elite decide they don't want to hear about anything Karl Marx might have said. Also, they don't want any competition from the Germans or the French. Combined with sympathetic senior officers in the British military they stage a coup. They take Germany down first and then the French after. The nice things the Labour Party and the Liberals did in our universe don't happen. Horrible Britannia rules the world and decides to rule the galaxy too.Big Brother Wins the WorldGeorge Orwell gave us a thoroughly evilized United Kingdom. However, take it a little further. Big Brother gets himself a nuclear arsenal and some forlorn Oceanian rocketeer hits the wrong button and takes out Eurasia and Eastasia all together. Poor Big Brother no longer has his eternal enemies. This English-speaking scourge of everywhere needs some new faces to boot stomp or else the justification for maintaining his monstrous world regime is a little shaky.It's hard enough to compel all the newly-conquered unEnglish oppressees to speak English, even at the pain of death. Consequently Newspeak has to go.Since Big Brother couldn't care less about how many people get killed in his scientific experiments, he gets his warp drive pretty quickly. He holds off the masses with some good, old-fashioned anti-semitic paranoia and worries about the new conquerees getting restless. Soon enough he has his warp drive and then we are off to jackboot the Klingons, Vulcans, et all.Granted the nice British Empire was somewhat racist but they banned slavery early on and admitted that some Arabs and South Asians are great fun to be with. You can see the progression.But They Speak American EnglishSome American linguists assert that American English is what British English used to sound like.In any case, wag the dog. A world dictator isn't interested in maintaining national identities. The bad universe non-USA has more English speakers than the evil non-United Kingdom. Linguistic assimilation takes its course.Gold old Star Trek has given us a plot concept that never can die. How can we run out of ways to imagine human beings being evil!Martin LevineWhy doesn't communism work?January 17, 2018People could argue forever what “Communism” ought to be, but I will use the real life example, a highly-authoritarian nation state that enforces state ownership of most of the economy, justifying the system because it will create social equality and ever person's real needs will be met. So, we are talking about the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China before it became rather capitalist, in particular. There are only a few, rather forlorn survivors left, particularly North Korea and Cuba.People Are Just PeopleIt is sometimes said that we die alone, but we live alone too. Every human being can only know what's in their own head. We try to meld with others but you can never know for sure what even your parent or spouse is thinking.Nations and cultures can fling all sorts of socialized arguments against you. (I include religion and various political systems, not just Communism.) However, what matters to any human being is their own mind and body and its needs and desires. By comparison, most of the rest of reality is background noise.Yes there are people who are ready to die for their country and their principles in wars. But this isn't daily life. Your stomach, your genitals, your desire for comfort, your pride, they rule.Some People Will Always Game the System, No Matter WhatCommunists proposed the “new socialist man”, liberated from self-orientation and greed by a socially just system. This was naive. The Marxists of the 1800's had limited knowledge of the human brain. Their explanation of human behaviour was entirely psychologistic. It wasn't true. It isn't possible to motivate everybody and make them altruistic. Personality disorders, neuroticism and psychopathic behaviour happen anyhow.If you see yourself as an altruistic, pro-social person, you will see lots of others who won't be and won't or can't change, even at the threat of death. They will lie, steal, rejoice in criminality and will never, never, do an honest days work. Everyone else sees their altruism being treated with contempt. Not infrequently some of the worst people are in authority and steal big. This will always happen in a political and economic system with no accountability and no transparency. Cynicism takes over.Social Class Isn't Everything in Human LifeCommunism insisted on a one dimensional model for how people defined themselves and each others, social class. That isn't life. People identify with people who look like them and speak the same language, social class or not. They hate people who are different from them, the same social class or not. People don't at all necessarily behave on the basis of their “class interests”. You may still love your family even if some of them are richer than you.It's About the Merchandise, and the Indexed PensionCommunists didn't comprehend the economically positive role of retailers and wholesalers. Their vision was goods being rationed out by government stores and services being provided by bureaucrats.Not all retailers and wholesalers add value to the society but many do. They do a remarkably good job at identifying people's priorities for wants and needs, far better than a privileged government bureaucracy can. Even advertising has its place.In the 1800's the Communists didn't understand that regulatory exercises could curtail some of the worst aspects of the capitalist system. There weren't any social welfare states at the time. Karl Marx and Friederich Engels had no way to envision social democracies, justifying free enterprise with remedial social programming.Once these states evolved the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China had no response other than lies. They tried to convince the peoples of the developing world that social democracy could never happen for them but had no convincing argument why. When they bribed national leaders in the developing world into supporting them, it didn't help the mass of the population much at all. There were a few large-scale infrastructural projects, some second hand military equipment and local elites using “socialism” as an excuse for oligopolies and kleptocracy.Pay Your Elites or They Won't Do AnythingA supposedly egalitarian society still needs elites who are motivated enough to do things. Not everyone can be a cosmonaut, design MIG jet fighters, build a nuclear bomb, play brilliant chess or validate your excessive cultural pride by being a ballerina. These talented people have to be allowed to rise to a real top, where they are motivated by high pay or perks. Otherwise, why should they make the effort? Aside from your party bureaucrats and patriotic military heroes, these people have to be part of a privileged class. So much for egalitarian.The Cultural Nationalism Wolf in a Communist Sheep's ClothingThe Soviet Union never stopped being Russia. The People's Republic of China never stopped being China.These were two peoples who had an enormous pride in their culture, to the point of collective narcissism. These were also two peoples who had historically been humiliated. Both approached the rest of the world with a huge chip on their shoulder.Soviet and Chinese internationalism meant cultural imperialism. They devalued other people's cultures to feel better about their own. This type of behaviour makes you hated. You lose your chance to convince anybody else that they really ought to be Communist. When I was living in Vienna I met people who had escaped the then Czechoslovakia during the Soviet era. They had been forced to learn Russian in school and were very proud of not remembering a word of it.The Individualistic, Alpha, Angry, Aggressive Male Promotes Communism for Everybody Else But ThemThink about Lenin, Stalin, Mao Tse Tung, Fidel Castro, Nikita Khrushchev, Nicolae Ceaușescu, Władysław Gomułka, Erich Honecker and Kim Jong-un.These are all guys, totally self-confident, totally controlling, aggressive, and mostly living very well. The Communist regimes relied on them. They were what Communism meant. These men believed the end justifies the means. My ego is what matters, if a lot of people die, well, so what?Communism in practice was almost the reverse of what it preached. It was about the enormous egos of powerful men. It was about privileged elites. It was about cultural aggression. It was an unsupported idea about why people do what they do. It ignored the requirements for high economic production. It was about bad decisions made by angry people. By the end of the communist era it was mostly about the threat of a nuclear bomb on top of a missile. (And still is in the case of Mr. Kim.)Pride runs out. People want to eat well, acquire things and sleep with the most attractive other people. Present day Russia and China have remnant political elites that don't believe in Communism any more. Two sad, poor countries are what is left of the real thing.Martin LevineDo you agree that American democracy doesn't work in the Middle East?January 14, 2018Basically yes, but this answer needs to be qualified.There Isn't One Middle EastThe term “Middle East” is not an ideal one for describing that part of the world that extends from the coast of Morocco to the border between Iran and Pakistan or maybe the border between Pakistan and India. The best that could be said is that the great majority of people in the region more or less observe Sunni and Shia Islam. This doesn't mean complete cultural unity. Iranians mostly speak Farsi, not Arabic, and Persia is culturally very old, with that culture originating far before Islam.Within the region there are a number of different countries, each with their own governmental system, or, in a few cases, internal war. If you wanted to democratize those countries which weren't even attempting democracy, one size would not fit all.Can You Transfer American Democracy Anywhere?I don't think you can take the current American democratic system and transfer it anywhere. Very justifiably, American democracy has been codified in a way that corresponds to American history and geographic circumstances. This democracy is a “package”, with some features that are shared with the British Commonwealth of Nations. Some features are unique to the USA. Some particular features:-The Common Law and its precedents-A loyal opposition-Freehold land title-Habeus Corpus-Innocent Until Proven Guilty-An adversarial legal system-Very different standards between criminal and civil proof-A federal system where subfederal units have their own sphere of authority and sovereignty-Representation by population is not supreme. The Senate is the upper chamber.-Elected bureaucrats, e.g, sheriffs and judges-Law making by plebiscite, e.g., Propositions-No established religion and the primacy of secularism in public life-A separation between the Executive, the legislature and the judiciary, with checks and balances-A provision for recall of unpopular officials-Freedom of speech checked only by libel and slander laws-The right to bear armsLook at the RealitiesIn some Middle Eastern countries the population is quite poor. Even where countries have substantial oil resources, much of the revenue is monopolized by uncaring, morally repugnant elites.Your religion may be all that gets you through life, a very hard life, every day.In some cases international boundaries were imposed on the region by European colonizers. The people were not consulted on what nation state they would like to live in. They may feel that they have been jammed into a country against their will, alongside other ethnicities they don't want to be with.Political systems were not infrequently imposed by the colonial powers. There was no opportunity for the mass of the population to develop some type of democracy that might suit their own culture. Even after decolonization, neo-colonialism and the Cold War concept of developing countries as pawns on a chess board, took hold.Economic freedom may not be seen very well, when it means that developed countries, with vastly superior capital and technology, can take economic control.How Do You Get From Here to There?In order to make some Middle East countries democratic, there would have to be some transition plan, over a multiyear period. It isn't possible to invade and occupy a particular, offending country, and make them practise Jeffersonian democracy the next day. That plan would have to answer some questions about governance that might lead to a non-American type of democracy:-How do you buy the elites off? Some elites will be needed to run the country, senior bureaucrats, technicians, military officers, police chiefs, senior regulators, etc. If they don't get something out of the transition they will attempt sabotage. You need a plan where elites can operate and prosper, within a democratic structure.-How do you sanitize your elites and your bureaucracy? You will need to impose police colleges, military training schools, training for bureaucrats, professional degree standards enforced by state-endorsed professional licencing authorities, and anti-harassment and workplace anti-discrimination laws. You will need trained stock market regulators. You will have to find funding for this apparatus.-Does that country need a federal system? Federalism can deal with the issues of a large geography and local ethnicities. However again, in order to create a federation, you have to manage the elites. The national elites may have to give some to the local ones.-Do you have to concede a state religion? Without some recognition of the majority religion much of your population will find the transition to democracy unbearable. With skill you can balance the existence of a state religion with constitutional guarantees of religious minority rights.-Should representation by population reign supreme? It doesn't in the USA. Even the electoral college is an American peculiarity. The United States Senate is not representation by population. How can you explain to the citizens of a new democracy that this is democratic?-Some democracies insist on the supremacy of Parliament. The executive is a subset of parliamentary functions. (The Prime Minister is an elected member of the legislature and maintains that position with the consent of his party.) Even in the USA some will argue that the Supreme Court should not overrule the legislature. Parliamentary supremacy may be easier for the citizens of a new democracy to deal with. From their point of view, a non-elected Supreme Leader has simply been substituted by an elected one.-In countries where hateful, discriminatory speech has been the order of the day, some freedom of speech may have to be limited, so as to stop chaos. A new democracy may not be able to operate when different groups are allowed to spew out hate at each other.-Electing local officials in a country with no democratic tradition may mean local demagogues, sort of the old Hollywood image of southern sheriffs, on steroids. You may need for those officials to be selected by a strong national or provincial authority.-You may have to check economic freedom. Local business elites will have to be reigned in. If foreign investment means that your economy will come under foreign control, the new democracy may require tight restrictions.-There may need to be painful decisions about borders. What happens when an unhappy ethnic group has been forced into the wrong country? Some serious federalism might help. However you may have to ask national majorities to let those minorities go.How Do You Give Advice?Regrettably and maybe unfairly, the USA is unpopular in much of the developing world, not just the Middle East. If you can somehow get to a situation where you could talk with both undemocratic national regimes and the mass of their populations about transitioning to democracy, you should not say, “American democracy”.It would almost certainly be better to give democratic guidance from a panel of different democracies, not only the USA. This will give something of a smorgasbord of solutions to what a new democracy should look like. This creates choices and some self-empowerment for the nations concerned. They can get advice from smaller democracies, that have no self-serving interests in the region.Martin LevineWhy does Trump use words like ""sh**hole country”, and what does this mean?January 13, 2018Donald Trump is an old property developer. He's a man of a previous generation. They knew nothing about political correctness. Vulgarisms were their way of communicating.I'm not excusing this, but, in my downmarket, historic, Winnipeg there were some other common zingers that one didn't hesitate to use, except in “polite company”. I am not recounting these for prurient grounds. This is how guys talked, including property development guys:“Couldn't find his ass with both hands.”“Wouldn't know his ass from a hole in the ground.”“As dumb as they come”.and so on and so forth.I come from a modest background. That's how a lot of modest background people communicated.One should remember that political correctness is a relatively new concept. It wasn't around when Donald Trump was a young man. A lot of successful men from that generation had insulated themselves from anything like political correctness, by the time it came around. They didn't learn the concept and can't understand.Vulgarisms As a Release Under Developing World StressI was a foreign service officer and, we used that word, I admit it. There was a tendency, at times, to lose your optimistic attitude and say to yourself and selected others, “What am I doing in the f—cken sh**thole?”Of course in the diplomatic world we knew when not to use that word. We would use diplomatic words like “developing”, “challenged, “making good progress”.But you were living your daily life in that country. The things you saw every day were a horror. At that point your compassion and humanitarian skills were sorely tested. You had to push back the “sh**hole word pretty hard.I almost wonder whether Donald Trump got drunk with some members of his own diplomatic core.Donald Trump's Freedom of SpeechAmerica is a country where so many people insist on absolute freedom of speech. It's a constitutional right. It doesn't matter whether others find what you are saying humiliating and threatening. So, why should Donald Trump restrain himself? There may be an assumption that the President ought to limit their speech, but an assumption is all it is.Does Donald Trump Really Identify With His Base?We don't know how hypocritical Donald Trump is. For all we knows he actually identifies with his “base”. He is not a member of any of America's traditional elites.Since Donald Trump's meeting, where he allegedly used the “sh**thole” word, wasn't recorded, Donald Trump has plausible deniability. Given the bipartisanism of the reports it's likely he did use the word. However, if any of his base cares, they can simply dismiss the reports as yet more lies.But, if they do believe he said “shithole”, would his base care? Donald Trump promoted himself to his base by promising there would be no more political correctness. How many of Donald Trump's poor, working class and rural supporters have the means to travel to Haiti or Africa? Not just the right-wing media, but mainstream or, to the extent it exists in the USA, left of centre media, report an endless stream of dismal stories from Haiti and Africa. The image is so often that of hopeless places beyond redemption. Racism is almost certainly a factor, but what have progressive Americans done to disabuse the rest of America about this image? To his base, Donald Trump looks like a strait-shooter who tells it like it is. Donald Trump may see himself that way and think he is helping people.America Needs a Decent Immigration DebateI have commented on this in previous Answers. The USA has not secured its southern border so the discussion of immigration is locked on the issue of illegal migration. This doesn't leave much scope for a discussion of effective selection policies.Canada is purportedly a more “left wing” country than the USA, but is not all that generous in admitting immigrants from the developing world. There are annual quotas on Family Class and Refugee immigration. The core of the system is skilled worker and business immigration, selected according to a point score on a grid. The immigrants who get selected from the Developing World tend to be highly educated, highly-skilled, and highly proficient in English and/or French.I would not really want to revive the term “limousine liberal” but the reality it describes exists in the USA, and in Canada.If you are affluent and secure you don't necessarily understand that it is the working class and the poor of your own country who will suffer by far the most from an inadequate immigration policy. Poorer Americans are the most likely to suffer from the competition of lower-skilled migrants. I reject totally Donald's Trump's assertion that all Mexican migrants to the USA are rapacious criminals. However, the southern border of the USA is porous. Drug dealers and human smugglers do come in. If you live in a gated community, well-clear of the border, you may not need to worry. It's the poorer neighbourhoods where illegal migrants reside, most of them just seeking work, but some members of this unregulated flow will be criminals.It is absolutely counterproductive to accuse Donald Trump's base of being racists, with no knowledge and no compassion. A lot of these people voted for Donald Trump because they are angry and scared. They know they are the ones who are getting impacted. If no one else can offer them plausible solutions, then the “sh**thole” word will ring in their ears.Is a Career Politician a Socially Valuable Hypocrite?My comment refers to Canada too.A career politician voluntarily deprives them self of their freedom of speech. Obviously this is a good way to get votes, offend no one and be sparing about telling too much truth. I contend however, that career politicians have a special skill set that countries need, even if a politician is entirely self-interested. Speaking frankly and obscenely is not one of the necessary skills. Accepting obscene insults as a valid mode of communicating in the political world will lead to bad results:-As I said in a recent answer, a career politician know how to suffer whoever they think are fools. Lashing out at idiots, or countries you think are useless, may be your instinct. You may really want to curse them all, but they will lash back. This wastes your political time and frustrates any agenda you really have.-Elites sometime get catered to by politicians for a good reason. Populists may dislike it but any country relies on elites in order to function. It takes expertise to draft laws, do analyses, regulate your country's economy, etc. You need academics, you need scientists, you need infrastructural planners. Catering with vulgar language to the fears poor people have may get you votes for a while, but you can't deliver an elite-free America. Your political job is to make peace between the elites and everybody else. Swearing at the elites won't do it.-Swearing and generating more prejudice and anger will ruin what needs to get done in your country. With all the free speech in the world, groups of people in your country who don't like each other still have to co-operate. If they just sling obscenities at each other, your country will decline. Politicians exist to throw balm on troubled waters.-Politicians have to represent their country to others. Career politicians know that people in other countries do not want to hear you maximize your freedom of speech. Even the most nationalistic America has distinct limits on its world power. Fling obscenities at other countries and they will not deal with you. They will deal with the People's Republic of China, Iran and Russia instead. International relations means saying nice things, even if the politician saying those compliments doesn't for one moment believe in what they are saying.Donald Trump is an experiment. Can a bad-tempered, old, fairly average guy successfully run the USA?It feels good to swear when you get provoked. You are providing a sort of catharsis for your base. But then, you can't do what society needs politicians to do.It is understandable why people don't like career politicians. Face it though, you need them. A swearing old guy won't get the job done for you and not even for his base.Martin LevineIs Filipino culture synonymous or compatible with Mexican or any other South American culture?January 5, 2018No. I say this having lived in Manila for a couple of years and going back for temporary work later.The majority of Filipinos are members of the Malay ethnocultural group. The Malays are a very numerous group of people. They also comprise most of the population of Indonesia and of course, Malaysia. There is a significant Chinese origin minority. Then there are a small number of indigenous peoples, mainly in the mountains of Luzon.What tends to mislead people is the overlay of Hispanic culture from the long Spanish colonial period in the Philippines, from 1521 to 1898. A substantial number of Spanish words entered into some of the Filipino languages (There are more than one.) Many Filipinos have Spanish sounding first names and surnames.However the Spanish period ended in December, 1898, when the United States bought the country and its inhabitants, from Spain. The Spanish language and Hispanic customs began to fade out, although many Filipinos retained their faith in the Roman Catholic Church.Far Away and Too Difficult to SettleThe Philippines is very far from Latin America, thousands of kilometres across the Pacific. It is half a world away from Spain.Parts of Latin America offer a climate not so different from Spain. The Philippines definitely doesn't. The Philippines are a set of tropical islands and quite mountainous in parts. There isn't all that much usable land. The Philippines is very prone to devastating typhoons as well as violent earthquakes.Gold and Silver were irresistible lures for Spanish settlers in the Americas. The Philippines didn't have it.The Philippines has never had large amounts of European settlement. The effort to do this type of colonization, so very far away, in an inhospitable climate, just wasn't worth it. Any effort to displace the native Malay Filipinos from their land would have been met with ferocious resistance. The Filipinos would have resorted to guerrilla warfare, striking back from the many jungles and mountains.The Philippines had Peninsulares and Mestizos, as in Mexico, but their cultural identity as a distinct group, faded.Tough People in a Tough PlaceThe Philippines never had the equivalent of the Aztec or Inca Empires. There was no urban, stratified civilizations for Spanish conquistadores to strike a devastating blow to, collapse local authority structures and cultures and demoralize the local population into submission. There weren't books and chronicles to burn.The Filipinos were and to some extent remain tribal peoples. Their ancestors arrived in the Philippine Islands by boat. These different groups of settlers carved out different domains, with different languages. They had chieftains, not emperors. This simple, resilient type of social structure is very hard to crush. Spain was dealing with tough people in a very tough environment. They were not able to destroy the local languages. Spain had the power to enforce its control on the Philippines but not sufficient power to impose a new, Spanish culture that would supplant the existing ones.The Spaniards were able to conquer most of Latin America except Brazil. There was nothing similar that they could achieve in the vicinity of the Philippines. The Malays of what are now Indonesia and Malaysia remained beyond their reach. Roman Catholicism threw a wedge between the Filipinos and the mostly Muslim Malays to the east and south of them, but the bond was never totally broken.According to Wikipedia, “ There are approximately 1.5 million Filipinos with pure Chinese ancestry, or around 1.8% of the population. In addition, Sangleys—Filipinos with at least some Chinese ancestry—comprise a substantial minority of the Philippine population, although the actual figures are not known.”https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ch...The Philippines is only a few hundred kilometres from mainland China and Taiwan. The Chinese culture is evidently much more ancient than that of the current Spain. The Chinese community of the Philippines is not a huge part of the population but they survived to provide much of the business and professional leadership. They were not Hispanisized out of cultural existence.The USA Comes and Spanish Influence Slips AwayFilipinos can be very forgiving. The new American colonists brutalized the Filipinos in a savage war. However, after the war the Filipinos were remarkably quick to adopt certain parts of American culture. The Filipinos learned English with impressive speed. When I lived in Manila I was quite puzzled to find diners, replete with milkshakes and hamburgers. Some of this may have had to do with America having massively more economic power than Spain and the ability to establish large military bases, which generated some local employment.Wikipedia has a description of the American colonial period. After the initial brutality it turned relatively benign:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hi...)I think the Filipinos put the cruelty behind them and accepted that many Americans were of good will. Living in Manila I found that most Filipinos wanted a better future for their country, not to dwell upon the past. Once the Japanese invasion was defeated, the Americans honoured their promise to set the Philippines free.The Cultural ResultThe now independent Filipinos had little nostalgia for the Spanish colonial period. They put Spanish behind them, designated Tagalog as a somewhat artificial national language but kept English, an internal peacekeeping move that prevented non-Tagalog speakers from becoming too angry.Spain had little to offer the Philippines. English offered many migrant Filipinos a doorway to a more prosperous life, in the USA, Canada and Britain. Filipino ties with those countries grew.In my view the Filipinos most resemble Pacific Islanders. However a Filipino is likely to tell you, in a polite way, to mind your own business. They have to make their peace with Asia. Filipinos are above all realists.When I look at the modern Philippines, it is striking how much it doesn't resemble Latin America. When you look at the country's history there isn't much reason it should.Martin LevineWhich nation is a ""salad bowl"", and which is a ""melting pot"", with regards to the US and Canada?January 2, 2018Neither is. These old definitions are not realistic. I have submitted Answers that address this general issue before.What Does Long-Term Ethnicity Mean?The concepts of integration and assimilation are not very precise. There does not seem to be any standard definition. However these two concepts both address the idea of how much a given individual whose culture is different from the presumed “mainstream” culture of the place they now live, gets absorbed by that culture.Find That MainstreamThis is not necessarily so easy. A cultural mainstream can exist on shifting economic, political and shifting sands. There can be competing mainstreams in one country or province.Canada is the easiest for me to talk about. I have spoken before about how at least parts of mainstream culture in English-speaking culture in Canada have become quite split. Well-educated, urban Canada has developed a powerful culture based on political correctness, feminism, multiculturalism, social programming, gender-preference equality, equity and affirmative action, healthy lifestyles and strict, strict secularism.I like to present the Province of Alberta as the nemesis of this culture. Alberta has a strong macho, Protestant-oriented, homophobic, free enterprise, rather racist and, well, rodeo, flapjack and barbecue culture.Now, here you are, a recently-arrived immigrant from the People's Republic of China, settling in Alberta. If you were a skilled immigrant, you had to pass an English test. You have been advised that Canada has a British-based, parliamentary democratic system of government. The common-law, precedent-based, adversarial, jury-based legal system has been explained to you. You have thought it through. You can handle it.But what about that Alberta, Pentecostal, chuck wagon, don't much like uppity visible minorities, women keep house, thing? You are still in Canada. Calgary and Edmonton have sizable islands of politically-correct people. You might feel more comfortable with them. Or, maybe, while you focus on establishing yourself economically you just put these cultural issue off. Calgary and Edmonton have quite substantial, multi generational Chinese communities, with many highly-educated, successful, professional people. There is a very good subculture available to you. You have a certain alternative in order to sign off out of the Alberta-Canada culture war.And, this goes on from generation to generation, not just for immigrants. I myself am no exception. My grandparents arrived from Russia into Manitoba sometime around 1900. However I am still Martin, the Judeo-ex-Winnipeger. I am not cattle roundup, steer roping material but I am not an ideal advertisement for politically correct Canadian feminism. Jewish-Canadians getting on young enough to be my grandchildren still go to synagogue, get Bar Mitvahs, eat rye bread, and, some even keep kosher.What if the Mainstream Doesn't Want You?What if the mainstream culture decides that they are the only salad in town and you are not going to get in it, no matter how much you might want to taste like a radish or a bean sprout?Historically, Canadian culture meant ethnicity, British or French. There is nothing necessarily aberrant or wrong about this. Canada was, explicitly, British North America. “British” just wasn't just a play word. “British” has a lot to do with valiant Scottish-Canadians, bagpiped and kilt-clad, very courageously defending Canada and its Royal Family in wars against aggression, principally from nasty Germans. There is nothing in the least wrong with this. And, no, I am not suggesting that Scottish-Canadians lack generosity of spirit, anything but. Much of their leadership in Canadian society is exemplary. I'm grateful that they're here.However I can admire but I can't be Scottish. It's just a fact that, regarding certain parts of mainstream culture, my nose will remain pressed against the Canadian window. I don't see this as an excessively high price for being Canadian. And like my Chinese-Canadian friends, I always have my synagogue, my delicatessen and my local B'Nai Brith chapter if I need to socialize.But How About That American Golden Door?I think the USA has really put the melting pot behind it. In particular Afro-American and Hispanic Americans have made it quite clear that there are parts of their own cultures that they aren't going to let melt.The United States Constitution established an America of principles, not an ethno-based America, even though, just like in Canada, people of British origin have tended to dominate.Life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness provide a certain no-melt entitlement. The USA doesn't even have an official language.I think the melting pot concept applies in particular to a period during the late 1800's and early 1900's, when the USA was struggling to integrate massive numbers of immigrants. Maybe Jewish immigrants too special note of it, and, faithful to our Jewish traditions, decided to do some intellectualizing about what it all meant.However, what did it all really include? It meant learn English in public school, in Grade 1. It meant schoolchildren started their morning by pledging allegiance to the flag. It created a situation where a Jewish person could become a justice of the Supreme Court. But it wasn't a free ticket to the country club and identifiably Jewish folks didn't get to be in Peyton Place, Bruce Willis films and a whole lot of other American things. (On the flip side a fair number of us got to produce and direct stuff.)Aside from us, Italian-Americanism, Polish-Americanism, Irish-Americanism and other White-ethnicisms never came to a flat stop. If they had, America would have been a much blander and maybe less successful place. Imagine the contemporary USA without the heritage of Frank Sinatra, Bobby Vinton, Dean Martin, John Travolta, Arnold Schwarzenegger, the Kennedy Brothers, hot dogs, frankfurters, pizza, smorgasbord buffets, etc.But Now, Surely, It's All The Same?The Internet and its social media are with us. Won't they be a social mixer-blender, and turn us all into one protein shake smoothie?It doesn't seem that way, not even in the US and certainly not in Canada.If anything the social media allow one to declare one's heritage and principals to the world, and, if one is in the mood, get into a fight. Look at Quora!Amongst other things the Internet and the social media promote culture wars and lots of outrage for those who enjoy so much being outraged. One almost wishes the social media were just for pictures of your pet cat doing funny things, music video streams and hookups. However a lot of what happens in the social media are cultural, racial and ideological cannonballs getting fired.Assimilate or Integrate to What?Canada and the USA both have a social bottom line that the whole population are expected to more or less accept. These are, legal or informal main languages, accepting the validity of popularly-elected legislatures, letting courts decide interpersonal disputes, not violating the criminal code, working for a living, etc.However both countries have a fringe who don't believe in these things, maybe a fair-sized fringe in the USA.Those things are not a full cultural package that one can happily sink into. Life in either country is not a full, go with the flow melt, or choosing to remain cultural rhubarb. Neither country offers either a full all in or all out package. Melting pot versus salad doesn't mean much.Martin LevineWhat are some things Europeans don't understand about the US when discussing politics, and vice versa?January 1, 2018I lived in Austria for three years and saw the bewilderment up close.The Straits of Dover are Wider than the Atlantic OceanPart of the European lack of understanding of the USA is lack of understanding of the British world. Some Americans may want to pillory me but the USA is still a country based on British political principles. The American Revolution did not divorce the USA from the Magna Carta, habeus corpus, the concept of freehold land title, guilty until proven innocent, freedom of speech, jury trial, common law, the adversarial legal system, etc.These principles were developed over a very long period of time in England and were transferred to the USA. Some of the major European countries did not start to become democratic until much, much later, after a revolution against absolute monarchy. When they did, they created democratic systems based on Roman law, without the primacy of precedent and with investigative judges. This all requires a civil code. Europeans don't necessarily accept that a country doesn't need one.Europeans Don't Get FederalismOther than Switzerland none of the European countries are full federal systems. Most of them have strongly unitary, powerful, national governments. The idea of provinces and states with their own sovereignty, and without the right of the national government to overrule the decisions of local governments, is foreign. Europeans will keep looking for some American national law or policy, becoming increasingly frustrated when they don't find one.The misconceptions extend to how law enforcement works in the United States. Some European countries have national gendarmeries, tightly-controlled from the national capital, with very uniform officer training and promotional standards. Local police forces don't exist. Neither do local police chiefs. The concept of electing judges and sheriffs is completely foreign.Compared to a European country the USA is Huge and Very Politically DiverseThe USA is something in the order of fourteen times the size of France. It has a climate that extends from arctic to tropical. Ethnicities vary from one state to the next.A European may have struggle to understand why Californians produce different political responses than Alabamans. Your European doesn't necessarily have an in-depth knowledge of American geography and history. Something in one state, usually a southern one, catches their attention, and to them that's America. Open carry at a Texas Walmart is much more exciting than a debate about national medical insurance at some college town in Vermont.Separate Church from State, But You Really Like ReligionEuropeans tend to have a rather jaded attitude towards religion. Most of the European countries had state churches. These churches were an intrinsic part of the national political power structure and, frequently, its political oppression systems. Many Europeans would tell you that religious beliefs, of any kind, have no role in state affairs.How can a European understand a country that preaches separation of church and state but where people love religion? How can they understand a situation where the faith-based political views of a pastor are valued and considered highly credible?Not Much Social Class But Lots of Race and Plenty of Wedge CultureThe struggle between a self-identifying working class and the ill-intentioned, extremely exploitative, high bourgeoisie is central to European politics. There is a strong tendency in Europe to believe that this struggle is the basis of all political life.Europeans looking at America will try to identify which party represents the “worker”. At first it seems to be the Democrats but the Democrats have no real quarrel with Big Business. Then, the European might like to think the workers of America are deluded.No European country has the racial and subcultural history of the United States. Europeans don't necessarily know American demographics. They don't understand that the Afro-American population of the USA is greater than that of the total population of most European countries and that the Hispanic population is greater than that of all of Spain.Europe has a rather strong tradition of cultural centralization. The national government establishes a central language and suppresses local languages and local dialects. In the case of some European countries, if the existence of a given ethnic subculture is just too unbearable, well, kill them.The concept of a racial or a subcultural identity overriding the politics of social class and education is hard for some Europeans to accept or simply incomprehensible.Love that Intelligentsia!Europeans love their intellectuals. Left-wing Europeans love their left-wing intellectuals.Early on in my Austrian life I learned that Austrians love anything that sounds professorial or artistic, as long as it is pompous.In Europe the Intelligentsia play the leadership role that is carried on by TV evangelists and talk show hosts in the USA.There goes your European, looking for the intellectual elite of the USA. And, they can't find any.In Europe Populist Equals NaziIt's just historically the fact that, in Europe, populism tends strongly to produce mass murders and devastating, aggressive wars. The Europeans don't get why Americans so much like populism. The American concept of blowing off cultural steam is challenging.In Europe right-wing, lesser-educated people aren't generally considered amusing and endearing and one wouldn't make up sit coms about them. There really wouldn't be a Euro Beverly Hillbillies or a rural France Dukes of Hazzard. If Daisy Dukes existed in France, a Parisian couture house would have to approve them before young women would put them on.How can Europeans envision Gomer Pyle? How many would openly admit that they would like to do a chair-throw on the Jerry Springer show? Personally I think some envy and jealousy is happening here.There is a widely-accepted principle in Europe that individual working class and rural people need to shut up. Their collective interests are quite adequately represented by their labour union and the French farmers’ association. Some Europeans don't get it when American “Rednecks” speak.Money Talks and Everybody WalksPutting together the European Union, or breaking bits off, has been a struggle. Europe has cultural barriers that interfere with Europe being Europe. No European exceptionalism, no Euro house on the hill. Instead, Greek debt and weird Italian politics, the Germans looking down on everything and everybody, Bratwurst triumphing over spaghetti.And there's America, three strikes and you are out from Miami to Fairbanks. That same TV commercial, in the same language, will work from Atlantic to Pacific. Frito-Lay can sell the same corn chips just as well in Maine as in Arizona.The same for culture. Seinfeld commercials sold stuff nation-wide. Culture means big business, not a state-funded symphony orchestra. America is business for the sake of business.This more or less culturally uniform, immense national market produces a commercial and political dynamic that is not known in Europe. American commerce makes huge money. It is not at all hard to make an enormous campaign contribution and buy yourself some serious friends in Washington, D.C. never mind your local state legislature. A few million bucks is a lot more important than a banner-waving political protest or an erudite political argument in your local prestige newspaper.You Ain't Just Whistling DixieFeel proud the South, you are America.A European who really works at it might get Boston, but they are not going to get Tuscaloosa. To a European the old Confederacy can easily drown out anything else about the USA.One struggles to understand what one can't and forgets about stuff you think you've already aced. The South is very good at being absolutely incomprehensible. Southerners are assertive and speak up a lot. They do religions that never happened in Europe. Lots of other Americans view them with warmth and affection, the patriotic Americans who fought the good fight.So, there's that land of cotton. A European can be just as snide as they want but the USA calls a whole lot of shots,worldwide. What happens when the USA seems to radiate outward from Jackson, Mississippi? The political views of those Mississippians can get a nasty President elected. A European can intellectualize themselves into a migraine headache but none can comprehend the political views of those powerful Mississippians.Liverpool is the Bridge to Very Limited UnderstandingI have lived in Britain too. The British comprehend America far more than a Euro-mainlander could and can explain a little bit.As a personal view, without the British to translate, Europeans would comprehend America even less than they already do. After Brexit we may be back to Jerry Lewis versus Marie-Antoinette.And, the Vice Versa?I use the above arguments to explain just as much why Americans don't get European politics.However this is not a physics equation. There's a serious power imbalance. Why pay attention to people who aren't that important when there's other people you really like to worry about?You can sell Vladimir Putin on American TV and Alt-Right websites. What Vladimir thinks, matters, big-time. Vladimir is just as Asian as he is any type of European. Vladimir extends to Vladivostok.When the People's Republic of China tells America to mind its manners CNN will do a national US shudder. Mess with North Korea and get nuked. When Iran draws a line in the sand even Donald Trump is going to think really seriously about whether he wants to cross it.Get You Behind Me, EuropeI know Europeans hate it but, I think when you ask Americans to pay attention to Europe, most Americans reflexively think, what for and who the hell cares? Europe is where your grandparents might have come from but you put it behind you and got on with real life. An American doesn't need to care about local politics in Wallonia. Americans have a whole lot of complicated American stuff on their political minds. If you have any spare time to think about foreign affairs, focus on those big nasties. Vladimir is out there and he can really hurt you.Martin LevineADDITIONAL MATERIAL January 1, 2018:re “So what’s your view on how we ended up with more of a Euro attitude regarding religion and politics?”I think the USA is really the odd country out in terms of mixing religion and politics. Canada is more or less par for the course.The USA has circumstances that don’t at all apply in Canada or the rest of the western industrial world. The South in particular has a highly-emotive religious tradition that supports lower-class whites in justifying their racial dominance. The southern religious culture also seems to have a tradition that permits repeated episodes of repentance interspersed with sin. So, you can go looking for those honky-tonk women in between very emotional expressions of remorse at your favourite church. For poor whites this is attractive. Don’t question, don’t criticize but, have some fun.The southern religion tradition applied to the Afro-American churches but with an additional theology of intense suffering, local pastors relating very closely to the extremely harsh, Afro-American experience. This keeps people loyal to a church and Black suffering applied in urban areas too. Singing exuberantly in the church choir and highly-emotive prayer help.While Canada eventually chose not to have a state religion, the tradition of established churches was very strong here. However, that became a trap for the religiously enthusiastic. Canada, like Europe ended up with entrenched, career-oriented church bureaucracies. Theological fervour took a back seat to a good pension and letting your parishioners have a comfortable pew. Spewing out fire and brimstone can threaten a clergyperson’s job security.Rural areas were the home of fervent religion in Canada too, but compared to the USA, our rural populations are quite thin. Our frigid climate doesn’t allow for annual multicrop, high yield harvests. Canada urbanized and rural areas depopulated during a very compressed period period of time, compared to the USA, starting in the 1950’s. There was no way for religion to keep up.Canadian Anglicanism is really an ethnic church. They couldn’t readily take advantage of immigrant arrivals to bolster their numbers. For that matter the United Church is really ethnic too, a fusion of English and Scots strict, unemotive, religious traditions. Unlike Southern Baptism and Evangelicalism, these religions weren’t prepared to allow for some fun in between repentances. Here you are, a member of the United Church, or a low Anglican, plucked from the farms and small towns of Southern Ontario into the temptations of Toronto. Your church won’t cut you any slack. What do you do?Catholicism in Quebec self-extracted from Quebec society. It preached subarctic agricultural colonies as a more moral alternative than going to work for les Anglais in Montreal. This inflicted suffering. And then, the church elite sided with Maurice Duplessis and those Anglais bosses. The Church inflicted more suffering on these newly-urbanized Quebecois. When the Church did that the Quiet Revolution was a no brainer.The United Church is an interesting case of a top-down organization getting hijacked. In my opinion any religion exists primarily to provide moral instruction based on a deity’s commands and on celebrating and providing solace for the good and sad events of human life. However what happens when a church starts to feel that celebration and comforting its faithful in the face of life’s vicissitudes is, well, tacky? Of course if you have a degree in theology, iron-clad job security and are sure of a dignified retirement your potential for empathy for those who don’t can dwindle down to little or nothing.Canada has a church-based Fabian socialist tradition. However I think particularly in the United Church it has been badly abused. Left-wing politics was a lot more fun than listening to a mother’s tears when her child had passed away, helping her with prayers and assuring her that a good, moral life was sure to reunite her with her child before Jesus Christ in heaven. Doing politics makes you feel big. You can define who the nasty others are in Canadian society (so often my ethnic group) and impose your high criticism, benefiting a bit from the British colonial tradition.Canada’s major churches didn’t want to deal with the tough stuff in everyday Canadian life. “Jobs for the boys” (and later on the girls) took precedence. No wonder so many Canadians lost interest in religion.MartinHow did the White Anglo Saxon male dominate the world? No other male has shaped the world more than him.December 2017, 2017I can't resist answering this question whether I get hate mail or not. And, I don't at all see this question as a troll.I have lived in London, England. These are not just the fantasies of an elderly Judeo-Canadian.The term “Anglo-Saxon” gets used and confused. The core meaning refers to the descendants of migrants from northern Germany and Denmark who entered Britannia and subjugated the indigenous Celtic population after the Roman legions withdrew from Great Britain.The Anglo-Saxons seem to have assimilated the previous Brythonic (Proto Welsh) population culturally and genetically. At one time it was thought that the Anglo-Saxons had genocided the Britons but apparently modern DNA evidence seems to indicate that the the Britons were absorbed into the Anglo-Saxon gene pool. Just their culture got genocided.The Scandinavians began raiding Britain in the 800's and eventually invaded it and established the Danelaw. However this was a minority of Scandinavian invaders being bred into the Anglo-Saxon population.Then came the Normans. However who were they? They were Vikings who had picked up some French. There weren't a lot of extra women in Normandy to bring to England. These were mostly guys. They had no choice but to marry local ladies.But, Remember Those CeltsBritish isn't the same as Anglo-Saxon. Scots, Welsh and Northern Irish guys aren't English. They're not Anglo-Saxons but there is a tendency to lump them in. When one talks about Britain fighting, I would characterize the English as the sword and those Celtic guys as the sharp edge of the blade.We Live In a Man's World for Rough GuysThis has been the case is most societies beyond the hunter gatherer stage. The United Kingdom hasn't been an exception. Even Queen Elizabeth the First was surrounded by powerful male courtiers. So was Queen Victoria.And who were those Anglo-Saxon males? They were the descendants of invaders, the Anglo-Saxons themselves, then the Vikings, then the Normans. This is a culture with a heritage of raw aggression.Yeah TeamThe original Anglo-Saxons squabbled. The Normans put a quick end to that. In 1066 they hammered England into one country. Those who objected got strung up.This was at a time when Germany and Italy consisted of disparate principalities, the Kings of Paris were in a long-term struggle to conquer the nobles and create a real France, and Spain was a Moorish colony. The English had a couple of civil wars that if anything made your English male even tougher. England stayed a country. When it came to beating on other ethnicities, the males of England were united.Wenching in the Mead Hall, and ElsewhereThis definition is from Dictionary.com - The world’s favorite online dictionary!. I am providing the link for information purposes only:http://www.dictionary.com/browse...I love the examples they give:Historical ExamplesTheir other chief hobby was, in the language of the time, wenching.Rowlandson's OxfordA. Hamilton GibbsWhy, is any business more public than drinking and wenching ?Dryden's Works Vol. 3 (of 18)John DrydenHeads of colleges, reverend clerics, and holders of Fellowships must all answer to the charge of wenching.Rowlandson's OxfordA. Hamilton GibbsBeowulf, symbolically the very first Anglo-Saxon, talked about the Mead Hall:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/He...Oh, c'mon. We know what happened there.I make an assertion, British males still wench. I have been in English pubs and you can't fool me. In the USA they developed an All-American term for wench, “honky-tonk women”.The English male never did get very much into love-dovey romance. They left that to the French and the Italians. English men didn't spend all that much time exalting the ladies. Let's face it, historically the status of women in English society has been rather low.Add in some Methodism and Low Anglicanism. Your wife herself isn't a wench but don't spend a lot of time writing her admiring poems and buying her flowers. Your Missus was there to be fruitful and do your multiplying for you. The English male may not have been masters of the chivalrous arts but they were very good at making their ladies reproduce. The English had no problem building up their population base. This made for a plentiful supply of sailors.Mateship Even before the Australians Invented Ithttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ma...So where did the concept of mateship come into being? Sorry Aussies, you perfected it and made it into a cultural icon but this is an old, old feature of Anglo-Saxon life.First the mead hall, then going down the pub, then the Playing Fields of Eaton. England is the world home of male bonding.The Existential Joy of Male on Male ViolenceSigmund Freud talked about Thanatos. The English don't need to talk about it. They just get into it.I offer you the rugby match. I offer you the fine art of pub brawling. I offer you a good, old-fashioned soccer riot. I offer you being pugnacious in the clubs of Ibiza. I offer you a generous spot of bovver.The English male is not like some recent Germans. He doesn't just see violence as a corporate means to racial domination. He isn't just getting off on sadism. He is looking for his moment of truth. What is better than hurting another male and, getting hurt?Loving violence for itself is a good pathway to world domination. The Americans, so much the children of the Anglo-Saxons, understood. Why is Raging Bull one of the all-time greatest films?The Germans never did get it. Neither did the Japanese. Male on male violence, each male as an equal, beating on the males they want to beat on, for the joy of it, is an expression of personal freedom.The English Make the Industrial Revolution Arrive, FirstEngland had a united market long before Germany. I believe English men applied their tradition of personalized aggression to that market, creating a commercial, scientific and technological world.This guy wasn't at all afraid of pushing his ideas, really hard:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Is...Ironically his father was actually French. However Isambard Kingdom Brunel was English-born and exemplified the English engineer, almost a soldier of technology. There were others like him.Obviously one can argue that other civilizations and their males had dominated the world before the English. However the English competed with each other and rapidly built up both their production technology, both industrial and military. They had the population base. They had the aggression. They had a strong tradition of male teamwork. They conquered and colonized.I am not glorifying this process. Much of it was brutal with a pronounced doctrine of Anglo-Saxon racial superiority. However it worked. The English didn't just conquer the peoples of what is now the developing world. They created the USA, Canada, Australia and New Zealand, Anglo-Saxon based countries. World Wars I and II showed what Anglo male teamwork meant.The Sceptered Isle, the Demi ParadiseAsk that Brexiteer. Ask the English brawlers of Ibiza. Deep down their country is their male team, ready for a spot of bovver with anyone.I Tips Me CapI don't idealize the English colonial period. I don't have any excuse for the murder and cultural genocide inflicted on Canada's aboriginal peoples. I don't need to engage in a pub brawl to validate my manhood.However, I am selfish about who I praise. Here I sit, comfortable in my old age, in my cozy, warm apartment, in Ottawa, where the overnight low will be -16 F. I'm Jewish. Without the aggressive Anglo-Saxon male, ready to team up and fight anyone, I wouldn't be anywhere. I wouldn't exist. If the White Anglo Saxon male team hadn't dominated the world, and put his bovver boot up some absolutely vile people, my parents would not have been around to put their DNA together and make up me.In the balance I am very glad for that dominant Anglo-Saxon male. How horrible would the world have been without them?Martin LevineIf we are not living in a simulation, then where are the aliens? The Universe should be crawling with aliens and we should be picking up alien radio signals also. Don’t you think so?December 26, 2017This frequently asked question is sometimes referred to as the Fermi Paradox. Enrico Fermi, an Italian-American scientist raised it:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fe...The Wikipedia article gives a fairly full explanation. My comments are just a few additional notes.Maybe They're Really Not ThereIt seems quite certain now with so many exoplanets being discovered that our galaxy is rife with planets. However most of the planets that have been detected aren't earth like and seem quite unlikely to support life as we note it. Numerous Hot Jupiters exist.Personally, I think the use of the term “Superearth” is unfortunate. The term seems to suggest that there are many planets that are maybe a bit bigger than Earth but are perfectly habitable just the same. When you look closer at the discoveries some of these planets have crushing gravity and are likely to have very dense atmospheres. I haven't yet seen any scientific articles describing how likely it is that basic, single-celled life could come into being when gravity is four times that of earth and water is under that type of pressure.We haven't seen very many discoveries of planets that are really earth-sized, with comparable gravity, in the “Goldilocks Zone” of their star. There may be a confirmation bias because it takes a few years to confirm that a planet, with a year similar in length to the earth, exists. However we have been able to detect extrasolar planets for a few years and time is running on.We have seen planets detected around Red Dwarfs and even neutron stars. Would they even count in the search for life as we know it?So, Life Starts But How Far Does It Get?I haven't seen any scientific articles that estimate how likely it is that once single-celled life exists, it will transition to multicellular life. We don't know. The Earth apparently had its “Boring Billion” period. We don't know what ended it.Then, let's take it in stages:-If multicellular life comes into existence does it migrate from the sea to the land?-If it makes it to land does it slither or does it develop appendages?-How large does it get?-How intelligent does it need to be to survive in its environment?-Does it become sentient?-If it becomes sentient, does it remain a hunter-gatherer society?-If it becomes agrarian does it develop relatively complex civilizations? This presumes that the planet have plants and animals that can be domesticated.-If it develops complex civilizations are they oriented towards continuous scientific and technological advances. Or do they stop, like the Roman, Chinese and Mayan Empires did?-If those civilizations advance how long do they stay at the electromagnetic stage of communications? Do they move on to other means, for example quantum phenomena or gravitational waves?So, you might start with a billion planets and end up with just a handful that have civilizations that emit radio waves for a certain period of time.Are We That Great at Detecting Radio Waves?I haven't seen scientific articles that assert that we can readily overhear routine radio and television broadcasts on an extrasolar planet. We haven't the technology yet. What if the nearest emitting planet is a thousand light years away? Would we hear anything but background noise and static?Most of the detection scenarios focus on another civilization beaming a powerful, tight signal right at us in the hope of communicating. Why would they bother to beam it at us? What dialogue could they expect to have when it takes years for radio signals to get from one star to another? Would it be worth the energy cost and effort?What if Warp Drive is Impossible?Any Trekky hopes passionately that Warp Drive will be developed. However what if physics doesn't allow it? What value would any civilization find in attempting to communicate with another one they can never visit, trade with or invade?Currently, Our Chances of Detecting a Radio Signal are MinusculeGiven all of the above, our chances of detecting an extrasolar radio signal, approach being insignificant, at least for now. This may not be the case forever. The human race is still scientifically and technically progressing. There is still the possibility that we will develop electromagnetic sensing technology so sensitive that it might be able to overhear what may only be the handful of broadcasting civilizations out there.Not Detecting Radio Doesn't Necessarily Mean They Aren't ThereNot detecting radio signals is not at all the same as being certain “they” are not there.Think about Star Trek. Communicating in the radio spectrum we know would be useless to Starfleet. They use subspace radio, which seems to be instantaneous no matter how many light years you are away from their headquarters in San Francisco.If Warp Drive actually does exist a civilization using it would not use radio and TV for long distance communications. We are not going to hear Captain Kirk using it.If homo sapiens does develop warp drive we are going to need to develop subspace radio too.Here's a scenario. It is five years after NASA has confirmed that Warp Drive is practical. The USA has built the Enterprise, absolutely 0000A.We wait until we get subspace radio right. Then being appropriately cautious NASA does not send the Enterprise dashing headlong into the cosmos, potentially smacking straight into the Borg. Rather, NASA parks it at the outer edge of the Kuiper Belt, well away from the whatever subspace interference our solar system produces.Then, they turn the subspace radio on, and hear a whole bunch of people in passing spaceships, snarling away in Klingon and Romulan. That Enterprise needs to turn the hell around and head straight back to NASA headquarters before our presence is noticed. Then NASA, DARPA, the Sandia National Laboratories, etc. need to work on creating phasers and photon torpedoes.Deep Down We Know They are Already HereI am quite skeptical about UFO encounters. Doubtless most of them are hoaxes and misunderstandings of natural or man-made phenomena.However, there's that hard core:http://www.cnn.com/2017/12/19/us...This is alarming. We are looking at a visual record on United States Navy equipment. There has been no rebuttal from the United States military. There have been others like this. Where is the dismissive explanation? Are these all swamp gas and weather balloons?What can we conclude? There is a rather strong chance that those aliens are there and are visiting us rather regularly. They might not feel any interest in getting a discussion with the earthly population. Their visits may have a benign purpose to which we are completely irrelevant.I think an answer to this question must include some humility. The only civilizations that we can detect may be Warp-capable ones who have no need to talk to us. I could be wrong in my estimate and there could be thousands of them. However it's just too early for us. We aren't ready to be in their world.Martin LevineHow do Canadians view Great Britain?December 22, 2017There are a fair number of Canadians who don't view anything much more than daily life but I suppose you could say that for people everywhere.However, for those of us Canadians who do view Great Britain, we view the place somewhat more up close than people from a lot of other places.I should confess, I lived in London for three years. I was married to a British lady, disastrously towards the end of our relationship. My son is a British citizen and lives there.I should also note, I can really only speak about English-speaking Canada. Quebec would likely have a different perspective.The Maple Leaf ForeverThis is the traditional view:As the song says (I have adjusted some spelling to respect my own cultural sensitivities):In days of yore, from Britain's shore,Wolfe, the dauntless hero, cameAnd planted firm Britannia's flagOn Canada's fair domain.Here may it wave, our boast, our prideAnd, joined in love together,The thistle, shamrock, rose entwineThe Maple Leaf forever!Chorus:The Maple Leaf, our emblem dear,The Maple Leaf forever!G-d save our Queen and Heaven blessThe Maple Leaf forever!At Queenston Heights and Lundy's Lane,Our brave fathers, side by side,For freedom, homes and loved ones dear,Firmly stood and nobly died;And those dear rights which they maintained,We swear to yield them never!Our watchword evermore shall be""The Maple Leaf forever!""ChorusOur fair Dominion now extendsFrom Cape Race to Nootka Sound;May peace forever be our lot,And plenteous store abound:And may those ties of love be oursWhich discord cannot sever,And flourish green o'er freedom's homeThe Maple Leaf forever!ChorusOn merry England's far famed landMay kind heaven sweetly smile,G-d bless old Scotland evermoreand Ireland's Em'rald Isle!And swell the song both loud and longTill rocks and forest quiver!G-d save our Queen and Heaven blessThe Maple Leaf forever!ChorusNote, “G-d bless old Scotland evermore”15% of the population of Canada is wholly or partially of Scots origin. About 14% of the population are of Irish origin but a lot of them are Ulstermen.Out of the more or less 36,000,000 Canadians maybe 7,000,000 are francophone. While some francophone Canadians have Scots and Irish roots the great majority of the Celts above are English-speaking Canadians. There's a bit over 9,000,000 Scots and Irish-Canadians, so about 31% of English-speaking Canada.In Canada, Scotland rocks. Significant numbers of Canadians know what a Sasanach is.A quite sizable part of the English-speaking Canadians are Ulstermen. Historically the Loyal Orange Order was very influential in Canada. Toronto used to pride itself as the “Belfast of North America”.Most non British people who view Great Britain view Piccadilly Circus first. However a Canadian might first want to view the splendours of Edinburgh and the Royal Military Tattoo. The Celtic world matters.The Challenge of Coronation StreetCoronation Street is available more or less daily on Canadian TV. Having lived in Britain and visited Manchester on several occasions I sort of see it is a fictionalized documentary.However, much of Canada's British-origin population comes historically from rural England, not the cities. I have the sense that many English people who immigrated to Canada from English cities after the Second World War wanted to put Coronation Street behind them.In Canada, “working class” as a social identity has been determinedly suppressed. Canadians can puzzle over both the TV program and contemporary British people who are just like it. You might say there is considerable Canadian affection for Coronation-type English people but most Canadians who don't originate from the dark and satanic mills parts of England have some difficulty understanding.On the reverse side a large part of even the most dyed in the wool, British-origin Canadians, don't understand what an “upper class toff” is.It would be so much easier if Britain just consisted of picturesque, thatched cottage, bagpipe villages, where the Spice Girls every so often drop by at the local pub.No, A Spoon Full of Sugar Does Not Make the Medicine Goes DownWalt Disney couldn't put anything past us Canadians. We're up too close to believe in 101 Dalmatians. No Bedknobs and Broomsticks! And, Mary Poppins does not describe your average female Brit.Canadians often enjoying sentimentalizing about Britain but we want to sentimentalize about real British things. Let's sentimentalize the monarchy, Winston Churchill, Mods and Rockers, Atomic Kitten, etc. Sentimentalize Charles Dickens if you want but some Canadians understand that he was preaching against intense social injustice and grief.You Always Liked the Australians BetterBritain loves Australia. The Australians reciprocate despite the Bloody Pom talk.We know the British don't like us the same way, except maybe for the millions of Brits who have moved here. Unrequited love hurts. Royal visits are good fun but it would be nice to get some affection from the British masses.OK. Canada doesn't have Bondi Beach. It didn't have Kylie Minogue, her sister, Natalie Imbruglia and various other highly strung celebrities. We don't have Nicole Kidman, Cate Blanchett, Mel Gibson (Very fortunately. If he opened his mouth here he'd be prosecuted.), Russell Crowe, Iggy Azelia (Or is that our Canadian good taste?), etc.Alright, maybe British people have a point. If they heard us whinge they'd probably tell us that, if us Canadians want their affection, we have to work a lot harder at getting it.Canadians View and Enjoy Not Getting ItThe British are good at mystifying us. What Canadian can understand?:-Theresa May-Ed Sheeran-The Beckham Family-The border between the Republic of Ireland and our ancestral Ulster-Devolution-Why English people find Polish people absolutely terrifying? (In Canada we'd invite them to the Folklorama Festival, drink the vodka and eat the pickles.)-And the English dread multiculturalism too-The Sun newspaper-Actually, all of Fleet Street and ITV.-Food on British trains.-Why so many British B. and B.'s are determined to imitate Fawlty Towers?Some Canadians know how to deal with the incomprehension. View, don't be so arrogant as to expect to understand and marvel.So, You're Back from Outer SpaceCanadians who bother to watch the news watch Brexit.Britain sort of dumped Canada when it went into the EU. Some of us would like to know, do the British want us back? Is Heathrow Airport going to put us in the welcome, no customs for you, no immigration line?Will it be, just pick up your bags and mind the gap?We view. We wait. A lot of us wish the British the best, jilted love or not. We haven't heard the last of Britain and we are glad to view Britain again and again.Martin LevineWhat is cultural relativity, and do you agree with it?December 19, 2017Wikipedia gives more information about what cultural relativity means than I could hope to.https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cu...My answer yesterday to “Is judging a culture bigotry?” relates strongly to this question.Asserting Universal ValuesSome religions and traditions assert that there are universal human values that every adult human being ought to know and abide by. I am suspicious of this assertion except with regard to very abstract human values. Even there, it is highly questionable how much even those values are universally held.The Ten CommandmentsHere is a moral code that contributes considerably to a number of different cultures. The following are the Ten Commandments, translated from Hebrew, at:http://www.chabad.org/library/ar...Chabad is a Jewish, Chassidic organization. The words L-rd and G-d are spelled that way because Orthodox Judaism prohibits the spelling out of the full names of the Eternal One.I am the L rd your G d, Who brought you out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage.You shall have no other gods before Me. You shall not make for yourself a graven image, nor any manner of likeness of anything that is in heaven above, that is in the earth beneath, or that is in the water under the earth. You shall not bow down to them, nor serve them. For I the L rd your G d am a jealous G d, visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children of the third and fourth generation of them that hate Me; and showing mercy unto the thousandth generation of them that love Me and keep My commandments.You shall not take the name of the L rd your G d in vain; for the L rd will not hold him guiltless that takes His name in vain.Remember the Sabbath Day, to keep it holy. Six days you shall labor and do all your work; but the seventh day is a Sabbath unto the L rd your G d. On it you shall not do any manner of work—you, your son, your daughter, your man-servant, your maid-servant, your cattle, and your stranger that is within your gates. For in six days the L rd made heaven and earth, the sea and all that in them is, and rested on the seventh day; wherefore the L rd blessed the Sabbath Day, and hallowed it.Honor your father and mother, so that your days may be long upon the land which the L rd your G d gives you.You shall not murder.You shall not commit adultery.You shall not steal.You shall not bear false witness against your neighbor.You shall not covet your neighbor's house; you shall not covet your neighbor's wife, his manservant, his maid-servant, his ox, his donkey, nor anything that is your neighbor's.When you look at this powerful moral code, you can identify several beliefs that characterize many cultures:Honor your father and mother, so that your days may be long upon the land which the L rd your G d gives you. (It is probably fair to say that most cultures believe in this principle, although the appropriate way to honour your parents might vary.)You shall not murder.You shall not commit adultery.You shall not steal.You shall not bear false witness against your neighbor.You shall not covet your neighbor's house; you shall not covet your neighbor's wife, his manservant, his maid-servant, his ox, his donkey, nor anything that is your neighbor's. (This in a way is saying that one should respect that every person is entitled to their legitimate possessions, although some cultures would now state that your wife, your manservant and your maidservant are not your property.)However. What if in a given culture:-You ought to turn in your parents if they speak against the party in power.-It is quite OK to murder bad people, in fact it is your responsibility.-What if you and your spouse agree that you want swinging and polyamory and your culture has no objection?-Concerning stealing, were Robin Hood, his band of men and Maid Marian bad guys? What if the Sheriff of Nottingham was just trying to enforce English law?-What if your are just creating alternative facts about your neighbour?-What if, in your culture, they don't believe in private property? What if your neighbour is a bad person and got their possessions unfairly and so it is OK for a good person to take it away?To what extent were Nazi Germany, the Soviet Union, revolutionary Cambodia, Mao's China, etc., “cultures”? I would say that they certainly tried to be. If so, a lot of people were behaving in accordance with the values of their culture, even though people in other cultures consider their actions absolutely abhorrent.What Do You Claim Your Culture Is?In some lives, a person travels chronologically through different cultures. The citizens of Nazi Germany had known other times in Germany, when Nazi values did not predominate. Many were Lutherans and Roman Catholics. How many sincerely gave up their previous values and accept the Nazi philosophy? Those who hadn't accepted Nazism were understandably terrified of making their views public.However, leave it a few generations. Russia's October Revolution happened in November, 1917. The Soviet Union lasted until December, 1991. The Soviet Union was very good at keeping out positive information about the culture and values of non-Communist countries. A citizen of the Soviet Union, born in 1960, really might not have had any exposure to other cultures. Their grandparents might have passed on or were scared to say good things about the Russia of the Czar.Then of course there are people who have migrated geographically. At any given time, what culture do they adhere to? Do they have a personal mix that isn't quite representative of their host culture or the “mainstream” of the one in their new culture?As I said in my Answer yesterday, cultures very frequently contain subcultures. A given person or group of people in a given country may have their own culture, which can be quite different from what is presumed to be the mainstream in that country.A unit the size of a nation state quite plausibly may have more than one culture. It also quite likely has people who are culturally conflicted.Do You Want to Judge People?Those who assert that people in other places are “bad”, because their culture is “bad”, are making a statement against cultural relativism. However, their assertion that there are “universal values” that bad cultures are refusing to comply with, is very hard, or impossible, to confirm with facts.Also, when you are judging some person's compliance with their culture as positive or negative in terms of universal values, are you sure what that person's culture is?Do You Want to Judge Cultures?A culture is not a nation-state. To assert that a nation-state represents one culture only, is, very frequently, badly flawed thinking. Using the name of a country to represent a culture is so often an invalid mental shortcut.Before you judge a culture you would have to identify where it is and who is in it. This takes a certain amount of knowledge.Once you have identified a culture, what do you want to judge about that culture? For example do you want to judge:-Whether that culture conforms with what you assert are universal values.-Whether that culture is patriotic.-Whether that culture causes its members to behave in ways that are obviously economically dysfunctional or violate the laws of the nation-state, creates personality disorders or causes members of that culture to attack each other or others to the point where society breaks down.-Whether that culture causes the nation-state it is in to violate international law, attack other countries, forcibly colonize other areas of that nation-state that contain people of a different culture, commit genocide against others or forcibly colonize other countries where there are different cultures.Once You Have Made Your Judgment What Do You Do?If you judge an individual in another culture and another country, they may be beyond their reach. However, if they are in your country, you could report them to the authorities. For example, Canada is meant to be a multicultural country, but federal, provincial and municipal law take precedence over the values of any given culture.If you are a member of the elite in your country, or your country is democratic, you could campaign for more laws to punish people who act out bad deeds because of their bad culture.If you are asserting that an entire culture is bad, and that culture is in your country, how can you ban that entire culture? Should you advocate for legislation that identifies that bad culture and takes measures to disable it? Perhaps you could close certain places of worship, ban the speaking of a given language, make it illegal to advocate for the beliefs and values of that culture, prohibit all schools for teaching anything about that culture, etc.What If You Don't Wish to Judge Another Culture But They Are Coming After You?What if members of a another culture within your country hate you and want to do you harm, even though you are not criticizing or trying to oppress that culture? I believe that it is irrelevant whether you believe that there is a right to cultural relativism or not. A sane person defends themselves, their loved ones, their friends and other members of their own culture.What if that culture has power in another nation-state and is motivating that state to attack or threaten you? You could try to negotiate with that nation state, no matter what you think about the cultures in it. However, otherwise, you may have to deter or even fight that nation-state. Unless you think you can convert the people in the offending culture to different values, this is the only alternative you have. Cultural relativism is irrelevant.Martin LevineIs judging a culture bigotry?December 18, 2017Given some of the discussion on Quora this question is highly relevant. I am commenting from the Canadian point of view. Canada has a Criminal Code and Human Rights laws at both the federal and provincial level that protect members of identifiable groups in society from threats and harrassment.Judge a Culture But Not the Individuals In ItJudging a culture does not create an entitlement to judge the people in it.I have seen a rather common cognitive error. Having identified that a person is living in another culture, the observer still expects that individuals in that other culture should act according to the observer's culture. Otherwise those individuals are seen as “immoral”.If the observer is only familiar with their own culture and assumes or believes their culture's values are “right”, it can be difficult to comprehend or accept that other cultures have values and beliefs that disagree with theirs.I have mentioned in other Answers that Canada has undergone very large-scale cultural changes that began in about the mid-1950's. Before that Canada to a large extent consisted of cultures which adhered to rural, religious-oriented values. However after sixty years or so those old values are mostly gone. Of course Canada is not the only country where this happened.What this means in Canada's case is that much of Canada's population lives in cultures that haven't much to do with the traditional view. One can comment on modern cultures but, any individual behaviour has to be considered with reference to that person's current culture. Saying that that culture must be “immoral”, because people in that culture seem that way badly misses the point.What Do You Call a Culture?A nation state does not necessarily equate to a culture. In the case of Canada it certainly doesn't. It is officially and legally acknowledged in Canada that there are two major cultures, French and English. This doesn't just mean different languages. There are other very significant differences. A criticism on the “culture” of Canada as a whole is misdirected.Within the Canadian-born population there are other cultures that are very different. These are the cultures of Canada's aboriginal peoples. There are distinct aboriginal cultures, not just one. There are Crees, Blackfeet, Haidas, Iroquois, Algonquins, Ojibways, Micmacs, Innu, Inuit and others. Without some detailed knowledge, a criticism of any of these cultures is very uninformed and unfair.We May Live in Subcultures, Not CulturesEven relatively homogeneous populations people still may live in subcultures. To the extent that one can define the “mainstream” culture of that society, there are people there who don't live in it.In a multi-ethnic, bilingual culture like Canada this is even more the case. I am a Jewish Manitoban. My culture, or perhaps subculture, is in some cases rather distant from others in Canada. Add on that I am old and that I am bisexual. I have enormous respect for the British-based values that have made Canada a safe place where Jews and people of all sorts can live and pursue their lives and careers in peace. However my culture would in some ways be very substantially different from those of a Scots-Canadian who is a multi-generational resident of rural Prince Edward Island. (Read “Anne of Green Gables”. Those books are not about me or people like me!)If you wanted to criticise my culture in any realistic way you would have to know a lot about it. And no, I don't think the way some observers might imagine Israelis think. (Israel itself has intense subcultures.) I'm a Manitoba Jew, not an Israeli one. And no, I might not have much in common with an exclusively gay man in Palm Springs or Miami's South Beach. I am very different from them.Walk a Mile in My CultureEvery human being is born with their culture and subculture. Whatever that culture or subculture is, it has to operate in a given economical and physical environment. Before an observer criticizes they should consider what that culture has to deal with.Canada is geographically huge but with a relatively small, thinly dispersed population.Taxpayers in Canada, no matter what their culture, are not willing to pay for someone to live a comfortable, work-free life wherever they happen to be born, because there are no jobs there. I doubt that most cultures would. Social assistance programming will pay for a minimal life and not much more. Recipients of employment insurance benefits are checked and policed for fraud and abuse. Those who deceive run the risk of being prosecuted and cut off.I may be a thousand kilometres from any good jobs that I can do. To have a decent life for myself and my family I have to move there. Would you expect me to visit my parents and my aunts and uncles every day? What if I have moved to Vancouver or Toronto and can barely manage to pay the exorbitant rent? Can I afford to have more people come and live with me?The senior members of my extended family still live in the village I come from. What guidance can they give me about life in a city where I have to commute sixty kilometres each way to get to work?I have moved to a city where I do not know a soul. What should I do to find companions? Arranged marriages no longer exist in most Canadian cultures. There is no one to find me friends. I must do it on my own. I have to operate in the urban reality of that large city. Everyone does. My way of life must bend to that reality.Why Are You Criticizing?What is the point of your criticism of someone else's culture?Are you trying to convince the people in that culture is that their culture is “wrong” and that so, they must change? Are you trying to convince people around the world that, that culture is a “bad” culture, that should be looked upon with disdain and fear? What will any of this accomplish?Are There Any Legitimate Points of Intercultural Criticism?This is difficult and demanding but worth the mental exercise. What does any human need?-They need an economy good enough to feed them decently.-They need at least some medical care.-They need safety and order.-They need to be free of thieves, extortion and corruption. They need protection for their property.-They will require education and then a higher education to do well in life.-While ideas about democracy vary, they need some way to express their needs and suggest ideas and changes without punishment.-They need an opportunity for dignity and to believe their existence is valid and worthwhile.If a person lives in a country that does not provide these things, is it their culture that is at fault? We see religion and non-religion based cultures that preach that all humans deserve the above. However what if the rulers and elites of that country don't care or believe that members of some groups in their country are not deserving? Are we sure that the culture of the people in that country is what is depriving people of their basic needs? Do we believe that the culture of that country is causing that country to deny people in other countries of their needs?I believe that it is legitimate to criticize cultures that cause the country they exist in to deny human needs or the needs of people in other countries. However, unless one understands a culture or a subculture, and the circumstances it has to operate in, the criticism will be unfair. Assuming that a country behaves in a certain way because of the cultures of the mass of the people in it, is often very naive.Criticism of other cultures so as to create contempt or hatred of the people in it is criticism for an evil purpose. It is wrong and violates the values of most cultures and subcultures. People who use cultural criticisms for this purpose themselves deserve to be criticized. I agree with the principle of Canada and many other countries that those people deserved to be condemned and prosecuted.Martin LevineWhy does society need diversity?December 15, 2017All nation state level societies have diversity, even if the population is genetically homogeneous.Differences You Don't Get to ChooseYou can be as racially and ethnically homogeneous as Iceland. However even Icelanders are born different and stay different. Some basic differences that happen in humanity:-Male or Female or Other-Smart or not so smart-Physically dexterous or not so much-With less or more disabilities-Gender preference-Innate capabilities, artistic, sports, intellectual, artistic, etcDifferences You Don't Really Get to ChooseIn any given country one gets born with a particular hand of cards. It can be awfully hard to get dealt another hand:-Poor, middle class or rich-Rural or urban-Educated family or not-Family religious beliefs or noneAnd Then, Choices:-Choice of education if you have choices-Choice of occupation if you have any-Choose your political views, if your country allows you choices, or at least talk about it.-Change your religion if you wish or not have any, if your society allows you choices-Move some place else, if you've got the money and you are allowed.-Choice of lifestyle but I don't mean gender preference. (I'm bisexual. I noticed it when I was eleven. I didn't choose anything. It's a medical reality, not an ideological statement.) However, if your society allows you to express different lifestyle choices, sex-based or not, there will be diversity. Since I recall those times, most hippies were as straight as an arrow. However, they went off to live in communes, staying heterosexual and just as monogamous as a 1950's suburb. By contrast, I could suggest that choosing to move from Ottawa to Winnipeg is a radical lifestyle change.Think about all of the above as a matrix. You get lots of diversity whether you want it or not.So, What Do We Do With Those Diverse Folks?Generally, in any society, the more different you are from the elite, the more diverse you are. Diversity is in the eye of the power-holders.And I am not talking about ethnicity. That is almost an add-on.Show 'Em Who Is BossHitler and Stalin had a classical approach to diversity. Kill anybody who is more diverse than you are ready to put with.Hitler didn't just kill us Jewish folks. If you were a communist or gay, or too critical of anything, you were literally toast. That certainly made German society rather less diverse.However, there's a price to be paid for this method. People who aren't just like you may be useful. They can be slave labourers or just poor workers paid a pittance.Consider George Orwell's classic novel. “1984”. Some 1984 tactics can be used to deal with troublesome people who don't like being quite so diverse and particularly those who want to complain about it. However, even Big Brother had to admit, you need Proles. The Proles don't have to follow the party line. Their job is to work, be poor, be cannon fodder, spend their spare time in pubs and keep quiet. In a way 1984 was about how a totalitarian society manages diversity.Tell Them You are All One Big, Happy FamilyThis is where your ethnic homogeneity comes in. You look the same as everybody else so you aren't diverse at all. Be poor, be a labour organizer in jail, be subject to eugenics, it doesn't matter. You are just the same as the guys on top. You are just a little deluded to think otherwise.Tell Them You Like Them, and Just Want Them to be Happy the Same as You AreThis is more the Canadian approach. We love diversity here. However Canada is a managed society. We don't want angry diversity here. We want happy, joyful, big hug diversity.So, you can be diverse but you get free health care, employment insurance, pensions, subsidized housing, the works. Everybody can get to be middle class because our Prime Minister says so. You're Queer, you get a big hug. You're a woman, you get feminism. You have disabilities, you get workplace accommodation. You're artistic, here's a grant. You're athletic, here's a running track.This approach doesn't really make diversity disappear. However it's a good try. The diversity is down there somewhere but you don't notice it so much.But That Ethnicity!This is an issue whether the ethnics are already there or whether you're letting them in.Myanmar has a not unknown approach to ethnic diversity. Cleanse yourself of those ethnics.However other societies are not quite so extreme. How do you manage ethnics in your social matrix:-Tell them they are not allowed to be different. They have to jam themselves into that matrix. No concessions.-Give a little bit but not much. They can have an ethnic restaurant or a food store. That's where it ends. They have to go into the matrix but add an extra variable, be socially amusing.But how about Canada, we love ethnicity diversity don't we, we would never insist they be the same as our “mainstream”, would we?In a couple of other Answers I pointed out that Canadian multiculturalism has hard limits. Your diversity ends where the School Board, the Bylaw Officer and the Canada Revenue Agency take over, You can speak your heritage language, to other people who want to listen to it. Otherwise, just like anyone else, you can either afford the rent in Toronto or you go live sixty kilometres away in the exurbs. If you aren't too academic and you don't want to be poor you go to that same community college as anyone else.You could call it managed diversity.And, Canadian society will manage your diversity down. You arrive here really different. However your kids had to speak English or French and get educated in the provincial curriculum. Your grandchildren are quite likely to drink and go out to young people's nightclubs.So, that rich ethnic diversity isn't as rich as you would think. You will be pushed into the mainstream matrix even while you still look different. You might not even notice how you are being pushed.Much Diversity But Not So Much of it EthnicI think some societies use ethnicity to distract people from some fairly serious types of not nice diversity. When you are fixated on those immigrants you may not notice that you have been plugged into that matrix, not necessarily where in that matrix you would like to be.The population of any country is diverse. Some serious efforts may be made to distract the people in that country from that reality. However, if you look at it, you see the diversity there.Martin LevineWhy are cultural differences controversial?November 26, 2017Hi Hideko.Not all cultural differences are. In another Answer I gave the example of Chinese-Canadians in Vancouver. Having Cantonese or Mandarin as your heritage language is a cultural difference but believing in hard work, self-reliance and the importance of education doesn’t clash with “real” Canadian values. The more important issue is that Chinese people look different from old stock, traditional Caucasian Canadians.I could give you an Ottawa example. A person of Arabic origin knowing how to operate a schwarma take-out place with high-quality schwarma at a reasonable price is a cultural difference but not much of problem. A lot of old stock Canadians of Ottawa don’t at all mind picking up take-outs there.The difficulty is your fear about what Arab-Canadian culture might represent. If you are an old stock Canadian but presume that schwarma equates with compulsory burqas for women and terrorism than you’ve got yourself a problem.MartinIs Romania a Slavic or Latin culture?November 26, 2017Having spent a couple of months in Bucharest and a few more months in Moscow I certainly wouldn't call Romania Slavic. However Romania really did cause me to ask what being “Latin” means.Romanian is very evidently a Latin language. It shares a large part of its word stock with Italian and French. I have heard some linguists suggest that the elaborate Romanian case endings are descended directly from Latin. However others suggest that this is really the influence of the nearby Slavic languages.However Romania isn't Roman Catholic, it's Orthodox. The Black Sea isn't the Mediterranean. At least from what I saw in Bucharest the Romanians don't have an especially Latin temperament. If anything they are rather stoic.It is hard to say what Romania might have been like without the Communist period. The Ceacescu regime kept the country terribly poor, more so than some other countries in the Eastern Bloc. The Romanians were forced to pretend they liked the Russians when they mostly feared them. Maybe that's part of why the Romanians are stoic.As a Canadian perhaps I could put in a word for the importance of climate. Mid-winter in Bucharest can be quite cold. However Romania is fairly far south and the summers are long and warm. Romania is a big wine producer. This isn't characteristically north-east European Russian and Polish - type Slavic.Romanian eating habits don't seem to be characteristically Slavic. Sarmale, mamaligeh and a glass of wine isn't Slavic type dining. Pastrami is if anything rather a Latin type of meat dish. On my weekends in Bucharest I noticed that people very much liked a stroll in a nice warm park and then an outdoor expresso. An Italian would understand.I wonder, if geopolitical circumstances hadn't intervened, whethér the Romanians wouldn't have become more attached to the Balkan and Greek world. However Yugoslavia remained outside of the Russian Block and Greece was in NATO.I recognize that not all Romanians are part of the typical Romanian culture. The country has substantial Hungarian, German-speaking and Romany minorities. Of course Romania used to be the home of a vibrant Jewish, Yiddish-speaking culture. The Jews of that culture were murdered and exiled and their property was stolen.Speaking of Ceacescu himself he seemed to have inherited a lot from Mussolini. Soviet communism was strongly opposed to personality cults. I can't quite think of a Slavic equivalent of the Mad Man's Palace in south Bucharest.Speaking as a Canadian, maybe being Latin is what you make of it. I have seen French Canadians struggle to be accepted as Latins although Montreal is as much of an icebox as Moscow and people in the Dominican Republic respond with bewilderment.The Communist era pushed the Romanians away from the much stronger relationship with Italy and Germany than they probably would have liked to have had. Now they can come much closer to the Latin world, as much as they like.Above all what I found in Bucharest were a lot of hospitable, friendly, rather gentle people who were living in a country with a very rough past. If it makes them happy to call a floor in a building an etage or an ant a fourni why not. If the Romanians really want to re-Latinize themselves I hope the Italians and the French, countries that the Romanians look up to with a lot of admiration, will give them a kind hand.Martin LevineAre Western cultures better than non-Western cultures? The west brought the most science and technology after all.November 26, 2017Hi Christian.Perhaps you should look at my Answer to Why were the Europeans so powerful?Your question may need a bit of clarification in it. Particularly:-When you say “cultures”, which ones do you mean? How are you differentiating one culture from another? Do you mean different languages?-What do you define as “Western? Do you mean European-origin? Would you then exclude Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and Singapore? These are highly prosperous, technologically and scientifically adept countries but the people are Asian.-What do you mean better? I would tend to say that better means be able to provide a high standard of living. What is your measure, scientific and technological progress, prosperity, political freedom, democracy and human rights, the fine arts?-What time frame do you want to talk about? Do you want to talk about the period from the start of the Industrial Revolution?Look Far BackWere Ancient Israel and Greece, Western? Some scholars argue that they are the basis of the Western World.However the concept of “Western cultures” hadn’t really come into existence at the time of my ancient ancestors and the classical Greeks.The Arab culture was the one that retained much of Ancient Greece’s cultural heritage after the decline of the Western Roman Empire. Islam was strongly effected by Ancient Israel. However, much, much later the Arab World took on the role of what some Arabs see as being the vanguard in opposition to western cultural imperialism.Countries that Don’t Fit The MouldWhat do we say about the People’s Republic of China and Russia?The People’s Republic of China is becoming scientifically and technologically quite proficient. However it isn’t yet a bigger Japan. Many Chinese are still very poor. The country has an authoritarian political system with little transparency or accountability. This allows corruption to be rife. With China, the scientific and technological test of cultural supremacy fails. Of course China is about one quarter of the world’s entire population.Is Russia western? Russia is a Caucasian-dominant country with a Christian tradition. It certainly has been a scientific and technological leader. However living standards haven’t yet reached those of Western Europe, the United Kingdom, the USA, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan or Singapore. Russia’s claim on democracy is quite tenuous. I have heard some scholars suggest that it is partially the Russian Orthodox Church that kept Russia from being a real Western country and culture.However, having spent a few months in Moscow, I have a lot of difficulty with refusing Russia membership in the Western World. What about Pushkin and Tchaikovsky? What about the very Europeanness of Moscow as a city? In talking with Russians my impression is that they grasp the importance of democracy, transparency, accountability and personal freedom. However they haven’t had much luck in achieving it.Western Cultures Behaving Very BadlyGermany is sometimes considered a prominent Western Culture. However during the first half of the twentieth century Germany was responsible for barbarism and murder on an unprecedented scale. They used advanced science and technology to do it. The modern, democratic progressive Germany was achieved only after millions of deaths and horrific destruction. The most extreme Nazis had to be physically killed. Russia, with its shaky western identity, took the forefront in killing many, many hard-line Nazis. The Allies might not have won the Second World War without them. If membership in Western culture was based on merit and courage the Russians ought to receive top prize and an apology for being disrespected.Consider Italy, in antiquity and in the Renaissance the founder of much of what many think are the foundations of Western culture. However by the early twentieth century Italy had turned into a brutal colonizer of Africa and a fascist state. Should we define the colonial occupation and exploitation of non-whites, using science and technology, as being basic to Western culture? How much “better” is this? Are not fascism and Nazism an intrinsic part of relatively recent Western culture?Modern Italy is one of the less economically viable, more corrupt parts of Europe. The European Union, dominated by Germany, has to help stabilize it. Generally the EU has to assist in subsidizing and stabilizing much of the European Mediterranean world. However, post World War II Italy has given us Fellini, Gucci, Dolce & Gabbana, Armani, Versace, Sophia Lauren, Marcello Mastroianni, Rimini-type lifestyles and excellent cuisine. Have they culturally paid northern Europe back for the help they have received? Isn’t Italy still a leader in the more positive, post World War II, sides of Western culture?Is the United Kingdom Really the Basis of Modern Western Culture?I come from a country that was prominent in the British Commonwealth. Despite being completely Ashkenazi I am probably biased.However, if one looks at the World since World War II, how much of Western Culture is really Anglo-American, English-speaking Canadian, Australian, New Zealand and Irish culture? These countries have put technology to the fore. They have been advocating for prototypically Western-type democracy, freedom and civil rights since the British Parliament began to become recognizably democratic.These countries are also the core ones for unplanned, relatively lightly-regulated “free enterprise”economies that drive the entire world along into the Star Trek future.At the same time, the Anglo-Sphere has been responsible for much of the Caucasian World’s colonial agression against non-whites. However after World War II, The United Kingdom liberated its colonies. Earlier, America, never a big external colonizer, withdrew from Cuba and the Philippines. It is the aboriginal people of the Anglo-Sphere that still need more liberation.So, when we are talking about contemporary Western culture, do we really mean the world centred on Buckingham Palace and the White House, with some fashion, high artistic, popular culture and cuisine throw-ins from Europe, all of this coming into existence with the massive military support of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics? Should we thank Afro-Americans for their massive contribution?Can I Be a Little Bit Ethnocentric?Albert Einstein, Neils Bohr, J. Robert Oppenhauser, Jonas Salk, Karl Marx, Leon Trotsky, Boris Pasternak, Carl Sagan, Milton Friedman, Edward Teller, Sigmund Freud, Bob Dylan, Franz Kafka, Leonard Cohen, William Shatner, Leonard Nimoy, Natalie Portman, Betty Friedan, Leonard Bernstein, Woody Allen, Jerry Lewis, Irving Berlin, Moses Mendelssohn, George Gershwin, Jerome Kern, Steven Spielberg, Larry Ellison, Sheldon Adelson, Mark Zuckerberg, George Soros, to name a few.Us Ashkenazim are defined by some as the antithesis of Western culture. Supposedly we want to replace it and the people in it. However, extract from modern Western culture that which has been created by the above and others and it wouldn’t be modern Western culture anymore.I use the term Ashkenazim rather than Jews advisedly. The hook-nosed Eastern European Jew is the one that scares the living delights out of those who advocate for pure, folkloric, traditional, absolutely Caucasian, Western culture. Hitler took the definition and ran with it. A lot of these folks wouldn’t know who a Sephardi was.So Christian, I Think We’ve Narrowed this Down a BitThe modern, Western-European but especially Anglo-American Western cultural world has lot of good things going for it. However defining that superiority with reference to science and technology is not anywhere as certain as it used to be.The standard reply from the non-Caucasian world is that Western culture wrecked them. The “West” stole, their resources, enslaved them, murdered them, drew international borders where they shouldn’t have been and treated them as pawns in the Cold War. Insisting that they call Western culture superior is going to be a hard sell.What are we supposed to say about the non-Caucasian high-tech world? Should we forget about race and include the prosperous, reasonably democratic ones in the Western world?I am troubled by the popular Canadian saying, “What goes around comes around”. Also there is another one popular one here, “Be careful what you wish for because you might get it.”.Maybe the modern Western cultural world needs to do more to lose the nasty baggage of what happened up to the end of World War II and work more on that Star Trek future for everybody. Some of the Western cultural legacy still badly needs to be refined out. Once we do that maybe we won’t even need to talk about what is “better”.Martin Levine"
1238,"what you can do is :Follow you College Syllabus by that what i mean is, you find what to do in your syllabus, follow it, as it will also help you to score in exams and helps you understand the concept properly as same thing is going in class and at your home.Just don’t depend on teachers, try to dig out everything by your own, ask your doubts on QA forms there are many people out there how are always ready to help.As you feel most of your time in class get wasted, make sure you enjoy that time(may be just passing comments on person next to you just make sure that your teacher won’t notice, or may be just looking at your crush and try to know her/him), as you just can’t go home and again back to study after having a bad day.Instead of spending time on social network, make use of it in writing code(you can solve your mathematics problem, as it will help you to pass mathematics exam which is worst nightmare you any engineer and also makes you concept clear as you need maths while writing algorithms or studying about them.Make use of your semester breaks, as now you have whole day to use it in any way.When you feel you are good enough with coding concept, pick a project from GitHub, and make contribute to it.Last but no the least take you practical lab problems seriously, work on them by yourself, instead of just copy paste.What i feel is college Syllabus design is pretty good, if you follow it, you definitely can make something big out of it."
1239,"I verbally fought with a Ticket collector for a BSF soldier!Long story short!This happened a couple of months back.I was traveling from New Delhi to Ahmedabad.The Ticket collector encountered a BSF guy near my seat who had soft copy of window ticket.The TC got furious and started demanding him 2200 bucks (Rajdhani fare) on the basis of invalid ticket.The guy was very simple and sober in his late twenties. He didn’t seem to know a lot of rules and kept pleading.An uncle tried to convince the TC but he was rigid.The guy said he worked in BSF and it’s emergency for his family so he got the ticket through someone from his village.The TC said, “Mere liye kaam kar rhe, ya khud k liye?”(Are you working for me? Or for your own sake?)I know it was wrong on the guy’s part, but something didn’t seem right to me since there were more than 90 vacant seats in the train.The TC asked the guy to get down ASAP.Ten minutes later the TC called the guy outside the door and was talking about money.I went to use the restroom and overheard the conversation. The TC was demanding money from him while the guy was constantly pleading.I went to the TC and politely requested him to let it go. The TC started behaving rudely to me and started to ask what I am doing.He spoke all the silly and useless things to me.I couldn’t bear his inhumane thinking and shouted back, and more people gathered around the restroom area trying to shut me up.The TC realized he was losing and said those golden words, “Itna hi humanity dikhana hai to iski ticket k liye half tum pay karo, half mai karta hu”(If your are so concerned, let’s pay half each for his his ticket)I agreed. He was stupefied for a while.He got stuck in his own web.He denied it with some other silly conversation and I came back to my place thinking I can’t fight back more!I gave him a mouthful.The guy came back to his seat after 5 minutes and told us the TC took 200 bucks from him.I smiled. The TC was telling me about the rules and he himself took the bribe and lost his humanity and Job ethics both.After an hour he comes to me and starts to lecture me, “Aap ka job hoga to karna sabke against, dekhenge hum. Naam yaad hai muje aapka”(If you are in government job, do everything against the system, will see. I vividly remember your name)And he left.I was blushing. It was a small victory for me.Everyone stared at me and felt no shame. They could have supported the guy together.Funny Fact 1: While returning from Delhi a few days back, I saw the same TC in the adjacent coach and guess what? He couldn’t recognize me. I made him remember just saying three words, “Smita Mishra, PhD, BSF guy”.And he remembered!I laughed.P.S: I have respect for every soldier in the world. They might be in this job to look after their family, yet it’s commendable. We know how much sacrifices they make and we should do everything possible to make them feel that we care for them too!!-Smita"
1240,"DEMOCRACY basically means OF THE PEOPLE, FOR THE PEOPLE, BY THE PEOPLE , But now today they have made it OFF THE PEOPLE, FAR THE PEOPLE, BUY THE PEOPLE, but still democracy is the best form of government, democracy does not promise you to take you to take you to the heaven but it protects you from going to the hell, “ The cure for the evils of democracy is more democracy.” Despite of it’s all the odds and flaws we have so many good advantages of democracy which are as follows:-1. People as Sovereign--Government of the people, by the people, and for the people; not for the wealthy (plutocracy), for the powerful few (oligarchy), for a single hereditary ruler (monarchy) or a single leader or dictator (autocracy), or for a hereditary nobility or privileged class (aristocracy). --People’s sovereignty is expressed directly (plebiscitary democracy) or through representatives (republican democracy).-- Question to ponder: Who are considered “people” for enfranchisement?2. It protects the interest of citizens:- The citizens in a democratic country are given the right to vote on political, social and economical issues, particularly the representatives they want to be in charge of making major decisions, such as the Prime Minister. This can greatly protect the people from anything they would disagree to occur. Remember ballot is more powerful than bullet.3. It prevents monopoly of authority:- Due to the fact that the government is bound by an election term where parties compete to regain authority, democracy prevents monopoly of the ruling authority. And, the elected ruling party would make sure their policies will work for the people, as they will not be able to remain in power after their term with bad records—they will not be re-elected.Democracy is the theory that the common people know what they want and deserve to get it good and hard.HL Mencken (1880 - 1956)4. It promotes equality:- Generally, democracy is based on the rule of equality, which means that all people are equal as far as the law is concerned. Every person has the right to experience and enjoy equal political, social and economic rights, and the state is not allowed to discriminate him on the standard of sex, class, religion and property.Democracy arose from men's thinking that if they are equal in any respect, they are equal absolutely.Aristotle (384 BC-322 BC) Greek philosopher.5. It makes for a responsible and stable administration:- When there are elected and fixed representatives, a more responsible government is formed. Thus, democracy can be efficient, firm and stable. Its administration is ruled and conducted with a sense of dedication, and people under this system discuss matters and problems thoroughly to come up with sensible decisions. Democracy means government by discussion,6. It promotes change:- This political system can promote changes in the government without having to resort to any form of violence. It tries to make citizens feel great and even provides them with a good sense of participation and involvement.7. Majority Rule--Size of majority: majority or more than majority (i.e, “super-majority”), --Type of majority: by state, by population, etc.--Elections open and verifiable for determining majority decision.8. Minority Rights--Pluralism and multi-party access to all levels of decision-making. --Realistic choices and alternatives must be available.--Free exchange of ideas, information, and opinion.--Press not dictated by government or big-business corporations.9. Separation of Powers--Powers of government internally separated into branches, for example, executive, legislative, and judicial.--Powers within branches of government separated between representatives and the people’s participation (judicial: judge and jury, legislative: legislature and initiative).--Powers separated from government, for example, separation of church and state, right of privacy from government intrusion, right to assembly, etc.10. DEMOCRACY INTRODUCES SELF-GOVERNMENT AT THE GRASS ROOT LEVEL:- The essence of democracy is self-government. Democracy distributes administrative power to lower levels up to the very grass root level of villages. Within a country, smaller administrative boundaries are drawn which are further divided among different blocks, each having its own self-government system. Though the smaller governments are subordinate to the national government, they provide enough exposure, administrative power and participation opportunity to people, increasing efficiency and in turn making the government more accountable. Panchayati Raj Institutions is good example of this.Democracy is a form of government in which all eligible people have an equal say in the decisions that affect their lives11. IT PROVIDES SPACE FOR FAIR AND HEALTHY COMPETITION:- Democracy is built on the very pillar of fairness which gives it clear advantage over alternative forms of government. In democracy, every citizen has a fair chance to come to power. Every individual has one vote and every vote has equal value. The say of a slum dweller in deciding the political future of the country is the same as that of a millionaire industrialist. Free and fair elections are held from time to time under the supervision of an independent body. A true democracy is a platform of healthy competition, not subjected to muscle might or power play.As I would not be a slave, so I would not be a master. This expresses my idea of democracy.Abraham Lincoln12. THE OPTION FOR JUSTIFIED PROTEST IS OPEN TO ALL:- This is one of the biggest marked differences between democracy and other forms of governments. Authoritative regimes do not allow the masses to protest against the decisions made by those in power. The people have to quietly bear the burden of the exploitative rules of the powerful. If a revolutionary spark is noticed, it is brutally suppressed. However, in democracy, people have the right to protest and express their views against the government decisions publicly, as far as the law and order is maintained. A democratic government can be pressurized by organizing people and putting forward protests and any unjustified or cruel repression is legally dealt with.13. IT CAN DEAL WITH CONFLICTS IN THE MOST PEACEFUL MANNER:- All large societies witness differences of interests as well as opinions among the different sections of people comprising them. E.g. if we consider India, we may easily find sharp differences between people belonging to different regions/ castes/ religions or speaking different languages. The conflicting preferences of people may often lead to clashes which are best solved in a democratic setup. No one emerges as a permanent winner or loser and people learn to live peacefully with each other. In administrative structures other than democracy, it will become a matter of power play where the more powerful group shall dictate its terms to the less powerful one, leading to resentment and unhappiness.14. IT PROVIDES SCOPE TO CORRECT ONE’S MISTAKE:- Though in a democracy, people take their own decisions by electing their own representatives, there is no guarantee that decisions taken by the general public at the time of elections prove to be right for the years to come. Sometimes, people may later realize that they made a wrong choice. The best part of democracy is that such mistakes cannot stay hidden for long and there is room for correction. When the representatives we elect turn out to be corrupt or insensitive towards public sentiments, we can always vote for better alternatives in the next general elections. If the rulers do not change their decisions, we can change them. This is not possible in any other form of government.15. THE REAL POWER IS VESTED IN THE HANDS OF THE MASSES:- Unlike a dictatorship/authoritarian regime where all power is concentrated in the hands of the arbitrary ruler, democracy is one form of government that truly empowers the masses. This is because, not someone else, but the masses govern themselves. While many say, democracy provides the right to vote, I say it provides millions of citizens the POWER TO VOTE. This is why the why the word “people” becomes so important in Abraham Lincoln’s famous description of democracy as a government “by the PEOPLE, of the PEOPLE and for the PEOPLE”. Often, people who enjoy it give little thought to it, but the people who do not have any say in how they wish to be governed realize its real worth.In democracy it's your vote that counts; In feudalism it's your count that votes.Mogens Jallberg16. DEMOCRACY ENHANCES DIGNITY OF CITIZENS:- The political scene of a country largely determines the quality of social life of its citizens. This is where democracy rushes quite ahead of alternative forms of government. The strongest argument in favor of democracy does not relate to what democracy does to the government but to what democracy does to its citizens. Even if democracy leads to instability, even if it may not bring better decisions and even if it does not stay accountable to people, it still remains the best because it enhances the dignity of citizens. With democracy, come rights and freedoms, equality and justice. Each individual, rich or poor has the same political status. There are no restrictions on thoughts, beliefs, religious practices and expression. Democracy is where every individual walks dignified and fearless with the head held high.In a democracy the poor will have more power than the rich, because there are more of them, and the will of the majority is supreme.Aristotle"
1241,"“I can't do this anymore. I think I am done.”I called my father at 12:30 A.M, crying, from my hostel and told him. I was at a really bad place in life. It just felt nothing was going my way and everyone who mattered were drifting away. No, I wasn't suicidal. No I wasn't exactly depressed. I was just tired. Tired of everything.He asked me what was wrong. I couldn't tell him. How could I? It wasn’t about one thing, it was a lot of little things.I cried all night. My best friend was with me the entire time. She tried consoling me. It didn't help. Nothing did. I didn't realize when I fell asleep.Next day, exactly at 8:30 A.M, someone knocked on the door. I was too exhausted to get up. My friend opened the door.There she was, my mother. My father was waiting in the reception.My parents had actually managed to book a ticket and fly all the way to Bangalore from Kolkata and then come to my hostel within a span of 8.5 hours, all because I cried a little over the phone.Now, I belong to a simple middle class family. I know what last minute flight tickets cost. It must have costed them months and months of saving. Yet, they were there. Right in front of me. Only for me.Best gift ever!It made me realize, no matter how messed up my life is, one part of my life can never ever fall apart, my parents.They stayed with me for three days to make sure I am okay. They didn't have to, for I felt better the instant I saw them, but I am glad they did."
1242,"Firstly to learn anything from anyone or anything, you should know that you are not the best in your league.That's the major problem these days. People think they are better than anyone else in their league and thus fail to learn and achieveWhen you overcome that ego of yours that's when the magic startsThat's when we recognize the true teachers in our life.I am an 18 year old student. So far I have realized that there are three teachers in our life from whom we can learn all the aspects of lifeLet's start with the first oneA) NATURE IS THE WORLD'S BEST TEACHERS.Nature is the best teacher there can be. No wonder our ancestors used to look upto nature for knowledge. But what is the we can learn from nature these daysLet's first consider why the sun, the moon and some trees are considered Divine according to Hindu mythologySun - The giver of light, energy, seasons … the list is endless. But what we could learn most from it is how we should be when we are in a position of power. Many a times the sun is covered by the clouds … yet, what does it do? It does not wrestle with the clouds to show who is greater; it does not take away the cloud’s moment of glory, that the cloud could overshadow somebody as great as the sun. Instead, the sun gives the cloud a halo, its silver lining, making the cloud look more beautiful. Humans, especially leaders need to learn this from the sun. When one is great, is in a position of power, it is not necessary to take away the limelight from others all the time… Appreciating others not only add to that person’s glory, it also makes others look forward to seeing YOU again.MOON: The bestower of calm, cooling sensations to the aggrieved or restless mind. The moon changes its shape every day, it is called fickle … but have you ever visualized the moon with a sad expression? No, never. In any shape, it always seems that the moon is smiling. Whether it is a wide crescent smile or an open-toothed half-moon smile or a peaceful full moon smile … it’s always happy and filled with love. It doesn’t matter that it is faced with a change every single day. It still inspires hope and love.RAIN: We love the rains; we look forward to a break from the heat. It bestows life into the parched earth. It helps the crops grow. But beautiful rains create messy, dirty roads. Much like Life – this beautiful life of ours creates messy, ugly situations sometimes. These situations make us understand life; they make us realize the value of everything that we have. They help US grow. Dirty roads don’t make the rains any less lovely; bad situations shouldn’t make us value and love life any lesser.TREES: Nature’s ardent helper, giver of oxygen, provider of shade to the tired traveler, health giver, shelter provider to the birds and other creatures. The tree never knowingly harms anybody. Instead, it feeds the hands that hurt it, whether one pelts it with stones for the fruit or cuts it for the wood. The first knowledge of virtues like patience, forgiveness, generosity must have come by observing the trees.RIVER: The river is one of the most important eco-system in the world. It is the giver of life to the fields, animals, trees and humans alike. It finds its way through the mountains & hills, through rocks and stones. It is playful in some places, tumbles down with a roar or is very peaceful sometimes. It finds its own sweet music, makes its own path and there is nothing that can stop it, no, not even the biggest boulder. And best of all, it accepts its merger into the big, wide sea. Can human life and its final journey be any different?SEA: There is nobody on earth who can claim to know how many treasures the seas contain in their depths. Perpetually attracted by the moon, they heave and ebb in response to its closeness. Look into our lives … we can never measure the depth of human emotions, can we? Every emotion is a treasure which does not have to be displayed to one and all. Being peaceful and humble despite our richness, remaining within our limits almost always should be the most important lessons that we can learn from the sea. Never forget that there is always another wave even if the earlier one returns … there is always more to life, irrespective of the setbacks.FIELDS: Barren sometimes and sometimes slushy, a verdant green sometimes and brown otherwise, the fields reflect the seasons so beautifully. They are willing to bear the pain of ploughing and weeding, to give the farmer their best crops. Even when the crops are cut and they are neglected, they sprout grass to feed the cows. To bring out from the depths to give and then give some more selflessly, is what we can learn from the fields. Remember that the lush fields also lay bare from time to time. That is the time that the field replenishes its reserves. In business when we face a downturn, that is the time to start collecting our energies and build up our reserves so that when the time is right, we are able to give our best.Let's talk about the second one i.e mistakes here,B) MISTAKES do not necessarily has to be the one which is visible or what other tells you someone tells you or what you make in exam. They are the smaller version of it. The bigger part involves the abstract one. That is when you realize that you are doing something so wrong and that's the major cause of your failure or there is something with your mindset. Trust me it could be anything. It's not as easy as it sounds to recognize what your mistakes arePeople are categorized into three categories based on mistakes1) Dumb - It's okay to make mistakes but to make that same mistake twice is what makes you dumb. you gotta recognize your mistake. TOUGH PART2) Smart - Once you have recognized your mistake you rectify it and you learn from it. That's what makes you smarter than the other averagesand the third and final category is3) Smartest - They are the real gems. They observe people and recognize their mistakes (TOUGHEST PART) and learn from them and that's what makes them the bestand the very obvious one that is our teacher our School/College's teacher.What we should learn from them is that there is something the subject which is interesting that they almost devoted their life to that subject and voilaAlso, always respect your teachers As the famous saint KABIR once said,Guru govind dohu khade, kake lagu paanyeBalihari guru aapne govind diyo batayeगुरु गोविन्द दोहु खड़े, काके लांगू पाँय..बलिहारी गुरु आपने, गोविन्द दियो बताये.Meaning: I bestow GURU (teacher) than to GOD…. For all his thanks giving.P.S. Pardon me if I missed any but actually its all up to an individual. Different people prefer different teachers. Some prefer strict some goes for lineant teachers. Strict teachers would be the ones that push you, the one that make you cross the line which you at first considered as your limits. So strict teacher would be the one that are mentioned below like Pain, experience and something tragicThank You"
1243,"Why didn't Huma Abedin give the FBI immediate permission to examine the 650,000 Email?According to the FBI, she is cooperating. Since the laptop is his but she occasionally used it, the FBI would not want to jeopardize any potential case without a proper search warrant outside the original warrant to investigate Weiner’s emails only. Abedin did not have the right to give permission.It would make no sense for Weiner to give up his right to self-incrimination by giving the FBI carte blanche so the FBI had to expand the scope of the search warrant.I am sure Abedin’s lawyer told her to let the FBI get a search warrant to examine the entire laptop contents.Restoring transparency and fairness to the FBI investigation of Abedin/Clinton emails"
1244,"If they don't already know, there's a good reason for that.  If your friends and family were close to you, they'd have been the first people you told, but they'd have been with you every step of the way. Bad family and bad friends can and will pretend to care for money and using you.As for your ex, that ship has sailed. It's over. If they came back it wouldn't be for you, but for the money. Which is a very sad ending. You deserve better, someone who chooses you even if you were poor. Who loves you.If I ever got to the point where I was a millionaire (haha),  where I wasn't struggling daily to even pay my bills and keep the power on, I'd  only tell the people I knew were there for me when I was struggling.  No one else.Right now, that number I can count on one hand. Rather than have people use me, I'd help people who really need it. I have always dreamed of being a millionaire so i could travel the world and see how other cultures live. I'd love even the chance to visit another country just once. So i could for once not worry about surviving. To afford to go to a good school. And then... So i could help the elderly and homeless animals. Really help those who need help. Who deserve better. Not helping friends who are getting by just fine who want a boat or a loan they won't pay back. An ex who sees a chance to have everything they ever wanted instead of love.It's your money, and it's your life. So choose wisely who you let in. And help those you feel deserve it.

The eldest of us was going to A P Mission School and number 2 and i were too young to go to school!With all the punishments during my school days, especially 1956–57, i had to bear, sit after school to write “SPEECH IS SILVER AND SILENCE IS GOLDEN”, 700 times on one occasion, i still have very pleasant memories of my School.Back in those days there were SJA, Convent of Jesus and Mary for girls, St Thomas School (co-ed) with English medium. Doon School was not for commoners like us."

1247,"Many people address this question as if it were a matter of opinion. Well, it is not. Most questions like this can be addressed in a pretty scientific way by analyzing the data. And, if you do that, the answer is pretty clear: the best football player of all time is Lionel Messi.If you don't believe my words, take a look at the very detailed analysis that FiveThirtyEight did during the last World Cup: Lionel Messi Is ImpossibleLionel Messi outperforms everyone, and in particular Cristiano Ronaldo, who appears mostly as second in many statistics in the following aspects:Overall Scoring ProductionShooting EfficiencyGoal percentage from any given distanceUnassisted Goal EfficiencyOne-on-one success rateAssists per gameNumber of long balls played per gameThrough-ball passesPasses by forwardsValue added per offensive actionGoals plus assists per balls playedPlays defended per opponent possessionGiven his current performance in Barcelona this year, I am pretty sure the stats are even higher now.So, no, Messi being the best is not an opinion, it is a fact proven by hard data.Messi in the 2014 World CupSome people will argue that Messis has had a poor performance with the Argentinian national team and in particular in the 2014 World Cup. I also personally agree that Messi did not play his best in the World Cup. Still, he came out of the group stages as being rated number 1 by many (see World Cup 2014 in statistics: the 10 players who excelled in the group stage for example).  So even in this relatively negative part of his playing, he stands out as one of the bestMessi vs. Maradona or PeleOther people argue that either Maradona or Pele were better players than Messi. As for the comparison to Pele, the answer is that we don't know because there is not enough data to make a fair comparison. But, we do know for sure he is better than Maradona (see Messi Is Better Than Maradona, But Maybe Not Pele).Again, Messi outperforms Maradona in most dimensions. Some people will argue that Maradona's stats are worse because he played in worse teams (like Naples). That is nonsense. It is similar to saying that his stats were worse because he took more drugs. Maradona made stupid decisions in his life and professional career that ended up affecting his results. That is actually part of his not being the best.And, if data is not enough for you... just take a look at the following video:"
1248,"Everyone’s answer will be different but for me, the scariest movie I’ve ever seen isInsidious (2010)The story centers on a couple whose son inexplicably enters a comatose state and becomes a vessel for ghosts in an astral dimension who want to inhabit his body.This scene in particular makes me look around my room whenever I wake up during the night. There are many scary scenes in this movie that will give you the chills but this one in particular is very frightening.Also, there’s this:James Wan made this movie and he also made the Conjuring movies which are also scary but this is the first horror movie I’ve ever seen. I saw it when I was 9 or 10 so it was especially scary at the time. If you easily get scared of old music or the dark I’d watch this movie with caution if you haven’t already.Here’s the trailer if you wanna watch it:Honorable mentions:“Signs” (2002)Everything that farmer Graham Hess (Mel Gibson) assumed about the world is changed when he discovers a message - an intricate pattern of circles and lines - carved into his crops. As he investigates the unfolding mystery, what he finds will forever alter the lives of his brother (Joaquin Phoenix) and children (Rory Culkin), (Abigail Breslin). A unique story that explores the mysterious real-life phenomena of crop signs and the effects they have on one man and his family.“Sinister” (2012)True-crime writer Ellison Oswald (Ethan Hawke) is in a slump; he hasn't had a best seller in more than 10 years and is becoming increasingly desperate for a hit. So, when he discovers the existence of a snuff film showing the deaths of a family, he vows to solve the mystery. He moves his own family into the victims' home and gets to work. However, when old film footage and other clues hint at the presence of a supernatural force, Ellison learns that living in the house may be fatal.“The Conjuring” (2013) & “The Conjuring 2” (2016)In 1970, paranormal investigators and demonologists Lorraine (Vera Farmiga) and Ed (Patrick Wilson) Warren are summoned to the home of Carolyn (Lili Taylor) and Roger (Ron Livingston) Perron. The Perrons and their five daughters have recently moved into a secluded farmhouse, where a supernatural presence has made itself known. Though the manifestations are relatively benign at first, events soon escalate in horrifying fashion, especially after the Warrens discover the house's macabre history.“Annabelle: Creation” (2017)Former toy maker Sam Mullins and his wife, Esther, are happy to welcome a nun and six orphaned girls into their California farmhouse. Years earlier, the couple's 7-year-old daughter Annabelle died in a tragic car accident.

1249,"Thanks for the A2A and great question!I'm going to expand my answer a bit to what happens if the Presidential candidate dies before Election Day, after election day but before the Electoral College vote, and before inauguration.The answer to what happens if the candidate dies before Election Day is that it is different depending on party. Nothing of the sort has happened before, but there are procedures (very murky, but still existent) in both the Democratic and Republican parties to replace the candidate. The important point here is that the vice president nominee does not automatically take over the ticket.The Republicans have it crystal clear on this one, actually. If the presidential candidate dies, then the Republican National Committee (RNC) must select the candidate through A new national convention orA vote by RNC state representativesThe RNC gets the choice on which one it is.The Democrats do address the question, saying that the Democratic National Committee (DNC) gets to choose the candidate to replace the deceased candidate. No additional details are provided, so they get free rein.Unfortunately, if the presidential candidate dies on the day of the election, all of this would probably no longer function. There is simply not enough time to choose a candidate, reprint all the ballots, etc. Unfortunately, while Congress can push back Election Day, it is my belief that many states have laws that put voting on November 1st. This would severely hinder any such efforts, throwing the election into chaos. So until we change this, no one really knows what will happen. We can only hope that the politicians get their bearings quickly enough to respond to such a situation if it ever occurs.I believe that addresses the question asked for the two major parties.What about the other two scenarios? If a presidential candidate dies before the Electoral College votes, then the delegates to the Electoral College become unbound/still obligated to vote for the deceased candidate/another candidate due to a variety of interesting state rules regulating this event.If the president-elect dies before inauguration, the vice president-elect is inaugurated by the 20th Amendment.Hope this helps!

1250,"Its totally a myth.Virtually all modern smart phones use lithium-ion batteries. These batteries are designed with the understanding that you’re going to be using your phone on the go. Sometimes you’ll need to unplug it before you’re finished charging; sometimes you’ll plug in the phone for a quick top-off, and, of course, you'll often leave it plugged in overnight. These batteries are designed for all of that.The truth is, the major threat to your battery life is time. All rechargeable batteries have a limited number of ""charge cycles”. A charge cycle is basically going from near-empty to completely full. Even though this number is very large, eventually your phone’s battery will reach a point where its charging capacity starts getting smaller. Rechargeable batteries just don’t last forever.Now, back to the original question, all smart phones these days are programmed to stop charging the battery once the battery is fully charged, and from that point the phone runs directly from the charger's electricity. So, there's no risk your battery being overcharged or it affecting the life of the battery. In fact when the battery is fully charged, the battery isn't in use at all, which would extend its lifespan.Another thing that is bad for batteries is heat. Using your cellphone in a hot environment can run down the battery really fast. And of course your phone can heat up as well from intensive use. Try to avoid that, or at least not run apps that heat up your phone for too long. A cool phone is a happy phone.Now, it’s important to keep in mind that i'm talking about phones with lithium-ion batteries here(not to worry almost all smart phones use them). But many other devices do not, so care for them may be different."
1251,"Unfortunately most GPS devices do not transmit anything TO the satellite.  They simply retrieve the timing pulses from several satellites and through some mathematics triangulate their position.If it's a GPS *tracking* device, then it will usually have some kind of cellular or wireless connection to the internet where it can report its position to a central database.  But without that, the device cannot report its location.So you will probably need some kind of smartphone or tracking device with these capabilities if you want to track the location of company vehicles etc."

1253,"Yes, absolutely! And here's why -India's past as well as present are replete with examples where non-Indians have migrated to India and assimilated in the local culture. People have migrated from countries/regions like Persia, Afghanistan, Central Asia, Middle East, Saudi Arabia, Armenia, Israel, Turkey, Macedonia, Greece, Hungary, Poland, Italy, Portugal, France, Switzerland, UK, US, Africa, China, New Zealand and settled all over India - Bengal, Punjab, Tamil Nadu, Pondicherry, Goa, Karnataka, Himachal Pradesh, Delhi, Maharashtra, Karnataka, Haryana, Gujarat, Kerala, Uttar Pradesh, Bihar.Non-Indians came to India in the form of -1. Conquerors - Not the typical immigrants that the OP may have had in mind but nevertheless there were waves of such migrations. They settled in India or maybe their generals and soldiers stayed, inter-married with locals. Their language, religion, cuisine, art got intermingled with what was prevalent at the time in India.Greeks post Alexander's conquest - The last 2 centuries BC saw several kings of Greek heritage dominate Northwestern part of Indian subcontinent. Menander (Milinda) is a popular one from the list. See Indo-Greek KingdomFrom Iranian plateau/Central Asia - Kushan dynasty with Kanishka as the prominent king who was based in modern day Peshawar and had links as far as Mathura and Saketa (Allahabad) had origins in Iranian plateau.Islamic conquest - Arabs/Afghans/Persians/Central Asians -  Muhammad bin Qasim came from what is now Saudi Arabia and conquered Sindh, Ghori, Ghazni who came from Afghanistan. Babur came from what is now Uzbekistan and created the Mughal Dynasty. Other dynasties like Sayyeds, Lodhis, Khaljis have origins in Afghanistan and Central Asia. 2. Artists, Architects, Poets, Mercenaries, Generals - There are several accounts of Artists from Europe (especially Portrait Artists) who came to India during Mughal empire and spent several years or settled. The glorious monuments like Taj Mahal required many an architects and designers and calligraphers from Persia to come to India. Maharaja Ranjit Singh had several French and Italian Generals in his army who kept his army modern and up to date.3. Courtesans - Almost invisible within the archival record, some migrant women such as the Armenian Bibi Juliana and the Portuguese Juliana Dias da Costa found a home in royal Mughal harems. Here's a fascinating story of Angelina Yeoward who was born in 1873 to an Armenian Jew, William Robert Yeoward and Victoria Hemmings in Azamgarh (Uttar Pradesh). She went on to become ‘Gauhar Jaan’ and became one of the most popular performers in India. This link is worth checking out - The Armenian Tawaif4. Healers - Several Healers migrated from Portugal and Italy and adapted their medical practice in accordance with local traditions.5. Travelers, Explorers, Adventurers, Spies, Missionaries, Traders - India's West coast had links with traders of Arabian Sea for centuries before Europeans arrived. That is how Christianity and Islam had set foot without any conquest. Several decades before East India Company arrived in India, there were missionaries and adventurers who came to India. Some came from the overland route from Syria-Iran while others came via seas. In the late 1700s and 1800s, one in three British officers/soldiers had an Indian wife due to a lack of British women in India at the time. Popular book titled 'The White Mughals' by William Dalrymple documents the inter-ethnic liaisons between British officers and Indian women. He also talks about how they adopted Indian ways - dressing, religion. He unearths such colourful figures as 'Hindoo Stuart', who travelled with his own team of Brahmins to maintain his temple of idols, and who spent many years trying to persuade the memsahibs of Calcutta to adopt the sari; and Sir David Ochterlony in Delhi, who took all thirteen of..."
1254,"Marrying my best friend and then Divorcing her.Mistake 1She was the most beautiful girl in the college and we had an instant connection. The journey from bench-mates to friend to best-friend just took 3 months. And then we were inseparable. She helped me with my love life and I helped her with hers. We were practically soul-mates.After college, we remained in touch and although we were separated by thousands of miles yet we were the same. We met and had fun on 11th of every month, no matter whether it was a holiday or a weekday or a meeting or a project. We even had a fair share of fights. This friendship was something that kept me going. She kept me going. I was an extreme case of introvert but she just made my life.Mistake 2Gradually, I fell for her- the biggest mistake of my life. On one such 11th while watching a movie, I had a moment and I placed my lips on hers. She responded positively. We made out that night. That was the turning point in my life. Although nothing changed between us, we decided to let it be a one-time thing and not let it affect our friendship. She loved me but unlike me, she wasn’t in love with me.This was not a one-time thing. It repeated on the next 11th and then the next 11th and then it was a routine for us. But neither could I confess my love nor could I make her fall in love with me.Mistake 3Her parents were quite orthodox and started pressurizing her for marriage. Although she made it clear that she wanted to focus on her career but they were unmoved. They wanted to marry her by November 2017 by hook or by crook. She broke down in front of me and said that she would run away somewhere. To help her, I asked her to introduce me to her parents as her boyfriend and ask for a couple of years. She reluctantly agreed to the same.I had to meet her parents, they really liked me. But they wanted us to get married by November. They gave her an option to either marry me by November or marry someone of their choice. But the marriage would not be delayed.Mistake 4Seeing no other option, I asked her to marry me but she wasn’t ready. I told her to marry me for the sake of her parents and then we’ll get a mutual divorce and she can do whatever she wants. Although this was really a harsh decision for me coz my family would face the repercussions but still, I went on with it coz I loved her. Reluctantly, she also agreed. We were married in October 2017.I had a small hope that she might have a change of mind and starts loving me. The next 5 months were a bliss. They were truly amazing. I had the best time of my life with my love. But everything has an end and so did the amazing times. One day, in the fifth month of our marriage, she brought the topic of divorce. I was taken aback but composed myself and next day consulted a lawyer.Mistake 5I didn’t try to stop her or convince her. Finally, in July 2018, we completed our divorce formalities. She moved out the following month. Her parents are still unaware of the same. My parents stood by me like a rock. I am now depressed. We didn’t celebrate our 11th this month. We don’t talk as much as we used to. I changed my job, my city but nothing helped. I failed myself.She was the love of my life, my pillar of strength and now both are gone. How I wish I could tell her how much I love her but then let’s face it that she was never meant for me!"

1256,"Well, this didn't happen to me, but to my friend’s friend. Hold your breath ladies and gentlemen!!For privacy puroses, let's assume her name Alex. She used to work untill late in the evenings. On the way back home, everyday she needed to go through a local park, as that was the shortest way. On the usual evenings, there's always few old people sitting on bench and gossiping. So she never had any fear of walking alone in the dark through the park.Though one day, she worked quite later than usual. On the way back home, she felt a little hesitation to go through the park, as it was darker than usual plus the fact that she knew there wouldn't be anyone sitting on the bench at this time. But anyhow, she chose to go through the park, as that was the shortest way. As soon as she entered the park, she heard some noise from her back. She turned her head, there was a man who was quickly running towards her. Oh damn! she started walking fast. She looked back again to see him, but to her surprise, the man stopped chasing him. After few seconds, Alex looked back again to see him. What the heck!! he was walking so fast towards Alex again. She started praying so hard and started running. But to her surprise again, the man stopped chasing her and started walking in opposite direction. This happened four times, the last time he was so close to Alex, that it was mere 4–5 feet distance and she could clearly see his face. Luckily, she was out of the park by then and felt so much relief.No, that wasn't the horror part. Few days later, she saw the same person in the news arrested for a rape and following murder. Alex was shocked to see the same man for those charges. He could've hurt Alex too that day, but why he didn't do anything that day when he could. Was he just playing around or scarring her like this?Alex went to police station to report that incident and to see him. Finally, she was able to speak to him and ask him that why he didn't hurt her that day if this was all he was planning that day too.The man’s answer shocked Alex.He said because there were so many people with you.“What?? No, I was alone.” Alex said.“You were alone before, but as soon as I was approaching you, few people came and asked me to leave you. I went back, but then I saw you were walking alone. I started chasing you again, then more people came and told me to leave. I was surprised how come so many people come at once and that too this late at night. The last time I tried to come close to you, their shouts were so loud that I couldn't bear. They also told me that they would kill me if I don't leave you alone. So, I just ran away from there.”That was even more shivering than what happened to Alex that day. But good to know, there aren't always bad ghosts, there are good ghosts too..may be angels..who knows!!"
1257,"No.  Never.  Eight years ago, my husband lost his job during the recession, and during that year he was unemployed we used our savings, so five years ago, when my husband lost his job again, we didn´t have a safe net.  I was a housewife, and I worked from home, in eventual gigs, and did not make much money.  He was anxious and depressed due to our economic problems, and he ended up in the hospital.My husband was in the hospital, and I needed to buy food and pay the electrical bill and didn't have any money, so I took some jewellery, including my wedding ring, and took them to a pawn shop.  I expected to pay for them and recover my things, but that never happened and I lost them.  Later that same year, my purse was stolen, so I told my husband that my wedding ring was there along with other things.I have tried to be a good wife, honest and trust-worthy, and this is my deepest secret, but I won't tell him this because he would feel sad for it, and at the end it is only things that can be replaced with money. Updated on March 31th, 2016.Thanks for your nice words everyone, really appreciated, but I don't feel like I did a big deal.  Instead, I felt, and I still feel now, that I was silly, I got ripped off, I got scammed... By the time this happened, it was like the perfect storm, and I could not ask for help from anybody.  I feel ashamed that I lost it like THIS.  It was a really nice and valuable ring, what kind of wife am I, if I gave away the beautiful (and  let's not mention the expensive) ring that my husband chose and bought to me with love and sacrifice?"
1258,"Withdrawing high denomination currency notes [demonetization] has been done before [1946, 1978]. However, I believe the present move [2016] might have a bigger impact than the one done by British India and Morarji Desai. This is a move I have been dreaming for years and glad that it was done.The fact that the government was able to do this so secretly in such a connected manner speaks volumes. Indira Gandhi tried this in early 1970s, but could not as the move leaked out and the bad guys quickly changed over the notes. The government had to back out of the move then. I’m even thinking if the move to ban NDTV was just a ploy to distract the whole media, to pull this off. And it was possibly scheduled on US election day likely to get the global media off the heat and attention, as foreign media has been ultracritical & condescending of any major move in India.There are 5 key incentives for this:Bringing out illicit money sloshed stashed in the parallel economyHaving a lid on the fake money racket supported by our western neighborIncentivizing India to go cashless. The banks would not hand you wads of the new cash, but will just credit the money to your bank account in place of your old currency.Moving the notes to a more secure standard - with better protection against counterfeiting.Curbing inflation in real estate and reducing gold imports.As the 6th incentive, it would impact coalitions ahead of the major elections in UP and Punjab. It is not shocking that elections, especially in these states with multidimensional politics [a lot of parties fighting] involve a lot of illicit money. MLAs get traded like horses - with suitcases of cash. Some of that trading will get impacted.Unlike in the past, I don’t see much impact on normal users of currency. The transactions that happen on Rs. 500 and Rs. 1000 should be moving to netbanking/cheque/cards anyway. If someone is still holding out against modern transaction methods, this is the opportunity to come out from under the rock.For the poor who don’t have debit/credit cards, there might not be much impact either - as most of their transaction happen under Rs. 500.Impact of the move1. Black Money & corruption: The impact on black money usage will be temporary as those would eventually move to the new Rs. 2000 notes in time. Also, a lot of the black money lies in real estate, gold and other physical things. Still even a temporary, small impact on this sector is better than nothing. The mere fear of government taking out your black money is good enough. That the government could so secretly do this will increase the fear.2. Elections: Especially with the major elections barely weeks away, the move would impact politics in the crucial states. My guess is that the government waited for the Diwali to pass [will be a huge pain for many to have this move before the festival] and do it reasonably before the elections [EC could throw a spanner on any major move just before the elections]. Thus, unlike the previous occasions, the government didn’t do this on January 16. It could have impact on corruption in those elections and it is a way of the government saying, “Maha Gathbandhan, Check”.3. Counterfeiting: The impact on the counterfeit notes would be more significant. Many “dealers” with the existing counterfeit notes would be stuck as they would have to take the notes to the bank and have better chances of getting their racket exposed. Thus, they are more likely to destroy their notes and incur losses. Losses to the bad guys is good and maybe some of them could get shot unable to pay their debts. It would be quite hard to counterfeit the new currency and until they develop the technology for that, there will be an impact on counterfeit notes and terrorism that is funded through that.4. Cashless society. All of the above things are temporary things. But, I believe the long lasting one could be in moving cashless. The pain of transferring cash could incentivize many to think about going bits and plastic. Today could be a day to introspect for the legal users of the currency. That could have a more significant impact on counterfeiting and unaccounted money.5. Gold/silver. In the short term, gold and silver buying will be hampered, as a lot of the buyers buy with their black money. That means less importing. Over the long term, there might be more purchase of gold as the black money guys will be afraid to hold too much cash.6. Real Estate. In the short term, prices of real estate would come down for the same reason above. There will be less suitcases moving. It is not clear what would happen to this sector in the long term. Maybe there could be a little more land buying, but that could be neutralized by the spiraling down of the prices that could go now.7. Markets. This is overall a positive move that is lauded by a lot of people and could bring more confidence in Indian markets by overseas investors. However, the exit of black money temporarily could cause other repercussions in buying. I would not be surprised if the market goes a bit down in the short and medium term.8. Overseas Indians. There is a lot of INR that gets transacted outside of India. Technically it is illegal [NRIs, foreigners can’t leave with rupee], but there are not many practical alternatives. They would be impacted as they cannot change the money to the new notes quickly and those overseas currency trading markets on rupee would be impacted [UAE money exchanges won’t accept notes in India recall]. Some of these transactions are good ones that improve the economy, while others might help Dawood bhai like ones.9. Banking to all. The government’s key objective is to bring banking to all and this will help that. If you have more than Rs. 4000, the bank will not give you new notes, but will just ask you to open an account and credit it there. This when followed with the fees on ATM transactions will make it harder to transact on cash.10. Consumption and economy. This is one thing I believe it is going to be negative. Black money drives a lot of the economy and now that it is gone, it will impact consumption levels. There could be a deflation and damp economic growth for a couple of quarters. In the long run it doesn’t matter though.Think about this. India’s total tangible wealth is of the order of 280 lakh crores. World bank estimates at least a quarter of this is black. That means 70 lakh crores. It is possible that 10% of it is in cash, with the rest in real estate and gold. That is 7 lakh crores of black cash that is lying around. Maybe 80% of it will turn white and even with that Rs 1.4 lakh crores of black will be gone. That is big.The government gave the black money holders enough time [until Sept 30] to come clean [Black money: Rs. 65,250 crore disclosed under Income Declaration Scheme] and following up on its warnings would make them take the government seriously in this aspect.On the whole, the government has announced that it is alive and bold. At a time it looked like the government was sagging and losing speed, it is a time to reinvigorate."

But as they say, it's better late than never. :) The number one song, I would say without battling an eyelid, is ""Little things"" by One Direction. I adore the lyrics and the vocals, everything in it. No matter when or where, this song surely leaves a smile on my face. This is the song I can actually listen to without any help of looking at the lyrics. :) The below three songs, I am currently practising listening to it, and I love those lyrics. :) ""All of me"" by John Legend. ""Thinking out loud"" by Ed Sheehan. ""Just the way you are"" by Bruno Mars. The below songs are great, but it doesn't take my breath away currently. :) It's on my future song list to practise listening to. :) ""Just give me a reason"" by Pink. ""Wreaking ball"" by Miley Cyrus. ""The climb"" by Miley Cyrus. ""Love me like you do"" by Ellie Goulding.""A thousand years"" by Christina Perri. ""Make you feel my love"" by Adele. ""Photograph"" by Ed Sheeran.""Count on me"" by Bruno Mars. ""Night changes"" by one direction. That's all for now! :) I also adore those high school musical songs, not all of them, but some like: Scream, Right here right now (my first ever song I listened to), Can I have this dance, When there was me and you, Walk away, Breaking free, you are the music in me, and so on. :P If you guys have any English songlists which has clear and loud slow vocals and less music with awesome lyrics, do let me know. :)  "
1261,"★★Interstellar is Christopher Nolan’s love letter to Stanley Kubrick’s 2001 - too obviously so - from the repeated HAL jokes to the score similarities to the use of monoliths to the total destruction of narrative as the film progresses.  It's also a counterpart to 2001 - a humanistic take that tries to say ""No! we don't need aliens, we can do it ourselves.""It's also a space movie that becomes less interesting once they get to space.SPOILERS FOLLOWThe film starts off quite wonderfully.  There is fake documentary footage using actors that are old enough that they could be talking about the dust bowl that ravaged the Great Plains in the 1930s, but they aren’t, they are describing the events of the film.  The film conveys a message that means a lot to me - that we’re a society drifting away from our roots as explorers.  McConaughey’s character, Cooper, says “we used to look up and wonder, but now we just look down at our place in the dirt.”  We learn that Cooper is a former pilot but now is a farmer, a widower with two kids.  A blight is infecting crops around the world.  It has devastated the wheat crops and is working on okra.  The farmers are surviving on corn.  Through the intervention of a strange gravitometric anomaly, Cooper meets a secret NASA team that is planning a mission to save the world.So far, so good.  It’s dramatic, well produced, the cast is good.  Then Michael Caine appears and Michael Caine makes everything better.  Anne Hathaway shows up with the weird kid from American Beauty.  They have a plan A and a plan B.  Plan B is to prevent extinction of the species by having a small team of astronauts take thousands of fertilized human embryos (don’t ask me where NASA got those) through a wormhole that has appeared near Saturn, to another galaxy that might have a planet that isn’t experiencing a dust bowl.  If that sounds wacky, wait until you hear plan A - to take the people of Earth through that wormhole.  Apparently the big round CONCRETE building NASA is hiding out in is a spaceship that can rotate to provide artificial gravity and ferry the people of Earth to Saturn.  Who was the science advisor for this film?Cooper was apparently a great pilot, but to his own admission only “stratospheric”, and yet somehow he is the best person they can find and super qualified to pilot a spaceship.  He, Anne, American Beauty kid, and a black scientist… wait, a black guy in a science fiction film… they wouldn’t use that cliche would they?  Why, yes, they would.  Sigh.  His days are numbered.  Speaking of which, has anyone else noticed that whenever The Walking Dead introduces a new black character, they have to kill one of the other black characters?  Just saying.Sorry, back to Interstellar.  Anyway, these four launch from an underground “launch chamber” in a giant Saturn V type rocket that in reality would have been destroyed by its own acoustic energy reverberating in a confined tube.  The space scenes are gorgeous, silent, vast.  Well, silent except for the screeching 150 dB organ music straight from 2001. Our heroes cross through this convenient wormhole and start to track the beacons of the dozen ships that were sent ahead to scout for planets.  There’s one small complication, though.  There’s a giant black hole named Gargantua that these planets orbit.  Getting too near the black hole entails relativistic velocities that would mean for every hour they spend checking out planet one, seven years will pass back on Earth.  But apparently the small shuttlecraft (and its pilot, who isn’t actually an astronaut) can make massive, fuel-sucking maneuvers to avoid approaching the black hole until they reach the planet.Planet one is ""on the cusp"" of the black hole.  We don't know where the star is that is providing the bright daylight on the planet.  The visit to planet one doesn’t go so well.  So it’s time for a sta..."
1262,"Well, when you buy the Apple Watch, it already comes with an armband in the box. The armbands are really expensive, one of them costs $450, which is more expensive than the actual Watch!  The cheapest Apple Watch is the Sport Edition, which costs $350, and it already comes with a band.Without the arm band, it looks awesome, but it cannot perform certain things, such as recognize your hand movement to switch on when you look at it to see what time it is, and it also cannot measure your heart beat, because of the light behind the device, which shines through your hand to measure the heart beat. The conclusion is therefore that the Apple Watch already comes with an armband, so I hope that this answers your question."
1263,"Can I say 1965 till 1975? This is the period when some great bands were formed and at their absolute best. Bands like Santana. Led Zeppelin, Deep Purple, Pink Floyd, The Rolling Stones, Yes, Genesis (With Gabriel), Jethro Tull, Uriah Heep, The Faces, Thin Lizzy, Humble Pie, Rory Gallagher. (All of which I had the privilege to see live) I could go on and apologies to those I may have missed. A lot of this success was down to the independent FM radio stations in America promoting these bands and not being scared to broadcast something a bit different and to push the boundaries. This was a time when money was flowing like water in rock circles.The later half of the seventies is when it all started going wrong. This is when the record companies started to buy up the FM stations and to impose playlists restricting the choices of the DJs. These playlists promoted whatever band/album that the record companies had sunk the most money into and had absolutely no regard for artistic merit. Not to say that they were bad however this is when bands like The Eagles and (the new) Fleetwood Mac came to the fore. All well and good for driving down Sunset Boulevard in your convertible cadillac but a total disconnect from a lot of the core rock audience. This became the rise of the “Poodle Rock” bands when it became all lycra pants and permed hair. All show and no go!"
1264,"There are no communist/socialist (c/s) countries in existence anywhere on the globe, and never have been. C/s societies are distinguished by the common ownership and democratic control of the means of living by the community as a whole. Logically, this entails a classless, moneyless and stateless mode of production based on production for use and free access to human needs on a global scale.The question is misleading by presuming that it’s possible for a socialist country to exist in isolation of capitalism and vice versus.The major ‘traits’ or characteristics of capitalism are: A system of society based on the class monopoly of the means of life. It has the following six essential characteristics:Generalised commodity production, nearly all wealth being produced for sale on a market.The investment of capital in production with a view to obtaining a monetary profit.The exploitation of wage labour, the source of profit being the unpaid labour of the producers.The regulation of production by the market via a competitive struggle for profits.The accumulation of capital out of profits, leading to the expansion and development of the forces of production.A single world economy.These essential characteristics apply equally to a mixed economy where the state have found it economically prudent to nationalise certain businesses or entire industries in the interests of the national capitalist class."

1267,"Fundamentally, the Canadian shield is an example of a continental shield, which is a large, exposed, low-lying area of Precambrian rock. It is the most visible piece of the crust that forms the North American continent or the New World continental landmass, and displays an astonishing tectonic stability.In particular, there are two important regions of the Shield:The Laurentian Upland, located in central Canada and extending south to the northern tip of Minnesota;Kazan region, located somewhat to the west of the Laurenian Upland(Wikipedia says there are three more key regions, but I can’t find independent confirmation of this.)Speaking from a sociological perspective, the rocky barrenness of the Shield has created barriers to extensive settlement, although the recently developed mineral resources of the area have created some economic development in the area.Sources:Canadian Shield - WikipediaCanadian Shield | shield, North Americacontinental shield | geologyKazan Region - WikipediaUSGS Geology and GeophysicsLaurentian Upland - Wikipedia"
1268,"Have you seen “A Beautiful Mind”? This is relatively simple game theory:The EU (the union of the remaining 27 states of the European Union) has no reason to sabotage itself in order to help the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland (the UK) pretend that it’s 1922 again (i.e. the peak of the British Empire). Britain has absolutely nothing to offer to the EU that the EU does not already have, thus the EU will negotiate entirely from a loss-limiting position.Furthermore, the UK cannot violate the EU’s stated “red lines” without significant, obvious, well-understood, long-term consequences. Somewhat ironically, many of the red lines are based on agreements that the UK authored.When your opponent is negotiating from a loss-limiting position, and you have bright red lines that are near-uncrossable, your only negotiating leverage is threat. Since the UK cannot relocate its geographic position, and since its economy is closely intertwined with the EU, the use of threats is likely to be extremely counter-productive to its own negotiating position.If you go back 18 months and press “fast-forward” on 1,000,000 different simulations of this process, you are likely to find that 999,917 of the results end up in one of two conditions:A no-deal Brexit in which the UK is forced to adhere to EU rules in order to survive (as in, to import enough food to literally survive); orAn abandonment (perhaps under a different name, such as “delay” or “postponement”) of the Article 50 process resulting in the UK remaining in the EU.That is a surprisingly simple conclusion, because leaving the EU under what is known as the “WA” (Withdrawal Agreement) is politically untenable for both “leave” and “remain” proponents. The WA keeps the UK under all of the rules and regulations of the EU, but takes away the UK’s seat at the table; in other words, it has all of perceived costs and downsides of being in the EU, without any of the benefits promised by the “leave” campaign.What is also obvious (although admittedly less obvious) is that a no-deal Brexit is similarly politically untenable. That it even remains a possibility is a reflection of political dysfunction, and not of any consensus by Parliament. Ironically, a no-deal Brexit is likely to be near-identical — in its end result — as accepting the WA, with the primary difference being that Scotland will leave the UK and rejoin the EU independently, and Ireland will go through a completely unpredictable metamorphosis.(My conclusion that WA and no-deal Brexit will play out similarly is based solely on the relative regulatory leverage that external parties hold over the UK; it is possible that a no-deal Brexit could play out differently, but each variance will have a high and predictable direct cost in the short-to-medium term to the UK economy, so those differences would be naturally minimized by those attempting to hold onto political power, regardless of party and regardless of where they stand on Brexit.)Having played the simulation through a number of times, I came to the conclusion late last year that the most likely outcome would be Parliament repeatedly going through the motions of pretending to negotiate an acceptable WA, waiting until the absolute last minute to admit that such a result is impossible, and then cancelling Article 50 under the guise of a “delay” (in a predictably mistaken attempt to avoid the wrath of the voters who still support leaving the EU). A less-likely outcome (albeit one being actively implemented by the funders and promoters of the leave campaign) is that the Parliamentary dysfunction is systemic enough that the necessary votes to avoid a no-deal Brexit will be politically impossible to arrange, such that the no-deal Brexit occurs by default.My analysis is only as objective as I can humanly be, which is an indeterminable value 0<=P<=1, and is significantly skewed in either direction when I am drinking. I estimated the likelihood of cancellation (a rose is a rose) at between 0.7<=P<=0.9, the likelihood of a no-deal Brexit between 0.1<=P<=0.3, and “other” at some nominal 0<=P<=0.01. Based on my analysis, I bought a few horses and entered them in the race, and thus I now must acknowledge that I have a horse in the race. Unfortunately, there was no simple “bet against the WA”, or I would have taken that one as a very safe bet.(Q: “What do you think will happen to Brexit?”)"
1269,"I recently discovered something very very interesting lately.You can connect to WIFI APs without any password.If you still can’t connect to WIFI APs after reading this answer visit the link provided, process is well explained there.At start I didn’t think it was a big deal or anything but I noticed that it is a very very critical vulnerability only when I turned the WIFI of my phone on while I was taking a 5 minutes walk and was connected to multiple networks that were meant to be password protected by their owners, along the way.Too many WIFI APs are vulnerable I have experienced it. You might be too, make sure you stay safe.This is seems super dangerous if you ask me. And when I say it I mean it.In theory there is no way of connecting to a WIFI AP without password, If the AP is password protected then password must be fed in some way.But I managed to connect to the router of my college within 1 minute and also was able to access the router’s setup page. It was a Digicom’s router and it was supposed to to password protected. lolBasically how I managed to access to the WIFI that was supposed to be password protected(all WIFI APs were hidden) is by just adding a few network names manually. namely rt5390_1 upto 5(just increase last number in ascending order and let the other part of the name same) And mind you the these names are universal and works for most of the routers.Main thing to note here is all WIFI routers with Realtek chipset inside automatically create WIFI APs without knowledge of the owner and don’t protect those APs with any sort of password.I will go ahead and say that it is a critical vulnerability. Just think for a moment how much damage could I have done if I wanted to.No sort of cracking or hacking was involved and I got access to the whole network within a minute to say. I’m experiencing just sooo many WIFI routers are vulnerable everyday when I take a walk and am connected to multiple WIFI routers which are meant to be password protected by their owners without even breaking a sweat.It really is very much more dangerous than it seems. Beware you might be vulnerable too. Edit: It can go both ways be aware.So, the verdict yea you can connect to Password Protected WIFI APs without any password.If you want learn more, here is the fully documented article on the same: How to connect to WIFI without any password trick, abuse vulnerability - Awesome detectAuthor is not responsible for your actions, this is just for educational purpose.Have a good day.Edit:Updated the answer to better reflect both sides.IMPORTANT CONVERSATION: It’s upto you.Comment: William Jago:How could I hack enormous numbers of phones using a honeypot WiFi AP? Perhaps if I could convince a large number of people to put the SSID into their phones and then forget about it, their phones would automatically log on to my honeypot whenever I was in range and I could hack away completely free of detection or awareness.The moral of the story is, don’t log on to WiFi Access points that you are not sure about. Exposing your device to unknown networks is an invitation to be hacked.Remember: if you cannot identify who is paying, then you are the product being sold.Reply: Suresh Thagunna:Well said it sure could be the case. But it is very unlikely to happen.If you are not on your own network then obviously there is higher chances of your data being compromised.One day you could be victimizing somebody and the other, you yourself could be the victim.“A man must make his own choice.”— Jaquen Hagar"
1270,"EDIT: I originally wrote this as an answer to the question ‘How did Portugal become independent from Spain’. It was subsequently merged with the above, and my answer no longer really answers the question. However, I consider my answer of good quality, and I put a lot of work and time into it, hence I will not be changing it.The above question is a fascinating question, slightly linked to the historical data I give below. If I find the time, I will weave an answer to the question into my answer, although it is already a very long answer.tl;dr:Portugal was a County of the Kingdom of Galicia from 868 until it was declared independent in 1139, and recognised by Galicia as such in 1143.It conquered all the territory of modern-day Portugal back from the Moors in 1249, after which the borders have remained largely unchanged.A succession crisis in 1580 meant Spain took de facto control over Portugal, but it remained a separate country.In 1640 a revolt and a subsequent war against the Spanish returned its independence, only confirmed by the Spanish in 1668.Background: Moorish Invasion (711 - 868)When Tariq ibn-Ziyad and his Umayyad armies landed in Gibraltar in 711 AD, the Moorish invasion of the Iberian Peninsula had begun, and would encompass almost the entire peninsula by 788, the forces being stopped only by the Pyrenees and the help of Charlemagne’s forces.From the 722 Battle of Covadonga, where Pelagius declared himself King of the Asturias upon victory, other nobles began to declare themselves ‘Kings’ of certain regions, such as Navarre (824), Leon (910), Aragon (1035) and Castille (1037). You might recognise some of the above as provinces of nowaday Spain.County of Portugal (868 - 1139)In 868, Portugal (which was then called Portus Cale, or ‘Port of (the town of) Cale’) became a County of the Kingdom of Asturias. At that time, its natural borders were the River Minho (currently part of the northern border with Galicia) and the Douro, which runs through Porto (and Portus Cale).From there, the County had much success against the Moors, sweeping south towards Coimbra and the River Mondego:please note that the labelling ‘Castille’ is wrong on this map, which also does not show Moorish territoriesBetween 868 and 1139, the Country was variously part of the Kingdoms of Asturias, León, Galicia-León, and Galicia. In 1112, Afonso Henriques succeeded his late father, Henry of Burgundy, as Count of Portugal. Henry had been the first to really push for Portuguese independence, and Afonso Henriques continued in that vain.After victory in the Battle of São Mamede in 1128, Afonso Henriques proclaimed himself Prince of Portugal (kind of weird, I know, considering there was no King…).Independence from León (1139 - 1580) (thanks Natalia Nezvanova for pointing out my lapse here)In 1139, Afonso’s armies defeated 5 Moorish Kings at the Battle of Ourique (location uncertain), declared himself King and returned to the County to have himself crowned. His coat of arms will have looked something like the below, with each shield representing one Moorish King, and the coins signifying the right of a monarch to issue currency, both of which still remain on the current coat-of-arms:In 1143, the Kingdom of León finally recognised Portugal as an independent country and a 1179 a Papal Bull further confirmed it. The Portuguese wars against the Moors continued in earnest, and the Algarve was finally captured in 1249, bringing the conquest to an end almost 250 years before . In 1255 Lisbon became the capital, and the the country’s borders have remained largely unaltered to this day. Spain would not become a unified country until Charles V inherited the throne to the Kingdoms of Aragón and Castilla in 1516.Iberian Union (1580 - 1640), Restoration War (1640–1668) and IndependenceA lot of interesting stuff happens in Portugal and Spain between 1255 and 1580, but doesn’t answer the question.King João III died in 1557, leaving the throne to his 3-year-old grandson, Sebastião, whose father had died shortly before he was born. João III’s brother, Henrique, served as regent until his majority in 1568. In 1578, Sebastião embarked on a crusade against the Moroccan Moors, and died heirless in the Battle of Alcácer-Quibir. His great uncle ascended to the throne, but died just two years later in 1580. As a cardinal, he too had no offspring, and Portugal descended into a succession crisis.Phillip II of Spain, whose mother was Henrique’s sister, claimed the throne, and met little resistance from the Pretender, a bastard son of one of Henrique’s brothers, and he was crowned Phillip (Filipe) I of Portugal in 1581, uniting the two countries under the personal, Iberian Union.Portugal remained technically independent but was de facto a part of the Spanish Empire. Still separate kingdoms by law, the Spanish would never lay claim to Portuguese territories in the Americas, Africa or Asia, but these would come under serious fire from the Dutch.Phillip IV of Spain (III of Portugal) had a different stance, and tried to make Portugal a province of Spain. The Portuguese nobility, who would have lost all their power, revolted and proclaimed the Duke of Bragança, one of the major noblemen of the country, and a great-grandson of another of Henrique’s brothers (yep, Manuel I, Henrique and João’s father, had a lot of offspring; 13 by 3 women, to be exact), as João IV of Portugal. This started a war of independence, known as the Restoration War, which would last until 1668, when Spain recognised Portugal as an independent country again.ConclusionPortugal first became independent from Galicia, before Spain was even a ‘thing’, until Spain became a ‘thing’, came to rule Portugal for 60 years until Portugal got independence again, this time really from the ‘thing’, although they were kind of always independent.

1271,"Though Pakistan being India's adversary it should not be forgotten that Pakistan's armed forces is one of the most professional and experienced  in the world with tremendous initiative. In spite of their  poor human right records and violations  of human dignity at Kashmir and  Bangladesh as an army they fought well with much superior Indian forces. Though radicalization of  Pakistani forces started from the times of gen Zia, Pak army is  still the most modern and secular  constituency in Pakistani Society ( This may be a surprise to many) . Further it has a modern missile force and  also a nuclear power. In contrast in spite of its bigger size  and economic superiority Iranian forces are  not a match to Pak forces and lacking in experience. The long Iran -Iraq war was much of a mayhem rather than a professionally  conducted war. So for me Pakistan is the clear winner. Self  Styled Patriotic Indians please do not get upset. Knowing  the strength of your enemy is the foundation of victory. India can beat Pak anywhere any time but that does not mean they are weak , but we are stronger. NB : My answer to Mr David Robert's commentsFirstly , I would like you to share the proofs of Indian atrocities in Kashmir, Side by side please also give the statics from how USA fought insurgency in Vietnam, Iraq Afghanistan etc-- and how Pakistan is fighting insurgency in Baluchistan , NWFP etc---. Indian superiority is a proven fact, do not forget the 1971 war and even the recent Kargil conflict. No denying of the fact that Pak is a nuclear state so as North Korea. Do you think if the requirement arises whether USA will be afraid of North Korea due to its nuclear weapon status ?? Same for us Indians. With its refusal to accept no first use policy Pak is having an advantage to initiate nuclear strike but (it is really a big BUT) what will be left of Pakistan after Indian counter strike ?? The Pak nuclear gimmick will not stand a real test . Neither the Pak army or Pak politician is going to open a nuclear front against India because of its sheer danger to them which is nothing more than total annihilation. ONE AND ONLY RISK IS PAK NUCLEAR WEAPONS FALLING IN TO THE HANDS OF JIHADISTS . In such a case it will be first aimed at WEST than at India . So be aware , Pakistan's nuclear weapons are not the nightmare of India ( we are used to live with it) but it is the black reality of the West.Finally we Indians never ever threw anything on Pakistan as commented by Mr David . We only want them to develop as a civilized , peace loving  and progressive democratic nation. It is the Pakistan who has repeatedly thrown odds at India              ( supported by the irresponsible complicity of West; which now is paying back to the West itself) and bought bloody nose each time.

1272,"To start from the beginning, static charges, as we know, affect each other by the electrostatic force. this is also known as the Coulomb force. It is an inverse square force acting along the only single possible direction- that is the line joining the two charges. But when the charges move (creating currents), the story changes. The static force (known to travel at the speed of light c) experiences a delay (retardation) in the action of one charge on the other. The result is that the static force direction becomes skewed from the joining line a little- resulting in two components .. one along the line joining the two particles as before, and a new one normal to the direction of motion. For zero speed this component is clearly zero, and all the force is static. When the velocity reaches that of light, all the fore becomes normal to the velocity, while the static force along the line joining the two becomes zero. For the other velocities between 0 and c, a corresponding deflection  of the force exists, and it is between two limiting cases of 0 and 90 deg.The new normal component is what we call 'the Magnetic Force'. It is always normal tot he velocity of the moving charge and it does not do any work- that is you can't add or take energy from the particle using this force. The magnetic force does not affect the speed, but only affects the direction of motion. The centrifugal/centripetal force in mechanics is a useful model to think about here. The centrifugal/centripetal force can occur only on motion, it is normal to the velocity direction and it does not do any work. Now if the charge accelerates too, another new term appears, a mix of magnetic and electric forces.. it is the electromagnetic field..it is what we call electromagnetic radiation. In the near field part of this, the field dies as  1/r^2, but in the far field part it dies as 1/r . I have given many references to retarded potential calculation in my previous answers."
1273,"My top 3 of the most influential queens in history:3) Elizabeth I of England (born: 1533; died: 1603)Elizabeth was truly the first crowned queen to successfully rule with absolute power. She never married and has often been referred to as the “Virgin Queen.” Elizabeth is best remembered for bringing the Renaissance to England. She is also remembered for defeating the Spanish Armada and establishing Protestantism in England, replacing Roman Catholicism. Elizabeth was the daughter of King Henry VIII and his second wife, Anne Boleyn and she ruled from 1558 until her death in 1603. She was last monarch of the Tudor Dynasty and her reign is known as the “Elizabethan Era.”2) Queen Victoria (born: 1819; died: 1901)Victoria’s empire covered 14.2 million square miles, spanning six continents, and controlling countries such as Australia, Canada, India, New Zealand, Nigeria, South Africa, and Sudan as well as many others. Geographically, the British Empire was the largest colonial empire in the nineteenth century and the largest in history. Victoria ruled over 400 to 458 million people during her reign. Victoria inspired a worldwide trend known as the “Victorian Era.” The Victorian Era influenced conservative religious and social attitudes, fashion, and politics in her country as well as in the United States and other nations abroad. Victoria’s reign began in 1837 and ended with her death in 1901. She ruled for 63 years; the longest of any British monarch.1) Catherine II of Russia (born: 1729; died: 1796)Catherine II, also known as Catherine the Great. She ruled over Russia which was and still is the world’s largest country geographically. Catherine is remembered for bringing Enlightenment ideas to Russia as well expanding the empire. Her rule lasted or 34 years, beginning in 1762 and ending with her death in 1796.As empress, Catherine continued the process of Westernizing Russia like Peter the Great and Tsarina Elizabeth had done before her. She incorporated Enlightenment ideas into her politics, commissioned art, and created a successful foreign policy. She also expanded the Russian Empire to the Black Sea by defeating the Ottoman Empire in two major wars. Catherine’s empire spanned over three continents: Europe, Asia, and part of North America. It stretched from the Arctic Ocean to the North, the Black Sea to the South, Alaska and the Pacific to the East, and the Baltic Sea to the West.Catherine reformed the system by creating a legislative commission in 1767, introducing a system of local self-government in 1775, and issuing the Charter to the Nobility in 1785. However, in 1773, a Cossack named Yemelyan Ivanovich Pugachev, led a rebellion near the Ural Mountains. This rebellion became known as the Pugachev Rebellion and its followers consisted of Cossacks and discontented ethnic minorities such as Bashkirs, Tatars, Kazakhs, and Kalmyks. Pugachev claimed that he was the long-lost Peter III who some people believed escaped from being murdered eleven years before and sought to reclaim the throne. The revolt infuriated Catherine and it contributed to her changes in policies. Catherine crushed the Pugachev revolt as well as other revolts around the country, placed more restrictions on society, and made serfdom even more prevalent than before. In other words, Catherine wasn’t about to have her power threatened by anyone or anything."
1274,"The exact size of array is unknown until the compile time,i.e., time when a compiler compiles code written in a programming language into a executable form. The size of array you have declared initially can be sometimes insufficient and sometimes more than required. Dynamic memory allocation allows a program to obtain more memory space, while running or to release space when no space is required.Although, C language inherently does not has any technique to allocated memory dynamically, there are 4 library functions under ""stdlib.h"" for dynamic memory allocation.malloc() : Allocates requested size of bytes and returns a pointer first byte of allocated space. The name malloc stands for ""memory allocation"". The function malloc() reserves a block of memory of specified size and return a pointer of type void which can be casted into pointer of any form.Syntax of malloc()ptr=(cast-type*)malloc(byte-size)Here, ptr is pointer of cast-type. The malloc() function returns a pointer to an area of memory with size of byte size. If the space is insufficient, allocation fails and returns NULL pointer.ptr=(int*)malloc(100*sizeof(int));This statement will allocate either 200 or 400 according to size of int 2 or 4 bytes respectively and the pointer points to the address of first byte of memorycalloc() : Allocates space for an array elements, initialises to zero and then returns a pointer to memory. The name calloc stands for ""contiguous allocation"". The only difference between malloc() and calloc() is that, malloc() allocates single block of memory whereas calloc() allocates multiple blocks of memory each of same size and sets all bytes to zero.Syntax of calloc()ptr=(cast-type*)calloc(n,element-size);This statement will allocate contiguous space in memory for an array of n elements. For example:ptr=(float*)calloc(25,sizeof(float));This statement allocates contiguous space in memory for an array of 25 elements each of size of float, i.e, 4 bytes.free() : dellocate the previously allocated space. Dynamically allocated memory with either calloc() or malloc() does not get return on its own. The programmer must use free() explicitly to release space.syntax of free()free(ptr);This statement cause the space in memory pointer by ptr to be deallocatedrealloc() : Change the size of previously allocated space. If the previously allocated memory is insufficient or more than sufficient. Then, you can change memory size previously allocated using realloc().Syntax of realloc()ptr=realloc(ptr,newsize);Here, ptr is reallocated with size of newsize."

Garrick Saito's answer to What type of brown sugar should I use in an apple pie recipe? Shortening.  Use shortening over butter.  Shortening melts at a higher temperature than butter, giving the batter time to rise and retain moisture.   If you want to retain the butter flavor, use butter-flavored shortening.  Alternatively, you can split the difference (use half butter and half shortening).http://chowhound.chow.com/topics... Eggs Yolks.  Add an egg yolk to the recipe.  Your recipe probably calls for an egg or two.  Remove the white part on one of them.  Egg whites dry out quickly when baked, causing you to lose needed the needed moisture for your chewy cookie (think french macaroons or meringue).Baking Powder.  Use baking powder over baking soda.  The cookie will spread less, since powder is more acidic than soda.  The thinner the cookie, the greater the moisture loss.My favorite goof-ball food scientist explains it a lot better than I can, with some additional tips.

1280,"Hi Buddy,What she feels when you remember her past?She feels brokenShe feels you don't trust herIt hurts her to the coreShe gets irritatedHer health goes bad since she is stressing too much on the fact that you can understand her past.Why you think about her past?Did you analyse that fact. Probably not. That's why you are asking this question.By digging into her past, you're actually making her feel bad rather than making her feel special. Its hurting her day by day and that's a sin you are making right now.Why do you do so?Let's analyse.You waste a lot of time thinking about her past. This means you have a lot of time which can be diverted to some positive task. Remember buddy, empty mind is a devils workshop. So, what you got to do is find something that you love to do and get it done regularly. You should find some ""you"" time too.  InsecuritySomewhere down the line you either have a insecurity that she will leave you or you have a insecurity about her past. In the first case, you don't have to worry at all. She loves you (read words about her section). If their was something in her past that makes you insecure then you should work on your confidence level and raise it to a new high.What you should do?Step 1 I also recommend you to read some relationship quotes, how you can improve your relationships. This will help you a lot.  You can also read some novels and books in your free times.Step 2Remember this buddy,Accept her past. See buddy, nothing is more lovable then you accepting her past. It is a sign that understand her. This will increase the bond and love between you. Just think logically. You weren't there with her in the past, she probably must have faced a lot of issues in her life. But after you have met her, she wants to stay happy and prolong this happiness for lifetime. So, just cuddle her and say I don't care what your past was, but I will make sure that your future is filled with happiness. ""You're my pride, my honor and my life. Can't imagine a second without you.""  Tell this to her and mean it. Your relationship will touch new heights.Divert your thoughtsWhen a thought about past comes to your mind, just divert it and think about the best moments you guys had together or plan for a dream date, or send her a compliment or call her and talk to her (not about past tough) compliment her if possible, or meet her. Think this...Whenever you do some action think about what would be the worst case scenario. If you pull to mach of past in today, then you are heading towards breakup. Can you take that? Are you ready for it?What if she is lying?If this thought comes into your mind, this means you don't trust her. If their is no trust their is no love. You are wasting  your time and her time. It will lead to a breakup.More Romance, More trust, better relationshipsMake her feel special and not her past. You're wasting time discussing about her past. rather replace it with time discussing about your present and future. Make her smile, make her feel good it will help you. Or else you're going forward towards breakup.Words about herShe truly loves you buddy. That's why she is sticking to you even after you fight regarding past. Believe me if it was some other girl they might have dumped their boy friend till now. She trust you a lot that's a reason she shared a piece of life with you. I trust you sounds more better than I love you. Trust me she loves you and wants to stay with you because you're special to her. But, when you become tangled in her past it hurts her. Do you like hurting her, then think about her past."

1283,"Firstly, you need to know, and believe it to be true, that you are ill.As ill as someone who is in the midst of a high fever. As ill as someone who has broken her pelvic bone. As ill as someone who is hearing voices that are not there.I began making myself vomit after the meagrest of food intake when I was about 15. I would eat a little bit of fish (my favourite food) at the dinner table with my family, then disappeared in the bathroom for 30 minutes, during which I made myself throw up. I would flush the toilet multiple times, clean up after myself as much as I was able to, and wait for the smell to dissipate.My family must have been aware of what was going on after a little while, but nobody said anything. It might be ironic to some, but I think that was an act of kindness on their part, as I had been so ashamed of myself then, even without consciously acknowledging the fact that I felt that way, that their interrogations would have shredded the last of my sense of self-respect.The next time I ate, a meagre amount again, I let it stay in. I thought myself “sensible” then, as I was taking in food and nutrition, while being in charge of my body.I did lose a little bit of weight, but wrecked both my mental and physical health. The human body is a survival machine. Even without self-induced vomitting, when there’s less nutrition available when you are on a diet, the body clamours for nutrition to compensate for what it has lost. My body cried out to me in the form of hunger, and an irrational obsession with food. I even dreamt about gorging myself on food.When I moved away from home, the self-induced vomitting transformed almost overnight into full-blown bulimia. I thought I had the best of both worlds: I ate as much as I could to calm my body’s cry for help, and then I vomitted, to appease my distorted mind’s disdain for body fat. It was a lonely and shameful time.I have since grown up from alienating and making an enemy out of my body, to an appreciation and fondness for it. I’m not sure how helpful it is, but I want to tell you that your body will win, yet, at the same time, your body is trying to win for you.Please seek help."

1287,"Not only is Iran no real threat to America, over past 3 decades in the America/Iran relationship, America and its allies are the aggressors.It was America that toppled a democratic Iranian government and put in a puppet (and extremely brutal) King that started the chain reaction that led to Ayatollahs. It was America and its allies that armed Saddam Hussein for his war against Iran. It was America and its allies that armed Taliban and Al Qaeda next to Iran (American record of funding terrorist organizations is shameful).Iran is a much more natural ally to the United States than Saudi Arabia. Their government is a different story, but Iranians are generally very secular. Iranian women are well educated and equal to men.Iran was briefly an ally after 9/11. Saudis have carried terrorist attacks in the US, Iranians have never done that. Iran doesn’t fund questionable madarsas (Saudis do).America and its allies threaten Iran infinitely more than Iran threatens America. The scariest fact of our geopolitical climate is that the United States and Saudi Arabia has funded terrorist groups (Al-Qaeda, Taliban and others) that threaten western countries whereas Iran isn't any direct real threat to America.America doesn't have to pick sides. India manages to have a great relationship with Israel, Saudi Arabia, Afghanistan and Iran.

1288,"Hello,I have a question I really need answered, I can’t get over it, and need closure. I would prefer a Capricorn man to answer this…if possible.I had a Capricorn man who was obsessed with me. Every morning I saw him (he worked in my building), I could see it in his eyes that he was attracted to me, he would undress me with his eyes and man we had INTENSE eye contact and this went on for months before he ever said something to me. He didn’t have to say anything for me to tell how he felt, it was very romantic. I found this so amazing I never felt or experienced anything like it yet I played shy, I was in a relationship at the time also.So, this went on for six months and he finally asked me for my number. I told him no and it was because of personal reasons. As they say the Capricorn man will never give up and keep going until they get what they want. The second time around he had his number written down for me and handed it to me. I was shocked, yet impressed and took it and took a little while to text him. When I finally did, he told me how beautiful I was everyday, he would check on me asking how was work a lot, and even offered to take me on dates. At he beginning, it seemed very casual, he was taking the friendly route which I really liked and everyday he never failed to text or contact me. Eventually, it started to turn sexual, which I was not trying to steer the conversation that way because I know Capricorn men are slow with that and don’t like women who present themselves in that way. I tried to steer it back to a friendly conversation but he just went all out about his desires and fantasies about me and the things he wanted to do to me I was VERY surprised (I thought Caps move slow?). So I opened up to him very sexually I was very turned on and couldn’t take it anymore, and nor could he. *sighEventually, I suggested that we meet up and make out since that’s what he kept begging me to do everyday. I assumed, ok he doesn’t want a relationship I felt bad because I actually really began to like him and didn’t want to move to fast. We met up and made out and all that but didn’t have sex. He seemed very cautious and shy and I thought it was so adorable, it was very passionate. After that meetup, I never heard from him AGAIN and he doesn’t work in my building anymore. A week had passed and nothing. I don’t get it, he was the one bringing up sex the entire time. I also found out the number he gave me wasn’t his true number, it was a app or something. I got really upset and blocked it because I was scared, I wasn’t sure if I got “played” or “rejected” or if I would ever hear from him again wtf, and now I will never know.I would like to know why this happened and what I should do? I know it may be too late, honestly I don’t know if I should try contacting him again or why he withdrew himself from me."
1289,"Im only an intermediate level german speaker but maybe I can help.First point is that in German, unlike English, nouns have genders (like in Spanish). Therefore, when you are naming objects, the particle ""The"" gets translated to die, der, das depending on the gender. In English you say the house, the dog, the cat. In German:Der is the masculine article, dog is masculine so ""the dog"" becomes ""Der Hund"".Die is the feminine article of nouns, and cat is a feminine noun so ""the cat"" becomes ""Die Katze"". It is also the article for plurals, so the plural of Hund (masculine) is ""die Hunde"".Finally das, it is the neutral article (unlike Spanish). House is a neutral gender noun and so ""the house"" becomes ""Das Haus"".(Note: in German, nouns are always capitalized)(Note 2: Gender of animals has nothing to do with the sex of a particular animal. The generic cat is feminine unless you want to specify a masculine cat, then it becomes ""der Kater"".)There are some hints about whether a noun is feminine, masculine or neutral (if it ends in E it is most likely feminine, Latin words tend to be neutral etc) but the best way to go about it is to learn every word with the article already to really engrave it in your memory.The second point is declinations, German articles change depending on the case the previous examples refer to the nominative case (just naming objects), in the accusative case (when you can ask what or whom) the masculine article changes from ""der"" to ""den"", and the other two remain the same.""The cake"" is masculine ""der Kuchen"" and in the accusative case: ""You ate the cake""""Du hast den Kuchen gegessen""There are more cases in which the articles change but I'll stop with these so it doesn't get too confusing."

1292,"Yes, very very much so.In my experience, a class of 30 students has at least 3–4 “애니덕후”s. 애니덕후(pronounced Annie Dukh-hu) is a combination of the Japanese “otaku” and “animation”.By the time I left South Korea(so a little less than a year ago), I believe the most trending animes were No Game No Life and OPM. Attack on Titan was also fairly popular.Many of them also happen to be fantastic artists. I’m not kidding, one classmate otaku was able to draw a fantastic and original anime face(with realistic hair and all that) in less than 6 minutes on a mini white board while we were preparing for an in-class activity.However, there are some people that look down upon them. There are stereotypes about otakus being fat and perverted(mostly boys), and having no life.But in my experience, almost none of them fit any of the stereotypes, with one being a class president and the other being a very popular girl that was asked out many times.Also, one of the biggest and most popular festivals was the “Comic World”. Its theme ranges from anime to Korean webtoons to western comics, and is a really big deal. Merchandise is also sold, and this is where most amateur Korean comic authors get income.Seoul Comic WorldMy sister went there to buy merch for her favorite webtoon about a year ago too(which was also drawn by an amateur).ㅇㅇ"
1293,"Continuing on from: What was Marc Srour like as a child?My teenage life can be summed up by two  words that are probably oxymoronic when put together: isolation and fun.My social MO of ignoring everybody developed to a peak extreme in my teen years. Even until graduation, I had never spoken to the majority of the people in my class, even though the class had changed only minimally since I joined (many of them had been together since kindergarden). From 13-15 years old, I had only one friend, an athletic, artistically-talented, filthy rich Georgian guy who lived alone in an appartment with his brother and a maid. They were pretty much above the law, with a powerful father and connections. I used to skip school with him to hang out in his appartment, eating French toast and mucking about. We were pretty close, sitting next to each other in every class we had together (evidenced by all my school books having awesomely-drawn penises all over the pages) - I helped him with homework (I was horrible in school, but my intelligence was unscathed), they kept me bully-free in school (nobody would ever want to mess with them). He left at the end of one school year, and I was a complete loner. My memories are very muddled from this time onwards - I remember having a surgery that kept me away from school for several months (and coming back to nobody noticing I was away!). But at some point, I made two friends, one of whom was by far my closest friend (and the only person from my child- or teen years I kept in touch with properly). She was a girl from the class beneath me, we hung out every break together, and when we had long afternoon breaks before a sports club, she used to come to my house for lunch, hang out and change clothes. This led to all sorts of teenage wankery, with my classmates being typical teenage dickheads, misunderstanding friendship for sexual relationship, etc. and creating all sorts of social problems. But whatever. She was my only real friend at the time, and it showed by my complete social awkwardness.One would think that being a self-appointed social outcast would make my education that much easier. One would then think wrongly. For some reason or another, my performance in school plummeted, setting the stage for all my future education. At first it was just test results, but by the time I was 15, I barely put in the effort to even give in my homework. I chose literature as one of my advanced courses, and never wrote a single homework essay in the last 2 years of school. I can count on one hand the number of passing grades I got every year. I was often scolded for having disciplinary problems. It was a strict school with tight rules about how the uniform should be worn, and about hair and facial hair. Nary a day went by when I didn't show up late on purpose. These gave me some notoriety, especially in the later years when I ramped up my insubordination.Maths was my most horrible subject - I was the only person in the class who didn't choose to take it past elementary level, a decision widely acclaimed by all teachers as ""extremely stupid"". My best subject by far was English, due to one of my hobbies at the time being writing. The English teacher often remarked about how my imagination and writing style could get me very far. Someone who knows me only from how I am today will be very, very surprised by that. And that's to be expected, because another thing that characterised my teenage years was phases. Much like Picasso, I went through phases where I stopped caring about anything except a certain subject. Someone who knows me today knows how apathetic I am about things I know nothing about (ask me about the Big Bang and my answer will be as pseudoscientific as anything by Deepak Chopra). As I said, my memory of these times are horrible, but here are the major phases in no order; by major, I mean the ones whose effects are still evident today.Writing. I wrote off-the-wall comedies and elaborately-plotted storylines, mostly reflecting my taste in movies and video games. This combined with a passion for the processes behind film-making combined to make me into an obnoxious film-critic.Programming. I learned C and python, and even started programming an MSX game, which, if finished, would have been the crown jewel of all my life achievements - it also had a complex storyline by me, character designs by me, and the most horrible music by me (it certainly didn't do justice to the relatively awesome MSX sound chip!). Alas, I revisited it sometime ago as an adult, and must admit that it's got the worth of a stem cell-less aborted foetus.Zoology. I already said that I languished in school, and biology was no exception. I failed it all. But that's because nothing in high school biology was cool. It was all cell, biochem, photosynthesis, biotech, and genetics. In other words, a program tailored to put people off of biology for the rest of their lives. I found a refuge in David Attenborough movies and the by me newly-discovered Internet, and nurtured an interest in the coolest part of biology.By far the strongest of these phases was the writing phase. So strong was it that I pretty much wanted to graduate and go to film school (and then to follow in my father's footsteps, he's a director/producer). The only reason I went on to do geosciences was, well, teenage trolling. I led everyone on to think I was going to film school, then changed my mind during the application process. It was pretty funny (for me at least).I had decided early on that I would go to study in Germany, and started learning German when I was 16. My social ineptitude was on best display there. I took two intensive summer courses, with two girls who I thought were goddesses also being in my class. I now know they were attracted to me (for some reason), but I was too much of an idiot to see such subtle signs as one of them asking if I want to go to the beach with her alone. The crypto-attractions only developed with older women who were direct, and I got a series of university students as girlfriends, only one of which I became close pals with (she died though).Anyway, all the phases were strongly supported by the fact that my brother went off to university in the UK, leaving me with two rooms to my disposal. My bedroom remained that, but I coopted my brother's room into my own entertainment and work emporium, and it turned into an environment not much different from Lain's bedroom (from Serial Experiments Lain), except the massive pipes were replaced by speakers, games, movies, and computer parts. And this then relates to the other characteristic I mentioned at the start: isolation. It was very rare for me to leave that room, and I spent many, many sleepless nights in there, watching movies, playing games, and hanging out with my friends on IRC, developing my wittiness in small anime groups where we were all very-close-friends-who-had-never-met (the type of internet friendships that leaves sociologists inexplicably baffled). I kept a strict separation between cyber- and meatspace though (influenced by Serial Experiments Lain, of course), and remained a mute in the real world.I'm pretty much the same now as I was back then, with very few friends to my name (and none as close as my high school friend of the time) and no awesome entertainment room anymore.Continued here: What was Marc Srour like as a college student?"

His tactful, fearless leadership, tenacity to take the blows face on & then come back with a counter punch, epitomizes South African spirit of cricket !!!I would say, the innings which be batted with a BROKEN HAND is a testimony to how BRAVE this man was !However, ably supported by the heart of the team- Jacques Kallis, the chainsaw- Dale Steyn, the saint- Hashim Amla, ABD, Morkel & others, they beat Australia in the own backyard 1–0 in tests.They also beat India in India, England in England !!!They were just marvellous…Except..For one thing, the WORLD CUP.They have earned the nick name - CHOKERS & media always plays the same cassette before any World Cup Knockout match, but we have to admit that luck played a major factor in their exits in at least 2 World Cups.Remember the Duckworth-Lewis Fiasco !The Modern Challenge…In short -WHITE RACISM & KOLPAC !!Back in the 2000’s, a faint trickle of white South African players started to migrate to countries like England, New Zealand, etc. where they thought they would get “equal” opportunities.Why?Because, in their home countries they were performing domestically, & when it comes to national team selection, “some random black guy gets chosen” !!! (this was what Pietersen said when he came to England)Now, this was really a worrisome issue, because the players who migrated were stand-up players & SA cricket was losing its potential stars.But, as usual, nobody took notice..Thus the likes of Kevin Pietersen, Andrew Strauss, Jonathan Trott, Matt Prior, etc. joined the English side, while Grant Elliot, Neil Wagner, etc. joined the Kiwis.What followed was history !Kevin Pietersen grew up to be the best English batsman since Graham Gooch !!!Grant Elliot won a hard-fought semifinal for the Kiwis in the last World Cup against his home country !!!But, as usual, people doesn’t act till it’s the eleventh hour…So, South Africa continued their talent drain…until only recently…Current News :…when their set players & World Cuppers like Rilee Rossouw, Kyle Abbott, Daryn Smit, David Wiese, Stiaan van Zyl, Simon Harmer, Richard Levi, Alviro Petersen, Colin Ingram, etc. made Kolpak deals with various counties & chose their “clubs over their country”.Now, all the talk started…The current SA captain, ABD turned a blind eye to this monstrosity, but SA cricket was genuinely concerned. There were even rumors that Faf Du Plessis & Hashim Amla will also go Kolpak, but fortunately that hasn’t happened yet.Thus the Current SA side, although still quite strong, has lost a number of players who would have been the future Kallis or future ABD…Good news is : SA cricket board has started to face the problem rather than running away from it. Improved pay structure, more home & away cricket & also with a number of world-class black players (like Rabada, Dala, Bavuma, etc.) emerging (No offense ! because 50 years earlier they would have been wasted…), SA cricket might bounce back in the coming 5 years or so…They have always bounced back from several deeply rooted problems & we hope they will do so now…:)International cricket needs a strong SA side..All the best !!!"

I currently have Spotify installed with a premium account on my personal cell phone, previous cell phone (no mobile data), and work phone.Of course when the phones are in offline mode, you can do as you wish, so I won’t speak further on that. When I have go “online”, it will log off any other devices that are not in offline mode. If you happen to be streaming music on one device and happen to log in another device, after a couple of minutes the original phone will either pause or log off and the newest phone in use will take over.In one situation while I was actively streaming and searching for music on my personal device a colleague decided to use my office phone to play his favorite music track. I was out of the office and my personal cell phone began playing the track as well. As we were both actively using the 2 devices it basically became a game of tug-of-war for control. I’d try to play my song and on my office phone it would suddenly begin playing the track there as well. Then the person in the office would try to play the song again and of course on my side I would hear the song selected by my office phone. After “fighting” for about 5 minutes, I figured my account was compromised and quickly changed my password and went back to streaming. When I got back to the office, a colleague told me my Spotify account was acting strange, and after he explained to me what was happening, I stopped and laughed then told him why.But in short, have multiple accounts on a mobile device, when you start actively using one it will log the others out. If you’re actively using 2 mobile devices, you’ll have an annoying game of tug-of-war."

1299,"Of course. This “worm” is sebum (aka sebaceous oil) and is naturally producted by all hair bearing pores. Having the worms sucked out by microdermabrasion is awesome because that sebum “gunk” can dilate your pores and make you appear like you have “large pores.” I generally have flawless skin except rosacea but the pores on my nose can get huge. My friend did microderm on me and he said it was really gross what came out—snakes, not worms. After that, my nose and pores looked great for apx 1 month! 2 WARNINGS: microderm can make rosacea worse, dermabrasion is very aggressive and should only be done by skilled and experienced dermatologists while microdermabrasion can be done by many. If your esthetician, nurse, physician, etc doesn’t know the difference, they might not be skilled or knowledgeable. Buyer beware."

That summer my sister took me on a trip to a part of Mexico I had never been to before and I just fell in love with it. In the airplane on our way home I decided right then and there that I was moving to Mexico for a while (I had never even lived outside of California before). I went home,quit my job, cleared out my bank account of what little money I had and moved to Mexico 3 weeks later. I had made a couple friends there on my vacation so I wasn’t totally on my own, but other than that I knew nobody, had no job lined up and I barely spoke Spanish. Once I got there I found a job as a bartender at a popular night club, made decent money and rented a little furnished apartment for dirt cheap. Everyone thought I was crazy for just picking up and leaving my entire life without any plans but I’m so glad I did, it was one of the best adventures of my life!"

1307,"I strongly disagree with most of the answers here. Don’t let “so called economists” mislead you who says after demonetization of 500/1000 rupees notes, the real estate sector will go down, without correcting your facts.People are claiming that real estate industry involves the maximum amount of black money, and as there will be shortage of black money after government’s bold decision, the demand for the properties will reduce. And as the demand supply graph works, lower demand means lower prices. The thing you are missing here is, real estate sector is not just about black money and pricing system in an industry is not just about demand and supply relation.We can divide this industry in majorly two parts to understand the effects of currency ban:1. Agriculture land and individual plots: These are the two types of properties which might see the downfall.These properties are generally bought long back with a very lesser amount compared to the present rates, so the prices of these two types of properties are completely depended on the market value. So if the market value of any property decreases, automatically the price of that property will decrease. Now since these properties involve the maximum amount of black money, shortage of black money will reduce the number of potential buyers from market, reducing market value, finally reducing the prices.2. All the other type of properties (Commercial office spaces, apartments, developer plots, villas etc.)These types of properties involve negligible or no black money. So the reduction of black money will have minimum effect on the demand of these types of properties.Secondly prices of these are not just depended on the market demand. A huge amount is first invested by builders to develop the property. So in these cases margins on invested amount plays a major role in deciding the property’s price. Since the real estate market has already been witnessing recession since last 3 years, builders have reduced their margins to the lowest. So there is no further scope of price reductions as no businessman will sell his product with a loss. The prices may stay still, but will not see downfall for sure.The mentioned points are the cases when the demand stays the same as before or goes down. But we should notice here that since the banks will be flooded with cash after government’s decision of demonetization of 500/1000 rupees notes, the loan process will be eased and the interest rates will be reduced. These properties were already being transacted without any black money, and now since there would be easy home loans at lower interest rates, demand of these properties might even INCREASE.So guys please correct your facts and stop believing everything you read. This time is the best time to buy property. The prices may not go up in a short span, but these will not go down for sure."
1308,"Up to an hour. Eggs are, like most vessels filled with fats and proteins, not that dependent on time and much, much, more affected by temperature. Yes, a quick and hot shock to the system can do wonders to the consistency of the Ovalbumin (the protein in the white), but it's more that it gets really hot, not that it was hot for an extended period.This egg was cooked for 60 minutes. You'd expect it to be rubber, no?If you want creamy, 65 degrees for 25 minutes do the trick as well as 80 degrees for ten or 90 degrees for eight. After that, coalescence slows down (at steady temperatures) considerably. To go from creamy to hard (""marmite"" stage) it takes an extra 25 minutes at 80 degrees, for example.For simplicity let's look at two approaches. First there's your ""general issue"" cooking approach. Bring water to a boil, drop medium sized egg in there, keep heat on.Here we have 100°C from the start, remaining constant. To reach the yolk from room temperature at 100° (and we simplify this here, of course there are stages in which the egg is at 90° at the center) it takes 7 minutes. To firm up at 100° it takes an additional 2 minutes (you can test this by dropping some egg yolk into boiling water in a freezer bag and observe, I just did that to verify my old numbers). So in this case you'll have 9 minutes for a hard boiled egg and around 5 for soft boiled. By then the time/temp equation has normalized and you'll see longer and longer spans between consistency changes. ""Custardy"" is about 5 minutes for a medium (Grade AA) egg.Secondly, my approach. It's simpler and less error prone. Add your eggs to cold water, turn on heat and bring to a boil. Now remove the eggs from the heat (turn off your gas, move to a different spot), cover, and let stand.From here just let it stand. It'll start firming up after around 9 minutes, but because the temperature drops with it, it'll do so slower. The Ovalbumin in the white won't rubberize (the 100° reach it faster and it reacts more violently, the perfect egg conundrum) and the yolk will set as hard but not go into ""flakey"" stage after 20. Take out a little earlier and you should have beautiful soft boiled eggs. I recommend testing this with your favorite brand of eggs, take one out after 10 minutes and from there on out every two minutes until you find your softboiled egg.A third option is to use a slow cooker with temperature control. Set your temp to around 70, drop your eggs into it, and let stand for 55 minutes.If you want to go even fancier, you can jerry-rig a passable sous vide setup for way under $100. I don't usually link off-site (especially not to myself) but you can read about it (and my eggsperiment) here: Sticking it to the Sous-Vide man."

A lot of college student are getting addicted and they are proud of it. Now, to leave it I have seen only two solutions. The parent are informed and they are strong/strict enough to make the child leave the addiction. One of my college mate's father used to send his son's driver to everywhere he went after he was informed of his drug addiction. He was not allowed to go out of house except college and the driver used to sit out of the classroom the whole time. We never found him smoking/drinking again, leave the drugs.

1314,"Growing up as a child,  I can remember every thing and every one around me reminding me that  reading was not something to be done for fun — but rather — reading was  instead something that “must” be done… not because it’s something that  I want to do, or something that I choose to do, but rather because it’s something that I have to do.And I believe that’s an absolute shame.Because reading is fun.  Reading is  powerful. And reading has served me so well that I’d say it contributes  to the majority of the successes I’ve experienced in my life — both  personally and professionally. The rest of it comes from taking  consistent and deliberate action on the things I’ve picked up from the  books I read.Today, I’m going to present 10  mind-expanding books to read in a life-time — but bear in mind: I’m not  saying you should take a life-time to read them. The more of them you  read, the more of the benefits you’ll gain from the books, and thus, the  more of the mind-expanding ideas you’ll be able to degenerate and apply  directly to your life.#1. Outliers by Malcolm GladwellThis is a book about success… and how there’s a lot more to it than being smart and working hard. Maybe you’ve heard of Gladwell’s famous 10,000 hour rule and how it relates to success – but even then – there’s still so much more to learn about how successful people became so successful in the first place. Outliers is a  must-read title if you’re looking to expand your mind about the  subtleties and nuances that contributed to the success of icons like  Bill Gates and Steve Jobs. #2. Cosmos by Carl SaganThis is one of those books that you read, and then just sit there and think. Cosmos is one of the most mind expanding books on this list because it  implores you to think about our place in the universe, and the fact that  even though we’ve come so far as a species, we’ve still got so much  more to learn about ourselves and our future.#3. Meditations by Marcus AureliusThis book was written over 1800 years  ago, and guess what?–The powerful principles written way back then  remain just as applicable today, as they did back in the 2nd century.  Just read this quote and you’ll understand what I mean: “For how could  we do what justice requires if we are distracted by things that don’t  matter, if we are naive, gullible, inconstant?” He’s got to be referring  to our texting and driving problem, right? Get the book summary here.#4. The China Study by Thomas CampbellIf you’re interested in learning about  the single most comprehensive book about nutrition conducted to date,  then this is the book you need to read. The research behind this book,  and it’s health and weight-loss implications will do more than expand  your mind, it’ll downright surprise you (and maybe even scare you) into  embracing a healthier way of life.#5. How To Win Friends and Influence People by Dale CarnegieThis is the original book on emotional intelligence.  Way before social scientists had the case studies to back up the  efficacy of human relations and it’s impact the way we live and the way  we work, Dale Carnegie had tried and tested his methods of positive  influence enough times to know their effectiveness. Over 100 million  copies later, the methods have proven themselves by withstanding the  test of time. Get the book summary here.#6. Flow by Mihaly CsikszentmihalyiYou know that feeling you get when you’re  doing what you love — and it’s almost as if time just came to halt? As  if five hours felt like five minutes? As if everything you were doing  just felt right? As if you were doing what you might be meant to do?  That’s called a “flow” state. And if you’re looking to get more of it in  your life, then you should get this book right about now. Get the book summary here.#7. The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People by Stephen Covey..."
1315,"It depends a lot on what kind of software you’re going to be doing with it, and whether it’s going to be your primary computer.For example, if you’re doing mathematical work on it, or simulations that require a lot of math, like architecture or other things that require tons of differential equations, you need the best chip you can find and tons of memory. If you don’t really know what a differential equation is, have nevver once touched MATLAB in your life, and you’re really just designed web applications or something similarly simple, from a computational load point of view, then the good news is you almost certainly don’t need that much numerical crunch power.If you’re doing large builds that would take a long time, you also want good CPU and lots of memory. But don’t kid yourself and talk yourself into buying the fancy machine for that; instead, get serious and do the math. If the total compilation of the entire package takes 6 minutes on a single-core i3 with a 7200rpm hard disk and 8GB of RAM, decide whether that’s ok before setting out on that 8th-generation quad i7, with 64GB of RAM and a 1TB SSD. Which would cut your build down to 1 minute (maybe), but realistically, what are you going to do with that 5 minutes you saved, and is it overall worth it?Now if the build is 2 hours on that single-core i3, you have a point. Now you need the big guns.I do do mathematical computing that requires big crunch, but not on my laptop. I have this godlike desktop at work that has 16 cores total for that.So 1) realistically appraise the performance requirements. If you already know that your programming on this machine will be basically using a text editor, then uploading that to some other machine, you can get away with almost anything.Then, there’s 2) get a 1080p screen. I find it virtually impossible to code on a lower-resolution screen. You can get laptops with 4K 15″ screens, but every coder I know with one says they have to use giant fonts to read them: 4K pixels are way too itty bitty to see on a small laptop screen, and I’d say a 24″ monitor is the plausible minimum for 4K.3) Portability. This means different things to different people. For a 90-pound woman, portability presumably means the thing ought to be light. Those are your high-end iMacs and Sony Vaios and whoever else makes a super-light, super-thin machine. If you’re a 200-pound guy, presumably carrying a 10-pound computer around isn’t such a hardship, and you’d prefer (a) to save some money (those super-light machines are very expensive), and (b) something more rugged.I add an additional constraint for the laptops I buy: 4) Extreme economy. Instead of one really good, really expensive machine, I prefer to have two or more similar machines, so that I’m not totally dependent on the one. My “motorcycle” laptop, meaning I carry it in a knapsack while I’m riding the bike, is a Dell Latitude D830 with a 1080p screen. It came from about 2007, and it’s got an ancient Core 2 Duo in it, aka the first 64-bit processors. These machines are so cheap (we’re talking $50 cheap) I can have several. The point is, if I get in trouble on the motorcycle, and find myself falling down (crashing), the very last thing I want on my mind is a $2000 piece of hardware on my back that I might want to protect. Instead, the $50 laptop becomes a “crumple zone” for my back - I couldn’t care less if it gets destroyed, and I can just take out the memory and the HDD to move to another machine, and be back up and running in no time.If I’m not on the motorcycle, I use these Dell Precision M4600 laptops. They hail from something like 2011–2012. These are performance machines, with quad-core i7s. You can put both an SSD and HDD in them at the same time. These machines, with basic HDDs and something like 8GB of memory, can be had for around $200 on eBay. Add an mSATA SSD and more RAM, you’re out the door for something like $350. As laptops go, these are big and heavy.Also, depending on what sort of programmer you are, you might be better off getting Ubuntu Linux on the thing (free) rather than Windows. My laptops are all dual-boot Linux/Windows machines, but I only rarely boot to Windows."

1317,"Why would your ex still follow you on social media after breaking up with you?This is a common question you see on daily basis, people breaking up with their ex and still follow them on social media.The truth remains that there are more than one way to this could follow.It is possible that even after breaking up with you he still sees you as a friend and see no problem in following you.It is also possible that he is checking up on you to know if you are doing better since he left you or you remained broke emotionally.There is also the possibility that he is still considering his action – whether he made a big mistake or not.The most important person in this picture now is you.Do you still love this guy?If he comes back will you take him back?Do you still think there is hope for your relationship with him?If this is the case then you need to make sure that if he comes back he stays and I can tell you that is possible.So many breakup happen because women don’t know how to handle their men.What is the difference between a woman that has her man thinking about her day in day out and a woman that can’t hold down a relationship?The fact remains that very few women know how to really handle their man not minding the type of person that he is.If you can be able to find his secret button, it is almost certain to get him to make you his priority.Yes, there can be one or more reasons why he left, but all these reasons could have been prevented if you took time to understand men, your ex in particular.I am sure that if women spent time trying to understand the secret desires of their man, it is possible that the issue of breaking up with you will be the last thing on his mind.Why would he leave you for someone else when you have all he needs in a woman?You can learn more from my article.

1318,"Biting nails with teeth is a serious issue. It may look frivolous at first as no serious harm is being done to your body and it sort of provides a deep relief and helps in overcoming internal anxiety. I disagree. The habit of biting nails is more serious than it appears at first glance.I struggled with this till I was 23 years old. I did so many things to prevent myself from doing this. For example: I would use antiseptic creams over my nails and fingers after shower, I used to put band-aids over thumbs and index fingers (those are the ones which I usually used to bite the nails from), I used to keep my fist closed while studying so that it acts as a reminder, I used to keep a nail-cutter in my pocket so that every time I put my hands in pocket, it reminded me what not to do. I used to put water over my hands frequently as wet fingers are relatively less susceptible to bites. I used to meditate. This madness was hard to stop. Nothing seemed to be working. I struggled with this for as long as I can remember. I suffered from this in primary and high school, in college, in my first job and so on. Very recently last year, I overcame this stupid habit through a series of hard work and will-power.Following steps helped me out (Not necessarily in order):Think hygienically: Biting the nails is of course not health-oriented. There are thousands of germs on your fingers and putting them in mouth dramatically increases the odds of you catching a disease.Think of how It reduces your self-confidence: Imagine yourself with a pair of hands which are so good-looking except for the nails. That is a real shame. If only nails were better-looking! It is important to remember that no matter how chronic your habit is, you can get your nails to be as good as anyone if you want. Nails are nothing but proteins and they grow in good shape very soon once you stop chewing them. Just use a little bit of nail-cutter on the tips, leave them alone for 1-2 weeks and they will start looking beautiful again. It will do your self-confidence a world of good. Think how cool it will be to have yourself in the best possible physical shape. Every time you chew a nail, you are making your body worse off than it earlier was. Remember that you have a choice here. Just resist the temptation and instead go and have a gum. Gums often tire our mouth and it lowers the proclivity to want to bite nails afterwards.Find a good substitute: Think of one other thing you can do instead of biting your nails. For me, it was taking the ring out of my finger and playing with it. It seems ridiculous, but you can use any other thing which helps. (Anything which is harmless and can be quit easily)Use nail-polish: This is of course not a permanent remedy. But, it helps in making the taste of nails bitter. Buy a nail-polish which smells terrible. (Since I am a boy, I had bought a transparent one). Put it on your nails and polish the nails every one or two weeks. Once you feel confident, you may stop using it.Use a little bit of anti-septic cream on your nails during the initial phases: It serves two purposes: One, it keeps the nail a little moist, which reduces the inclination to bite them. Two, the smell of anti-septic will turn you away or remind you of this. Once you are able to grow the nails in a good shape (in 2-3 weeks), then you can stop this.Think of your role-models: Imagine yourself having a dinner with someone you admire a lot. Would that person want you to do that? Wouldn't they like you more if you keep your hands, fingers and nails clean?Look at yourself in the mirror while you chew nails: It works. You will realize how silly it looks to have your nails in the mouth. That's how you look like when you bite your nails in public. Imagine that. It will give you strong motivation to quit.I quit it last year. It is such a relief. Now, my nails look so much better."
1319,"In France, dressing nicely is considered good manners, but not looking like a tourist is also a practical matter in Paris. The more you fit in, the less of a target you’ll be for scammers, pickpockets and people trying to sell you stuff you don’t want. It will also save you being stared at by disapproving locals in restaurants or on the metro. You will get better service wherever you go if you are dressed according to French custom.There are some rules of thumb that will keep you from sticking out. I wrote a whole article with lots of details if you are very interested: How to Dress in Paris to Fit in with the Locals — But here are some of the mistakes tourists make in Paris:It goes without saying, but obvious tourist tells such as visors, fanny packs or backpacks and souvenirs like your gift shop Paris T-shirt or Disneyland hat are better left at home. Keep the camera in a bag, not hanging around your neck.For WomenIn general, French women dress less casually day-to-day than Americans, but also less over-the-top in the evening. Leave your tube tops, short shorts and bandage dresses at home. They also tend to be more classic and less trend-chasing than Americans.French people do not consider sweatpants and yoga pants to be acceptable outside the gym.Shoes are important to not sticking out as a tourist in Paris. A Parisienne is not wearing Uggs. On the other side, a Parisienne is also not going out in six-inch spiked heels. Sneakers are totally acceptable, but not your actual running shoes. Super casual sandals such as flip-flops are never okay in the city.In regards to beauty, keep it classic as well. Heavy makeup, intricate nail art or overly-done hair will peg you as an outsider. French women don’t like to look as if they spent an hour getting ready.And a note on berets. Yes, some locals wear berets, but they don’t hang out at the Eiffel Tower or on the Champs-Élysées, so if you’re wearing one at a tourist spot no one will mistake you for French. If you want to just have fun and wear a beret cause you’re in Paris go for it.For MenMen should be careful not to be too casual or messy looking. Your “vacation wear” that you would pack for a beach trip is not going to fly in Paris. So save Hawaiian print shirts, tank tops and Hard Rock Hotel tees for another time. In the same vein, avoid overly baggy clothes.For Frenchmen, shorts are not city wear. They wear shorts on vacations near the water and that is it. Paris doesn’t get that hot usually and a hairy man leg out in the open is a faux pas.Just as for women, men also shouldn’t be wearing gym clothes unless you are actually working out. So basketball shorts, running shoes, sweatpants and sports jerseys aren’t good choices. Leave the oversized hoodies at home too.Men’s feet, like legs and armpits, are not to be exposed in the city. Man sandals will make you stick out and probably get you some disapproving looks."

1322,"What would be the point? Does anyone think Russia will invade the US and we'll all be speaking Russian? How would it benefit Trump to sell out the US to Russia? The whole notion that the Trump administration is colluding with Putin makes no logical sense to me. What would be the reason? Some have said Trump has business ties to Russia, but doesn't he have business ties all over the world? Trump is already rich, are we to believe he became President in order to make more money with Russia? He didn't need to become President to do that. Some have suggested that he colluded with Russia to sway the election. Okay, lets go with that. All Russia did, allegedly, was to leak some emails from Leon Panetta; emails that were true and not tampered with. That is a pretty slim reed to think it would alter the election. Furthermore, it is alleged that Russia tried to hack the GOP as well.Isn't it more likely that Russia hacked the election, both sides, to get an idea about where the election was going so they could plan accordingly. And isn't it more likely that Trump wants to have a good relationship with Putin in order to help defeat ISIS as well as get Russia to pressure Iran to slow down their Nuclear aspirations. It seems to me that the Democrats hate Trump so much they are deliberately pushing us into a Cold War so they can say, “See, we told you Trump was crazy”.I did not vote for Trump and consider him a terrible choice for President but this Russian “crisis” seems like just more sour grapes from the left and those few conservatives who want Trump out. In regards to Flynn, why would he deliberately lie to VP Pense about his conversation? What would be his motive? Isn't it more likely he got confused about what he said and when. Or even more likely that, in his desire to placate Putin, he might have hinted that sanctions might be lifted, but didn't want to mention that to the VP without mentioning it to the President first. It doesn't make sense that this 30 year military veteran, would flat out promise Putin to lift sanctions without the Presidents permission. Then lie about it, and think no one would find out. That defies belief.One more thought, the one thing that almost did change the election was the reveal of the “grab her by the pussy” conversation. Has anyone asked who leaked that? If anything was a game changer that was it! Yet no one on the left seems interested in who leaked it, which puts the lie to the idea that the left really cares about election interference."

1324,"While many online descriptions are valuable for validation purposes once you have a solid grasp of introverted intuition (“Ni”), I think they’re less helpful for first-time identification.If I were in the shoes of a non-Ni user reading such descriptions, I don’t think I’d be any more confident that I understood it well (in fact, I might even be more confused). Sure I may be able to describe it and recite the (albeit accurate) platitudes like “knowing without knowing” or “thinking without thinking”, but it wouldn’t mean that I’d have a deeper understanding of the essence of this inherently nebulous function.How my response will differ is by providing specific examples from my experience as a dominant Ni-user. Ironically, given that I prefer abstraction, I will attempt to “show” you the essence of introverted intuition through concrete examples because, after all, the point is to make it widely intelligible.First, to ensure that my response is comprehensive and takes nothing for granted, I will briefly condense some key themes shared by others into my own definition which I hope will feel “intuitive” to you.Introverted Intuition (denoted as “Ni”) is a subjective mode of perceiving abstract information.Let’s unpack this sentence, which concisely captures various features of Ni. First, it is a mode of (1) perceiving (i.e. taking in and processing information) (2) that is abstract (i.e. conceptual and general vs. grounded in the physical word and specific) and (3) subjective. It is subjective on two fronts. Firstly, by virtue of being an intuitive function vs. sensing, and secondly by being internalized and dependent on the “subject” (i.e. “You” and the “nature vs. nurture” dynamics unique to you).While the extraverted version of intuition (“Ne”) is focused on the external world (notice I did not say “real world”) and thus may be classified as “objective” because of what it’s referencing, its own nature is subjective. By this I mean that two Ne-users can look at the same “object” or situation and conjure multiple possibilities in terms of ideas/connections/interpretations and there may be some overlap, but it’s likely that each will have his/her own list with more differences than similarities. This is quite different from extraverted sensing (“Se”) which is truly objective – both in the sense of what it’s referencing and also in its nature of perceiving through the five senses. Generally, two Se-users can agree that it’s “cold” or “dark” outside. Of course, there are variations even in how we perceive things of a physical nature (e.g. durian fruit – smells/tastes awful to some, sweet to others…the “dress” controversy – black/blue or white/gold? Black and blue, by the way) so can anything really ever be truly objective where individuals are involved?The intent in decompressing the meaning packed into one simple sentence was two-fold. Firstly and ostensibly, to provide a working definition of the concept that is the topic of this post. Secondly and more subtly, to mirror the way that introverted intuition works – extracting hidden meaning and depth from the seemingly straightforward and superficial – and thus sneaking in the first example of the nature of Ni.Before sharing specific examples of Ni being used, it’s necessary for me to shine a light on its different manifestations that are commonly blended together into one vague definition. The way it’s popularly described it seems like Ni does one thing and that’s to predict the future. Sure, “predicting” is a big part of what Ni does, but far from the only thing.Based on personal experience as a dominant Ni user, I posit that there are at least four abilities of introverted intuition:“Knowing”“Sensing”EnvisioningPerspective-shiftingI will run through each Ni characteristic in turn, while providing the specific concrete examples that I promised. There will of course be variability a..."
1325,"I'd say your best bet is to shop the way you're doing it until you find one helpful person that you trust, then trust them to jump in their friends.  That doesn't necessarily mean bridal magazines versus the internet versus the versus facebook.  You could try for associations--whether the chamber of commerce or some Association of Wedding Photographers--because the kinds of people who join those groups are far more likely to be ""real.""  I personally go for a local BNI chapter whenever I'm stuck looking for a service remotely -- BNI is a networking group that focuses on people looking to hook each other up, so you'll get some very proactive hookups through there, and largely people who have worked with each other many times before.  Also, as I said, the Chamber of Commerce often has people who will go out of their way for you."
1326,"My sister is in 6th standard,they have internal assessment every three months or so I guess. There was a question in the English paper to write an essay about your hero and it was clearly written,"" that hero can also be someone who you personally know"". My sister wrote that essay on me (touched), stating that, I am the hero of her life.When she came back home after the exam and told us about this, my parents were really glad to hear this as we are always fighting and beating each other up. After few weeks she got the paper. She threw the paper, shut the door and started crying. We kept asking her what's the matter and she being introvert opened up the next day. She said that she hid the paper in the kitchen. My mother went and checked it. This was the reason she cried.​​​​​​​​​​​​Thing written with red pen by her teacher-""Your hero should be somebody whom you know well. Not your relatives""Needless to say she was given zero mark for this answer and she was mocked by her classmates for not writing the essay on Gandhiji which was given a day before the exam.This hurt me really bad, I really can't tolerate creativity and new ideas stabbed right in the face.P.S: As many of them have asked in the comment section that did my parents go to the principal. Yeah obviously,my mother had been to the school next day. My mother said the teacher responded in this way-""parents can't handle a zero in the paper of their kids and keep whining even without seeing that the answer written is wrong"". My mother tried explaining her how it was not all about the bullshit marks it was the wrong attitude that she has as a teacher but all that went in vain. She lacked the ability to understand anything. However my mother asked the head sir to look after this issue. And you all would be happy to know that she no more teaches there because there were many complaints against her. And about the handwriting, NO! I didn't cook up the story, I am a medical student (4th sem) we have classes 8-5 I don't have time to sit and write all this then take a red pen and do all this drama to seek any kind of attention. I mean what good would it do to me,why on earth will I do all this. This is her real handwriting, it's really good especially when she writes cursive. I wrote this answer just to share my experience sorry to all those who think I have escalated this issue. Even I am damn frustrated with the way we are taught and the way only those who score marks are applauded, I just wanted to share my experience with my folks.Thank you everyone for the response she read all the comments and had a smile throughout the reading, all I can say is she will sleep happy today."

1328,"Puducherry and New Delhi were allowed to have legislative assemblies considering the population of these territories.Pondicherry has been given partial state-hood. And, that is why it has its own elections, ministers and an assembly.Delhi was given a seperate assembly with a ruling body based on the fact that it is the Capital of our Country.When India got it’s independence and till 1956, Delhi was section C states list. After States reorganization act, 1956, Delhi became a Union territory which was governed by lieutenant governor with the help of metropolitan council and executive council.In 1991, 69th constitution amendment was passed and Union territory of Delhi was changed to National Capital Territory (NCT). In Article 239AA, it was mentioned Delhi will be given special provision which was a Legislative assembly and council of ministers.So, it was decided that Delhi will have 70 seats and council of ministers will be 1/10 of the strength of the assembly (7). one will be Chief minister and other 6 ministers.But there are difference between Delhi government vs any other state government:→ Legislative Assembly in Delhi can make laws on the all matters of state list and concurrent list except police, public order and land.→ Council of ministers of Delhi (headed by CM) will aid and advice lieutenant governor on the matters of governance.→ There is contradiction between Council of Ministers of Delhi and Lieutenant governor then Lieutenant governor can refer the matters to president and act accordingly.→ Parliament can overrule any law by legislative assembly of Delhi.

1329,"The Vision Through My SpecsSwan lake story:Virginal girl,pure and sweet trapped in the body of a swan by a evil sorcerer. She desires freedom but that only true love can break the spell of the evil sorcerer.Her wish is nearly granted in the form of prince. But before he declare his love to white swan, her lustful twin sister black swan tricks and seduces prince.Devastated, the white swan leaps off the cliff, killing herself. And in death, finds freedom.In the movie:Nina (played by Natalie Portman) is a ballet dancer who always wants to be a swan queen (the lead role of the act). In the starting of the movie, she was seeing the poster of swan queen of her production house as obsessively as she always wanted her photo there. But for the character of swan queen, dancer must play both the roles of gentle white swan and seductive black swan as they are twin sisters.Nina is beautiful, fragile, and innocent. She has all the characteristic of white swan. If there had a role only for white swan then Nina was perfect casting for it. But black swan is seducing, dangerous, sexually aggressive and completely opposite of white swan.Thomas, producer of the play, wanted these characteristics in her. Nina has hallucination problem. She actually imagines her black swan character as seducing. At railways station, she first time sees her.For the character of swan queen, her competition is new bold and confident dancer Lily (Mila Cunis) who could be the better choice for black swan. Thomas knows abilities of Nina but the attitude of black swan he wants in her, is not coming out of her. Still he gives her chance. He didn't want her to be fragile; he wants her seducing, aggressive. He knows role of white swan is not a problem but the real problem is how Nina would play black swan.She always strives for the perfection. Thomas asks her to ‘lose herself’. He says, perfection is not only about control but it’s also about letting go. From the moment she started dance, her long cherished dream was to be swan queen. She was actually dying to that role and when she gets it, she literally explodes in happiness.Thomas don't want her to be weak. He wants her to come out of her self made restriction zone. He wants her to be expressive about her feelings.The character of black swan has eaten up earlier swan queen Beth too as indicated by this scene.She throws her toys as now she is not the same girls she used to be. She actually imagines her black swan character as Lily. It is interesting to see that she is fighting with herself as she is not able to distinguish between real and imagination (hallucination). As what happens in Swan Lake story, is parallel happening in the movie. She wants Thomas to believe in her but she thinks Lily is seducing Thomas to get her role and Thomas is getting attracted towards her...."

When you come back on your Xbox 1, you will have the ranks and other goodies (unless Rockstar Games banned you, watch out!) on the Xbox 1. You won’t have the mods and all that as GTA V on Next-Gen is updated and different.P.S. I am in NO WAY responsible for ANY damage caused to you or your property.-Deadshot341"
1332,"Here is the state of the world now (only highlights).North Korea- Has missiles and Nukes in its stockpile. Their missiles do not have enough range to reach continental US. Even if they somehow manage to strike a few Nukes at the US, it will only affect the impact zones immediately. So it will result in the total wipe out of NK in the US’s retaliation. North does not want to nuke the south coz their first goal is to take over the south and unite the Koreas. It does not want to attack any of its neighbors simply because there are no compelling reasons to do so for North. So there’s no real threat.Russia- She has a lot of technologically advanced weapons. Some even better than the US. She has a stock pile of Nukes and intercontinental ballistic missiles. But they have one thing working against them. Their own economy. Their economy is weak. They cannot keep the supplies alive to support an all out war or an invasion. No place can be dominated or occupied without boots on the ground. So there’s no real threat.China- She has the largest army. Lot of hardware, strong economy, many missiles and long history as well. What is working against them is their size and their political leadership. Most of the weapons in their arsenal are old and reverse engineered stuff from the Soviet era. They are modernizing however, but not at the rates they want. Also their navy and air force does not have enough hardware to back an invasion. So no real threat.India- Certainly a large number of people, large army. Relatively modern Air force and Navy. India is historically peaceful and non-aggressive they have stood their ground against aggressors but never pushed back. Also the air force does not have the infrastructure to support an invasion. Navy has inadequate number of modern vessels. Submarine fleet is aging. Modernization is happening at a snail’s pace. Political leadership is not helping with the process either. So no real threat.Europe- Collectively, very powerful and has strategic advantage over the rest of the world due to sheer strength and size of hardware of individual members and the collective strategic knowledge and experience. However, Europe is not as united as they wish to be. Member nations have trust issues with each other due to leftover emotions from previous two world wars. Also there is an impending financial crisis and a social crisis due to the refugee movement. So no real threat.Africa-Individual nations(some of them) may be strong enough to defend own territories against invaders, however none of the African nations are strong enough to launch a war or an invasion against even their Asian neighbors; let alone European or American. Also, most of the continent is torn apart by countless civil wars, racial and tribal conflicts and regional disputes. There is not enough reasons for an outward spill-over of the conflicts. So no real threat.South America- Same as Africa. Third world countries, slow or crippled economies, poverty, smaller, largely inadequate military forces. There are no compelling reasons for them to cause a large scale conflict, let alone global. So no real threat.Middle East- There are a few who can put up a real tough fight against an invading foreign military.Their situational awareness, familiarity with terrain and guerrilla tactics are all advantageous but only works withing the region so they are only good at defense. Certain countries possess good hardware and moderately large modern armed forces. However, none of the Middle Eastern countries possess the military strength to lead an invasion on foreign land or sustain the defense of their own territories for a long time (including Iran). Also they are not synonymous with the modern equipment that they possess. This is because of lack of experience in large scale multi-face, multi-theater warfare and lack of trust between troops. This seriously undermines the collective efforts. So no real threat.Last but not least,USA- Uncle Sam checks off all items on the list when it comes to size, numbers and weaponry. Certainly strong, economy wise. Has a global reach and has lead countless invasions, successfully. They are already the dominating force and has a firm hand of control over the world with many military bases in strategic locations across the entire planet. She is ruling the world now, at least by a big margin (Economically, politically and strategically). So she wouldn’t do anything that would start a third world war and cause a global meltdown. Because once the world goes in to the chaos of war, the balance of power might tip against them. Off course she will get involved in many other small scale conflicts, trying to bring down a dictatorship or install a new one, home-delivering freedom and democracy to the needful. Still, no real threat.Unless something dramatic plays out anytime soon or some nut job decides to let some nukes loose willy-nilly, we are certainly not heading towards a third world war. So just relax and have a cold beer."

1334,"Umm…Roll over in her grave?Because by then she’d be dead…Either by the Valonqar(means ‘little brother’) as prophesied by Maegi the Frog(it was left out of the scene in the TV show where Maegi tells a younger Cersei about how her children will die but is part of the prophecy in the books) or by Daenerys, or by Jon…My money is on the Valonqar/Little Brother… and I DON’T mean TyrionJaime was born a few minutes after Cersei, so fan money is on Jaime doing the deed… and why not? He’s done every other kind of ‘deed’ with her….But seriously, in the end, I think it will not only be Jaime who kills her, but Jaime who deserves to kill her the most.So, to answer your question…Ya, roll over in her grave.Valar Morghulis!-Nismo"
